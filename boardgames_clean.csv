1;Die Macher;"Die Macher is a game about seven sequential political races in different regions of Germany. Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The 1986 edition featured four parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players. The 1997 edition supports up to five players in the re-united Germany and updated several features of the rules as well.  The 2006 edition also supports up to five players and adds a shorter five-round variant and additional rules updates by the original designer.&#10;&#10;";1986;7.58934;4.3081;die macher game seven sequential political race different region germany player charge national political party manage limited resource help party victory win party victory point regional election different way scoring victory point regional election supply eighty victory point depend size region party second party win regional election medium influence region party receive medium control victory point party national party membership grow game progress supply fair number victory point lastly party score victory point party platform match national opinion end game edition feature party old west germany support player edition support player united germany update feature rule edition support player add short round variant additional rule update original designer
2;Dragonmaster;"Dragonmaster is a trick-taking card game based on an older game called Coup d'&#195;&#137;tat. Each player is given a supply of plastic gems, which represent points. Each player will get to be the dealer for five different hands, with slightly different goals for each hand. After all cards have been dealt out, the dealer decides which hand best suits his or her current cards, and the other players are penalized points (in the form of crystals) for taking certain tricks or cards. For instance, if &quot;first&quot; or &quot;last&quot; is called, then a player is penalized for taking the first or last tricks. All players will get a chance to be dealer for five hands, but other players can steal this opportunity by taking all of the tricks during certain hands. At the end, the biggest pile of gems wins the game.&#10;&#10;Jewel contents:&#10;&#10;10 clear (2 extra)&#10;14 green (2 extra)&#10;22 red (2 extra)&#10;22 blue (2 extra)&#10;&#10;";1981;6.65971;1.9643;dragonmaster trick taking card game base old game call coup d tat player give supply plastic gem represent point player dealer different hand slightly different goal hand card deal dealer decide hand good suit current card player penalize point form crystal take certain trick card instance quot quot quot quot call player penalize take trick player chance dealer hand player steal opportunity take trick certain hand end big pile gem win game jewel content clear extra green extra red extra blue extra
3;Samurai;"Samurai is set in medieval Japan. Players compete to gain the favor of three factions: samurai, peasants, and priests, which are represented by helmet, rice paddy, and Buddha figures scattered about the board, which features the islands of Japan. The competition is waged through the use of hexagonal tiles, each of which help curry favor of one of the three factions &mdash; or all three at once! Players can make lightning-quick strikes with horseback ronin and ships or approach their conquests more methodically. As each figure (helmets, rice paddies, and Buddhas) is surrounded, it is awarded to the player who has gained the most favor with the corresponding group.&#10;&#10;Gameplay continues until all the symbols of one type have been removed from the board or four figures have been removed from play due to a tie for influence.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players compare captured symbols of each type, competing for majorities in each of the three types. Ties are not uncommon and are broken based on the number of other, &quot;non-majority&quot; symbols each player has collected.&#10;&#10;The game is part of what is sometimes called the Knizia tile-laying trilogy.&#10;&#10;";1998;7.47612;2.4423;samurai set medieval japan player compete gain favor faction samurai peasant priest represent helmet rice paddy buddha figure scatter board feature island japan competition wage use hexagonal tile help curry favor faction mdash player lightning quick strike horseback ronin ship approach conquest methodically figure helmet rice paddy buddha surround award player gain favor correspond group gameplay continue symbol type remove board figure remove play tie influence end game player compare capture symbol type compete majority type tie uncommon break base number quot non majority quot symbol player collect game call knizia tile lay trilogy
4;Tal der KÃ¶nige;"When you see the triangular box and the luxurious, large blocks of Tal der K&ouml;nige (German: &quot;Valley of the Kings&quot;), you can tell this game was designed to be beautiful as well as functional.  The object of the game is to build pyramids out of the different colored blocks.  A pyramid scores more points when it's made from a few colors, but it's much harder to consistently outbid the other players for the necessary blocks.  The game is over when the Pharoah's Pyramid in the center is completed, which is built using all the blocks that the players don't use during the course of the game.&#10;&#10;Final round 1990 Hippodice Spieleautorenwettbewerb.&#10;&#10;";1992;6.6154;2.6875;triangular box luxurious large block tal der k ouml nige german quot valley king quot tell game design beautiful functional object game build pyramid different colored block pyramid score point s color s hard consistently outbid player necessary block game pharoah s pyramid center complete build block player don t use course game final round hippodice spieleautorenwettbewerb
5;Acquire;"In Acquire, each player strategically invests in businesses, trying to retain a majority of stock.  As the businesses grow with tile placements, they also start merging, giving the majority stockholders of the acquired business sizable bonuses, which can then be used to reinvest into other chains.  All of the investors in the acquired company can then cash in their stocks for current value or trade them 2-for-1 for shares of the newer, larger business.  The game is a race to acquire the greatest wealth.&#10;&#10;History of Acquire: This Sid Sackson classic has taken many different forms over the years depending on the publisher, yet the rules and game play have stayed the same. The 1966 version of the 3M bookshelf edition included rules for a 2-player variant. The original version is part of the 3M Bookshelf Series.&#10;&#10;Many books and websites incorrectly list this as a 1962 publication as the 3M Company used previously copyrighted artwork when they released the game in 1964. 3M actually received the idea for the game of &quot;Vacations&quot; from Sid Sackson in May of 1963 and decided to take his idea and put it into artwork they had developed the year before for a game called &quot;ACQUIRE.&quot; 3M's original game idea for a game called ACQUIRE must not have been very good so they decided to take Sid's idea of Vacations and put it into their concept of ACQUIRE. They released some limited test market games in 8 Midwestern U.S. cities in December of 1963 with a box that had a 1963 copyright. These games had Sid's original rules. When 3M released the mass market games in 1964, they had developed some of Sid's original ideas and changed some rules and game play to match their production desires. They released them with outer boxes that were copyrighted 1962 and inner boxes with rules that were dated 1963.&#10;&#10;December 1963 - Test Market World Map Wood Tile Edition&#10;1964 - Dated 1962/63 wood tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay &amp; stocks with printed backs&#10;1965 - Dated 1962/63 plastic tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay &amp; stocks with printed backs (last edition made with printed backs until 1999)&#10;1966 - Dated 1962/66 plastic tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay &amp; non-wax coated stocks (Only edition with these stocks)&#10;1968 - Dated 1968/66 plastic tiles, clear plastic board with paper underlay (Both 1966 inner box games have a lot of mixed parts)&#10;1971 - Dated 1968/71 plastic tiles, yellow hard plastic board&#10;1975 - 3M sells rights for game of ACQUIRE to the Avalon Hill Company&#10;1976 - Dated 1976 plastic tiles, yellow hard plastic board, redesigned money, no inner box (This edition was also produced in 1977, 79, 81, 82,       &amp; 86)&#10;1989 - Dated 1976 Gray box edition with new box artwork same contents as regular 1976 editions (This edition was also produced in 1992)&#10;1995 - Dated 1995 Large box cardboard edition with chipboard board and tiles, Special Powers Variant Tiles inspired by German editions&#10;1997 - Avalon Hill sells the rights to the game of ACQUIRE to Hasbro&#10;1999 - Dated 1999 Large box with large plastic board and tiles, 3D company buildings, redesigned stocks &amp; money, large info cards&#10;2006 - Hasbro assigns rights for the game of ACQUIRE to their subsidiary, Wizards of the Coast&#10;2006 - Lloyd's (private) Rules of ACQUIRE are made public, two major rule changes that help to bring the balance of the game of ACQUIRE back to the  intentions of Sid Sackson's original ideas.

6;Mare Mediterraneum;"In the ancient lands along the Mediterranean, players attempt to satisfy their unique victory conditions via trade, war and construction.  This lavishly produced game contains tons of wooden game components and a beautiful roll-out vinyl map.  Players produce a score of different commodities to trade with other cities in the hope of creating enough income to fill their capitals with buildings, produce artwork, and fill warehouses with goods.&#10;&#10;";1989;6.4523;3.0;ancient land mediterranean player attempt satisfy unique victory condition trade war construction lavishly produce game contain ton wooden game component beautiful roll vinyl map player produce score different commodity trade city hope create income fill capital building produce artwork fill warehouse good
7;Cathedral;"In Cathedral, each player has a set of pieces of a different color. The pieces are in the shapes of buildings, covering from one to five square units. The first player takes the single neutral Cathedral piece and places it onto the board. Players then alternate placing one of their buildings onto the board until neither player can place another building. Players capture territory by surrounding areas that are occupied by at most one opponent or neutral building. A captured piece is removed and captured territory becomes off-limits to the opponent. The player with the fewest 'square units' of buildings that can't be placed wins.&#10;&#10;";1979;6.54931;1.7887;cathedral player set piece different color piece shape building cover square unit player take single neutral cathedral piece place board player alternate place building board player place building player capture territory surround area occupy opponent neutral building capture piece remove capture territory limit opponent player few square unit building t place win
8;Lords of Creation;"In this interesting offering from Warfrog, players become Gods seeking to dominate a world with their followers.  The first part of the game involves constructing the game board, after which players take turns using cards to determine how many new people should appear and what type of terrain they will inhabit.  All tribes start off as barbarians, but soon the calming effect of civilization settles the marauding bands; although civilized tribes score more, they can no longer attack.  What they can do, though, is civilize other players' followers.  Sure it gives opponents more points, but at least those followers won't come after you!&#10;&#10;";1993;6.05322;2.4;interesting offering warfrog player god seek dominate world follower game involve construct game board player turn card determine new people appear type terrain inhabit tribe start barbarian soon calming effect civilization settle marauding band civilized tribe score long attack civilize player follower sure give opponent point follower win t come
9;El Caballero;"Although referred to as a sequel to El Grande, El Caballero shares few aspects with its namesake, being a fun but intense brain-burner in which players explore and attempt to control the lands and waterways of the New World.&#10;&#10;The players are following Columbus by exploring the islands he discovered. Players slowly explore the islands &ndash; by picking and placing land tiles that are most favorable to them &ndash; and discover wealth in the form of gold and fish. As they learn about the land and sea areas of this new land, they position their caballeros to try to maintain control of the important regions. Castillos give them a measure of protection from others, and ships allow them to establish trade and to fish for food. Success is measured in the size of land and sea areas they control. Their success is measured twice, and in the end these scores are summed and the winner declared.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.47043;2.9515;refer sequel el grande el caballero share aspect namesake fun intense brain burner player explore attempt control land waterway new world player follow columbus explore island discover player slowly explore island ndash pick place land tile favorable ndash discover wealth form gold fish learn land sea area new land position caballero try maintain control important region castillo measure protection ship allow establish trade fish food success measure size land sea area control success measure twice end score sum winner declare
10;Elfenland;"Elfenland is a redesign of the original White Wind game Elfenroads.  The game is set in the mythical world of the elves.  A group of fledgling elves (the players) are charged with visiting as many of the twenty Elfencities as they can over the course of 4 rounds.  To accomplish the task they will use various forms of transportation such as Giant Pigs, Elfcarts, Unicorns, Rafts, Magic Clouds, Trollwagons, and Dragons.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:  Players begin in the Elf capitol, draw one face down movement tile, and are dealt eight transport cards and a secret 'home' city card that they must reach at the end of the 4th round or lose points for each city space away from 'home' they are at the end of the game. Markers of each player's color are placed in each city on the board and are collected when the player visits that city (each counts as 1 point).&#10;  &#10;     The round proceeds in 2 stages.  The first part of the round consists of the drawing of Tiles showing the differing types of transport (except rafts) from a combination of face up and face down tiles (if a player doesn't like the 5 tiles that are face up; they can always draw blind from the face down tiles and hope to get one they need).  These transport tiles need to match the Transportation cards in your hand to use them most effectively.  After each player has a total of 4 tiles they take turns placing a tile on any one of the roads that run between the elf cities.  Only one transport tile may be placed on each road; so players may use other players tiles to travel if they have the matching cards in their hand.  This frequently causes a readjustment of planned travel routes as other players tiles can allow you to move farther or shorter than you had first thought.  Players can play their tiles to help themselves or hinder others by playing a slow mode of transport on another players (perceived) path.&#10;&#10;Each mode of transport has certain terrain it can travel through quickly or slowly, and those that it cannot. These are listed on the top of each transportation card by the number terrain symbols.  The number of terrain symbols equals how many matching cards you must play to move across a given tile in a given terrain.  For example, a Magic Cloud tile placed in a mountain would take one Magic cloud card to travel across (1 mountain symbol on card means Magic clouds are fast in mountains). If the same tile was placed on a road in forest terrain it would require 2 Magic Cloud cards to travel that route (2 Forest symbols on card means Magic Clouds are slow in Forest).  Magic Clouds cannot travel in desert terrain at all (no desert symbols on card). All modes of transport are different and Rafts can be used on rivers or lakes without needing tiles. Rafts go slow upstream (2 raft cards needed) and fast downstream (1 card needed).  The small lake requires 1 raft card to travel across and the larger lake requires 2 cards to travel across.  Players may keep one unused transport counter and up to 4 Transportation cards from one round to the next.&#10;&#10;The second part of the round begins after all players have finished placing their transportation tiles for the round.  Each player plays his cards and moves his elf-boot around the board collecting his tokens from the cities visited.  If there is a Transport tile on a route and a player has no matching Transportation card he may 'Caravan' across it by playing any 3 Transportation cards from his hand.&#10;&#10;As a bit of 'take that' each player has a trouble tile which can be placed next to any transportation tile during the first part of the round.  This counter means that in order to travel that path an additional card of the transport type must be played or 4 cards to 'Caravan'.&#10;&#10;Victory: if at the end of round 3 a player has visited all 20 cities he is the winner.  If not the game ends after round 4 when 'Home' cities are revealed and each player subtracts points for each city he is away from his 'home' subtracting that from his collected city tokens.  The person with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.67173;2.1511;elfenland redesign original white wind game elfenroad game set mythical world elf group fledgling elve player charge visit elfencitie course round accomplish task use form transportation giant pig elfcart unicorn raft magic cloud trollwagon dragon gameplay player begin elf capitol draw face movement tile deal transport card secret home city card reach end th round lose point city space away home end game marker player s color place city board collect player visit city count point round proceed stage round consist drawing tile show differ type transport raft combination face face tile player doesn t like tile face draw blind face tile hope need transport tile need match transportation card hand use effectively player total tile turn place tile road run elf city transport tile place road player use player tile travel match card hand frequently cause readjustment plan travel route player tile allow far short think player play tile help hinder play slow mode transport player perceive path mode transport certain terrain travel quickly slowly list transportation card number terrain symbol number terrain symbol equal matching card play give tile give terrain example magic cloud tile place mountain magic cloud card travel mountain symbol card mean magic cloud fast mountain tile place road forest terrain require magic cloud card travel route forest symbol card mean magic cloud slow forest magic cloud travel desert terrain desert symbol card mode transport different raft river lake need tile raft slow upstream raft card need fast downstream card need small lake require raft card travel large lake require card travel player unused transport counter transportation card round second round begin player finish place transportation tile round player play card move elf boot board collect token city visit transport tile route player matching transportation card caravan play transportation card hand bit player trouble tile place transportation tile round counter mean order travel path additional card transport type play card caravan victory end round player visit city winner game end round home city reveal player subtract point city away home subtract collect city token person high score win
11;Bohnanza;"Bohnanza is the first in the Bohnanza family of games and has been published in several different editions, including a 2023 version with flowers.&#10;&#10;This entry lists a few different major card sets for Bohnanza: the base game for 3-5 players, the expanded game with the same name for 2-7 players (that is, first expansion included), and Bohnanza Pocket.&#10;&#10;In the game, you plant, then harvest bean cards in order to earn coins. Each player starts with a hand of random bean cards, and each card has a number on it corresponding to the number of that type of beans in the deck. Unlike in most other card games, you can't rearrange the order of cards in hand, so you must use them in the order that you've picked them up from the deck &mdash; unless you can trade them to other players, which is the heart of the game.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you must plant the first one or two cards in your hand into the &quot;fields&quot; in front of you. Each field can hold only one type of bean, so if you must plant a type of bean that's not in one of your fields, then you must harvest a field to make room for the new arrival. This usually isn't good! Next, you reveal two cards from the deck, and you can then trade these cards as well as any card in your hand for cards from other players. You can even make future promises for cards received right now! After all the trading is complete &mdash; and all trades on a turn must involve the active player &mdash; then you end your turn by drawing cards from the deck and placing them at the back of your hand.&#10;&#10;When you harvest beans, you receive coins based on the number of bean cards in that field and the &quot;beanometer&quot; for that particular type of bean. Flip over 1-4 cards from that field to transform them into coins, then place the remainder of the cards in the discard pile. When the deck runs out, shuffle the discards, playing through the deck two more times. At the end of the game, everyone can harvest their fields, then whoever has earned the most coins wins.&#10;&#10;The original German edition supports 3-5 players. The English version from Rio Grande Games comes with the first edition of the first German expansion included in a slightly oversized box. One difference in the contents, however, is that bean #22's Weinbrandbohne (Brandy Bean) was replaced by the Wachsbohne, or Wax Bean. This edition includes rules for up to seven players, like the Erweiterungs-Set, but also adapts the two-player rules of Al Cabohne in order to allow two people to play Bohnanza.&#10;&#10;";1997;7.06976;1.6677;bohnanza bohnanza family game publish different edition include version flower entry list different major card set bohnanza base game player expand game player expansion include bohnanza pocket game plant harvest bean card order earn coin player start hand random bean card card number correspond number type bean deck unlike card game t rearrange order card hand use order ve pick deck mdash trade player heart game turn plant card hand quot field quot field hold type bean plant type bean s field harvest field room new arrival usually isn t good reveal card deck trade card card hand card player future promise card receive right trading complete mdash trade turn involve active player mdash end turn draw card deck place hand harvest bean receive coin base number bean card field quot beanometer quot particular type bean flip card field transform coin place remainder card discard pile deck run shuffle discard play deck time end game harvest field earn coin win original german edition support player english version rio grande game come edition german expansion include slightly oversized box difference content bean s weinbrandbohne brandy bean replace wachsbohne wax bean edition include rule seven player like erweiterung set adapt player rule al cabohne order allow people play bohnanza
12;Ra;"Ra is an auction and set-collection game with an Ancient Egyptian theme.  Each turn players are able to purchase lots of tiles with their bidding tiles (suns).  Once a player has used up his or her suns, the other players continue until they do likewise, which may set up a situation with a single uncontested player bidding on tiles before the end of the round occurs.  Tension builds because the round may end before all players have had a chance to win their three lots for the epoch.  The various tiles either give immediate points, prevent negative points for not having certain types at the end of the round (epoch), or give points after the final round.  The game lasts for three &quot;epochs&quot; (rounds).  The game is easy to learn.&#10;&#10;From the Box:&#10;The game spans 1500 years of Egyptian history in less than an hour!&#10;The players seek to expand their power and fame and there are many ways to accomplish this: Influencing Pharaohs, Building monuments, Farming on the Nile, Paying homage to the Gods, Advancing the technology and culture of the people.

13;CATAN;"In CATAN (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine which resources the island produces. Players build structures by 'spending' resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) which are represented by the relevant resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore, fields produce wheat, and pastures produce sheep.&#10;&#10;Set-up includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each depicting one of the five resource-producing terrain types--or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. A number disk, the value of which will correspond to the roll of two 6-sided dice, are placed on each terrain tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are placed on intersections and borders of the terrain tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which terrain tiles their last-placed settlement is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of rolling the dice, collecting resource cards based on this dice roll and the position of settlements (or upgraded cities&mdash;think: hotels), turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, possibly playing a development card, or trading resource cards with other players. If the dice roll is a 7, the active player moves the robber to a new terrain tile and steals a resource card from another player who has a settlement adjacent to that tile.&#10;&#10;Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road or the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), s/he announces this and claims the win.&#10;&#10;";1995;7.09402;2.2876;catan settler catan player try dominant force island catan build settlement city road turn dice roll determine resource island produce player build structure spend resource sheep wheat wood brick ore represent relevant resource card land type exception unproductive desert produce specific resource hill produce brick forest produce wood mountain produce ore field produce wheat pasture produce sheep set include randomly place large hexagonal tile depict resource produce terrain type desert honeycomb shape surround water tile contain port exchange number disk value correspond roll sided dice place terrain tile player give settlement think house road stick place intersection border terrain tile player collect hand resource card base terrain tile place settlement adjacent robber pawn place desert tile turn consist roll dice collect resource card base dice roll position settlement upgrade city mdash think hotel turn resource card possible desire improvement trading card port possibly play development card trading resource card player dice roll active player move robber new terrain tile steal resource card player settlement adjacent tile point accumulate build settlement city have long road large army development card gather certain development card simply award victory point player gather point hold secret s announce claim win
14;Basari;"Basari is a game of gem merchants competing in a marketplace&quot;: racing, collecting, trading, and predicting what the other merchants will do.&#10;&#10;To start the game, players receive 12 gemstones (3 each of 4 colors). &#10;Each turn there will be a movement phase and an action phase:&#10;&#10;For movement, everyone simultaneously rolls their die and moves their markers around a track.&#10;&#10;They then choose one of three different actions to perform. The actions are:&#10;- to take a variety of gems from a market stall, &#10;- to immediately score from between 4 and 7 points, or &#10;- to roll and move again and also collect points.&#10;&#10;The action cards are revealed simultaneously. If only 1 player chose a particular action, they simply perform that action. If 2 players chose the same action, they barter back and forth with gemstones. One player will eventually accept the other's offer of gems, and the other will take the action. If 3 or 4 players all chose the same action card, that action is cancelled. Note that in 4-player games, there will always be a conflict in choice of 3 actions, so much more negotiating goes on.&#10;&#10;A new turn begins with everyone rolling their die, moving, then choosing and revealing their action cards. When any merchant piece completes a lap around the board, the round ends and bonus points are awarded based on who has the majority in each gem color and who has completed a lap. After three rounds, the game is over and the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Edel, Stein & Reich&#10;&#10;&#10;";1998;6.74612;1.8478;basari game gem merchant compete marketplace quot racing collect trading predict merchant start game player receive gemstone color turn movement phase action phase movement simultaneously roll die move marker track choose different action perform action variety gem market stall immediately score point roll collect point action card reveal simultaneously player choose particular action simply perform action player choose action barter forth gemstone player eventually accept s offer gem action player choose action card action cancel note player game conflict choice action negotiating go new turn begin roll die move choose reveal action card merchant piece complete lap board round end bonus point award base majority gem color complete lap round game high score win implement edel stein reich
15;Cosmic Encounter;"By request of Fantasy Flight Games, Board Game Geek lists the various editions of Cosmic Encounter in separate entries. Each edition is the same game at its core, but the features, compatible expansions, and production differ among them.

16;MarraCash;"Taking on the roles of shop owners in the Moroccan marketplace, players buy various shops, as color-coded tourists in the form of neat little wooden people in hats start showing up at the entry gate.

17;Button Men;"This game gained a quick following after one of the major gaming conventions of 1999.  It features several characters, represented on actual stickpin buttons, that each have a unique allowance of polyhedral dice.  These dice endow each  character with fairly unique combat abilities.  Players roll the dice against each other and take their opponents' dice as casualties.  The object of the game is take out the most die 'sides' during the combat.  It's quite simple, quite inventive, and deeper than it would seem at first.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.36282;1.52;game gain quick following major gaming convention feature character represent actual stickpin button unique allowance polyhedral dice dice endow character fairly unique combat ability player roll dice opponent dice casualty object game die side combat s simple inventive deep
18;RoboRally;"The robots of the RoboRally automobile factory spend their weekdays toiling at the assembly line. They put in hard hours building high-speed supercars they never get to see in action. But on Saturday nights, the factory becomes a world of mad machines and dangerous schemes as these robots engage in their own epic race.It takes speed, wits, and dirty tricks to become a racing legend! Each player chooses a robot and directs its moves by playing cards. Chaos ensues as all players reveal the cards they've chosen. Players face obstacles like industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyor belts -- but those can also be used to their advantage! Each player aims to make it to each of the checkpoints in numerical order. The first player to reach all of the checkpoints wins. &#10;&#10;In RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.&#10;&#10;In general, players will first fill all of their robot's &quot;registers&quot; with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it!&#10;&#10;Robots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style.&#10;&#10;The game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in 2005.&#10;&#10;UPC 742818050029&#10;&#10;";1994;7.0506;2.4285;robot roborally automobile factory spend weekday toil assembly line hard hour build high speed supercar action saturday night factory world mad machine dangerous scheme robot engage epic race take speed wit dirty trick racing legend player choose robot direct move play card chaos ensue player reveal card ve choose player face obstacle like industrial laser gape pit move conveyor belt advantage player aim checkpoint numerical order player reach checkpoint win roborally player control different robot race dangerous factory floor goal place board navigate robot specific order board combine different way accommodate different player count race long short player s desire general player fill robot s quot register quot facedown movement card happen simultaneously time element involve don t act fast force place card randomly fill rest start register reveal card card high number move resolve movement reveal card example movement card turn degree leave right forward space backward space big variety plan perfect route robot run push course disastrous t reprogram card fix robot fire laser factory element resolve movement robot damage damage certain movement card fixed long change destroy entirely robot claim goal correct order win award point play tournament style game reprint avalon hill hasbro wotc upc
19;Wacky Wacky West;"A long time ago, in a village far, far away, some disturbed townsfolk decided to destroy their entire town in order to rid themselves of an evil menace (it's technically a dog-mouse, but I think it's an idiomatic thing).  Anyway, so the villagers rebuilt all the buildings in the town (including their precious outhouses), but forgot to include city walls, a river, or roads.  To rectify this, players lay tiles with one of these three things onto the board, and any building caught underneath them is automatically eliminated, except for outhouses.  When an outhouse would be destroyed, players take a vote on whether to place that particular section.  Each player is trying to retain the most of one type of building, and once all the pieces have been placed the winner is the person with the highest valued buildings still standing.&#10;&#10;Wacky, Wacky West re-make description:&#10;&#10;Fans of Klaus Teuber will be interested in this remake/redesign of Drunter und Dr&uuml;ber, a 1991 Spiel des Jahres winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;Just south of nowhere, there's the junction of the Mayfair &amp; Rossdorf RR and the Turvy Trunk Line. Springing up from the desert like a tumbleweed lies the eccentric little town of Rossdorf. Like most western towns, Rossdorf has a Land Agent: Guy Dough, the brother of that wicked varmint Black Benny. A shrewd opportunist, Guy's done sold all the town land ('ceptin' the outhouses) four times over! Every acre in town that ain't got an outhouse on it is owned by the miners, the railroads, AND the fort captain. Just about a year ago, miners digging in the shadow of Fort Rossdorf struck the mother lode! But it wasn't gold, and it wasn't silver. No, my friend, it was just a little spring. Not any ordinary spring, though! It was a torrent of that mind-marbling drink the locals call &quot;Wacky Water!&quot; &#10;&#10;&#10;Now that water's done what the sun and the wind couldn't do: it's made those landholders brave enough to take matters into their own hands. Now they'll use whatever means they can to bowl over the competition and lay claim to the only fertile spots left in town! Now the only thing stoppin' 'em is the Town Charter Amendment #5, which states: &quot;no landholder may move, remove, or detonate any outhouse without a majority vote of the Town Citizens...&quot; Now one thing's for sure: something's gonna stink in Rossdorf, purty darn soon.....&#10;&#10;&#10;In Wacky Wacky West you and your fellow townfolk place track tiles, street tiles, and river tiles hoping to destroy your rivals' buildings. Every time someone tries to build over a precious outhouse, the town votes! You try to enlist your supporters (represented by cards) to vote with you to stop or encourage the play of certain tiles-perhaps saving some of your buildings or taking out those of your dastardly opponents.&#10;&#10;";1991;6.27644;1.8204;long time ago village far far away disturb townsfolk decide destroy entire town order rid evil menace s technically dog mouse think s idiomatic thing villager rebuild building town include precious outhouse forget include city wall river road rectify player lie tile thing board building catch underneath automatically eliminate outhouse outhouse destroy player vote place particular section player try retain type building piece place winner person high value building stand wacky wacky west description fan klaus teuber interested remake redesign drunter und dr uuml ber spiel des jahres winner south s junction mayfair amp rossdorf rr turvy trunk line spring desert like tumbleweed lie eccentric little town rossdorf like western town rossdorf land agent guy dough brother wicked varmint black benny shrewd opportunist guy s sell town land ceptin outhouse time acre town ain t get outhouse own miner railroad fort captain year ago miner dig shadow fort rossdorf strike mother lode wasn t gold wasn t silver friend little spring ordinary spring torrent mind marbling drink local quot wacky water quot water s sun wind couldn t s landholder brave matter hand ll use mean bowl competition lie claim fertile spot leave town thing stoppin em town charter amendment state quot landholder remove detonate outhouse majority vote town citizen quot thing s sure s go to stink rossdorf purty darn soon wacky wacky west fellow townfolk place track tile street tile river tile hope destroy rival building time try build precious outhouse town vote try enlist supporter represent card vote stop encourage play certain tile save building take dastardly opponent
20;Full Metal PlanÃ¨te;"In this game of science fiction strip mining, players land on a planet and try and grab as much ore as possible and take off before the game is over.  Each player has tanks, boats, barges, mining equipment and a base ship at his disposal and will have to contend with the weather and the other miners.  The game uses an action point allowance system and thus is dice free.  Each player on his turn has a pool of points that he can divide in a variety of ways, putting all the points into one unit's movement or dividing them among several units.  Each turn is timed so players have to think quickly, and once a move has been made it cannot be retracted.  The game itself is beautifully put together, with a detailed hex grid and real metal miniatures for all of the units.&#10;&#10;Online Play: &#10;&#10;    Full Metal Galaxy&#10;    Full Metal Program&#10;    VASSAL module&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Full Metal Conqu&#195;&#170;te (as a two-player version)&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Full Metal Planete: Plateau Modulaire.&#10;&#10;&#10;Microbadges:&#10; - Full Metal Plan&egrave;te fan  Buy It&#10;&#10;";1988;7.50139;3.1429;game science fiction strip mining player land planet try grab ore possible game player tank boat barge mining equipment base ship disposal contend weather miner game use action point allowance system dice free player turn pool point divide variety way put point unit s movement divide unit turn time player think quickly retract game beautifully detailed hex grid real metal miniature unit online play metal galaxy metal program vassal module implement metal conqu te player version expand metal planete plateau modulaire microbadge metal plan egrave te fan buy

22;Magic Realm;"From the 2nd edition rulebook intro for MAGIC REALM:&#10;&#10;MAGIC REALM is a game of fantasy adventuring, set in a land filled with monsters, fabulous treasures, great warriors, and magicians. The scene is set in the ruins of a mighty kingdom, now inhabited by sparse groups of natives and swarms of monsters. Beneath it all are the rich remnants of a magical civilization, scattered and lost across the map.&#10;To this scene come the adventurers, seekers of riches and fame, to make a name for themselves in this promising field. Swordsman and Dwarf, Magician and Sorceror, the humans and the half-humans come seeking to loot the legendary riches of a lost civilization. Now you can play the part of one of these adventurers, stepping into an unknown Realm of magic and monsters, battles and treasures.&#10;&#10;As a player, you will take on the role of one of the sixteen major characters who are represented in detail in the game. You will control where he goes, what he tries to do, how he handles himself in combat, and much more. In the course of the game, you will run into deadly monsters, tribes of humans ranging from old friends to sworn enemies, and treasures that will enhance your abilities in many ways.&#10;&#10;MAGIC REALM is a complex game designed to recapture the suspense and desperate struggles of fantasy literature. The game creates a small but complete fantasy world, where each game is a new adventure with a new map where everything lies hidden at new locations. The game includes many more playing pieces than are actually used in a single playing. The additional pieces are set up and can appear, depending on the directions in which the characters explore, but many of the treasure troves, treasures, and spells will still be set up, unfound, when the game ends, and many of the monsters and natives might never be met. The result is an extremely unpredictable game full of surprises, a game that plays very differently each time it is played.&#10;The complete game system includes hiking, hiding and searching, fatigue, wounds, rest, trade, hiring natives, and combat between characters, monsters, and natives using a variety of weapons on horseback and afoot, as well as many magical effects.&#10;&#10;Between exploring a new land where the mountains, caves, valleys, and woods change every game, and not knowing what you will find in each place, you will find each game a new and unpredictable adventure, filled with surprises. You will find this like no other board game you have ever played.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 9&#10;&#10;See also the list of articles about Magic Realm in The General.&#10;&#10;";1979;7.29803;4.562;nd edition rulebook intro magic realm magic realm game fantasy adventure set land fill monster fabulous treasure great warrior magician scene set ruin mighty kingdom inhabit sparse group native swarm monster beneath rich remnant magical civilization scatter lose map scene come adventurer seeker rich fame promising field swordsman dwarf magician sorceror human half human come seek loot legendary rich lost civilization play adventurer step unknown realm magic monster battle treasure player role sixteen major character represent detail game control go try handle combat course game run deadly monster tribe human range old friend swear enemy treasure enhance ability way magic realm complex game design recapture suspense desperate struggle fantasy literature game create small complete fantasy world game new adventure new map lie hide new location game include play piece actually single play additional piece set appear depend direction character explore treasure trove treasure spell set unfound game end monster native meet result extremely unpredictable game surprise game play differently time play complete game system include hike hiding search fatigue wound rest trade hire native combat character monster native variety weapon horseback afoot magical effect explore new land mountain cave valley wood change game know find place find game new unpredictable adventure fill surprise find like board game play avalon hill complexity rating list article magic realm general

On this journey, there are battles to be fought against roving bands of brigands, dragons, plague and hunger.  There are bazaars to visit to purchase supplies and assistants for the quest.  There are uncharted territories to get lost in and tombs and ruins to plunder.  And there is a mighty army to be raised before the player can lay siege to the tower and fight either to glorious victory or crushing defeat.&#10;&#10;Dark Tower was technologically impressive when it was released in 1981.  Gameplay was facilitated by a small computer inside the black plastic shell of the tower itself.  Players input their moves on a small membrane keypad each turn and the computer took over from there, doing everything from conducting the progress of battles to keeping track of how much (or little) food was left to feed the players' always hungry warriors.

Players attempt to figure out not simply the spelling but the actual letter structure of the hidden words.&#10;&#10;Players take turns putting one letter segment in a letter box on another player's board; they get a point if the segment belongs to that letter and the other player gets a point if it doesn't.

41;Can't Stop;"In this Sid Sackson classic, players must press their luck with dice and choose combinations tactically to close out three columns. The board has one column for each possible total of two six-sided dice, but the number of spaces in each column varies: the more probable a total, the more spaces in that column and the more rolls it takes to complete. On their turn, a player rolls four dice and arranges them in duos: 1 4 5 6 can become 1+4 and 5+6 for 5 &amp; 11, 1+5 and 4+6 for 6 &amp; 10, or 1+6 and 4+5 for 7 &amp; 9. The player places or advances progress markers in the open column(s) associated with their chosen totals, then chooses whether to roll again or end their turn and replace the progress markers with markers of their color. A player can only advance three different columns in a turn and cannot advance a column which any player has closed out by reaching the end space; if a roll doesn&rsquo;t result in any legal plays, the turn ends with that turn&rsquo;s progress lost.&#10;&#10;A predecessor from 1974, The Great Races, exists as a paper-and-pencil game.&#10;&#10;";1980;6.92626;1.1442;sid sackson classic player press luck dice choose combination tactically close column board column possible total sided dice number space column vary probable total space column roll take complete turn player roll dice arrange duos amp amp amp player place advance progress marker open column s associate choose total choose roll end turn replace progress marker marker color player advance different column turn advance column player close reach end space roll doesn rsquo t result legal play turn end turn rsquo s progress lose predecessor great race exist paper pencil game
42;Tigris & Euphrates;"Regarded by many as Reiner Knizia's masterpiece, Tigris &amp; Euphrates is set in the ancient fertile crescent with players building civilizations through tile placement. Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized. Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board, i.e., external conflicts, with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict. Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts.&#10;&#10;Starting in the Mayfair edition from 2008, Tigris &amp; Euphrates included a double-sided game board and extra components for playing an advanced version of the game. This &quot;ziggurat expansion&quot;, initially released as a separate item in Germany for those who already owned the base game, is a special monument that extends across five spaces of the board. The monument can be built if a player has a cross of five civilization tokens of the same color by discarding those five tokens and replacing them with the ziggurat markers, placing a ziggurat tower upon the middle tile. The five ziggurat markers cannot be destroyed. All rules regarding monuments apply to the ziggurat monument as well. If your king is inside the kingdom of the ziggurat, you will get one victory point in a color of your choice at the end of your turn.&#10;&#10;Some versions of Tigris &amp; Euphrates are listed as being for 2-4 players, while others incorrectly state that they're for 3-4 players. Tigris &amp; Euphrates is part of what is sometimes called Reiner Knizia's tile-laying trilogy.&#10;&#10;";1997;7.70242;3.4957;regard reiner knizia s masterpiece tigris amp euphrate set ancient fertile crescent player build civilization tile placement player give different leader farm trading religion government leader collect victory point category score end game number point weak category encourage player overly specialize conflict arise civilization connect board e external conflict leader type survive conflict leader replace civilization internal conflict start mayfair edition tigris amp euphrate include double sided game board extra component play advanced version game quot ziggurat expansion quot initially release separate item germany own base game special monument extend space board monument build player cross civilization token color discard token replace ziggurat marker place ziggurat tower middle tile ziggurat marker destroy rule monument apply ziggurat monument king inside kingdom ziggurat victory point color choice end turn version tigris amp euphrate list player incorrectly state player tigris amp euphrate call reiner knizia s tile lay trilogy
43;Airlines;"Airlines' theme is exactly as suggested by the title. The game is similar to the Sid Sackson classic, Acquire, in that players are competing to become majority stockholders in several highly-abstracted companies with the player owning the most valuable portfolio at the end being the winner.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player chooses from one of two actions: expand an airline and put stock into his hand, or play stock from his hand. Expanding an airline adds to its route(s) on the board and increases its value but the trick is that when a scoring card shows up (randomly), only played stock counts as a player's holdings.&#10;&#10;";1990;6.57678;2.4242;airlines theme exactly suggest title game similar sid sackson classic acquire player compete majority stockholder highly abstract company player own valuable portfolio end winner turn player choose action expand airline stock hand play stock hand expand airline add route s board increase value trick scoring card show randomly play stock count player s holding
44;David & Goliath;"This game adds a very interesting twist to the standard trick-taking genre.  There are five suits and players must follow suit, if they can.  However, the winner of the trick is the highest card played, regardless of suit.  The winner gets all the cards from the trick, minus the card he won it with.  That card is given to the player that played the lowest card.  After all tricks have been played, the scoring begins.  Players score the face-value of the cards in the suits that they only collected one or two of, and one point per card for suits with more than two.  The player with the most points after a number of hands wins the game.&#10;&#10;";1997;6.49319;1.623;game add interesting twist standard trick take genre suit player follow suit winner trick high card play regardless suit winner get card trick minus card win card give player play low card trick play scoring begin player score face value card suit collect point card suit player point number hand win game
45;Perudo;"Liar's Dice, a.k.a. Bluff, Perudo or Dudo, is a South American dice game in which each player is given five dice and cup to roll and hide them with. Players make successively higher declarations regarding the results of all the dice remaining in the game, e.g. &quot;there are ten sixes&quot;. However, someone can always contest the bid. When that happens, all the dice are revealed and either the bidder or the caller loses dice, depending on who was correct. The last player with dice is the winner.&#10;&#10;As a public domain dice game, there are a number of variants or similar games called Liar's Dice. This includes one that is often played with Poker Dice, and differs from the marketed versions in that players only declare on their own hand's value (as opposed to all dice being in play), using poker-hand values.&#10;&#10;";1800;6.92206;1.252;liar s dice k bluff perudo dudo south american dice game player give dice cup roll hide player successively high declaration result dice remain game e g quot six quot contest bid happen dice reveal bidder caller lose dice depend correct player dice winner public domain dice game number variant similar game call liar s dice include play poker dice differ marketed version player declare hand s value oppose dice play poker hand value
46;Medici;"Another Reiner Knizia standby, this game plays very well with varying numbers of people.  The object is to accrue the most points during three rounds, which you do by spending your points to bid on sets of cards.  Each turn the current player turns up one to three cards for all the players to bid on, with the highest bid taking all cards.  The cards denote a commodity type and quantity/value.  The round ends when each player's ships are full, or the commodity card deck is exhausted.  After each round, points are awarded to each player having the most of a given commodity, and to the one with the most valuable total &quot;cargo load&quot;.&#10;&#10;Part of the Knizia auction trilogy.&#10;One of the Knizia Florentine auction games.&#10;&#10; Related Games: &#10;&#10;&#10;     Medici vs Strozzi (two-player version)&#10;     Strozzi&#10;     Mercator, included in Neue Spiele im alten Rom (ancestor to Medici).&#10;&#10;&#10;";1995;7.18278;2.2212;reiner knizia standby game play vary number people object accrue point round spend point bid set card turn current player turn card player bid high bid take card card denote commodity type quantity value round end player s ship commodity card deck exhaust round point award player have give commodity valuable total quot cargo load quot knizia auction trilogy knizia florentine auction game relate game medici vs strozzi player version strozzi mercator include neue spiele m alten rom ancestor medici
47;Chinatown;"This is a negotiation game in the truest sense of the word. In it, players acquire ownership of sections of city blocks then place tiles, representing businesses, onto the block-sections.  At the end of each turn, each tile you've laid gives you some sort of payout, but completed businesses (formed of three to six connected tiles of the same type) pay quite a bit better.  All these resources are dealt to the players randomly, however, so players must trade to get matching businesses and adjacent locations.&#10;&#10;This game is #2 in the Alea big box series.&#10;&#10;";1999;7.43721;2.2346;negotiation game true sense word player acquire ownership section city block place tile represent business block section end turn tile ve lay give sort payout complete business form connect tile type pay bit well resource deal player randomly player trade match business adjacent location game alea big box series
48;Krieg und Frieden;"Taking on the roles of land-owners in a feudal society, players are charged with running their lands and accruing favor from the bishop by building his cathedral.  Each turn, players use their resources to bid for that year's agenda, and some resources have more or less value in the bid depending on what type of agenda is available.  Then players use their remaining resources to build their lands, sack others' lands, bribe others' knights away from defense, or help to build the bishop's cathedral.  Finally, players harvest new resources for the next turn.  After all the pieces of the cathedral have been built, the game is over with the victory going to the player with the most victory points.  This game was originally released as Charlemagne by Think Games at Essen 1998, and later slightly shortened as Krieg und Frieden.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Charlemagne&#10;&#10;&#10;";1999;6.09079;2.4638;take role land owner feudal society player charge run land accrue favor bishop build cathedral turn player use resource bid year s agenda resource value bid depend type agenda available player use remain resource build land sack land bribe knight away defense help build bishop s cathedral finally player harvest new resource turn piece cathedral build game victory go player victory point game originally release charlemagne think game essen later slightly shorten krieg und frieden implement charlemagne
49;Mamma Mia!;"Designer Uwe Rosenberg has a talent for dreaming up new and inventive card games, and Mamma Mia! is a perfect example of this talent, with players placing pizza ingredients into a combined pool, then trying to time their pizza baking in order to make use of what's available in the kitchen.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with eight different pizza orders to fill, with one of those order cards in hand; each player also starts with a hand of ingredient cards (showing pepperoni, mushroom, pineapple, green pepper or olive). On a turn, a player lays down one or more ingredient cards of a single type into a common stack, then optionally adds a pizza order card to that stack. He then refills his hand by drawing as many cards as he played from either the shared ingredient deck or his own order deck.&#10;&#10;After the draw pile is exhausted, the shared pile of cards is flipped over and sorted by ingredients until an order comes up. If enough ingredient cards are available to fill that order, the owner scores it; if not, the player can make up the difference by playing cards from his hand (and thereby scoring the order) or else return the card to the bottom of his order deck.&#10;&#10;Once all the orders are scored or returned, shuffle the ingredients used in pizzas and start another round of play. After three complete rounds, the player who's filled the most orders wins!&#10;&#10;";1998;6.48076;1.362;designer uwe rosenberg talent dream new inventive card game mamma mia perfect example talent player place pizza ingredient combine pool try time pizza bake order use s available kitchen player start game different pizza order fill order card hand player start hand ingredient card show pepperoni mushroom pineapple green pepper olive turn player lay ingredient card single type common stack optionally add pizza order card stack refill hand draw card play share ingredient deck order deck draw pile exhaust share pile card flip sort ingredient order come ingredient card available fill order owner score player difference play card hand score order return card order deck order score return shuffle ingredient pizza start round play complete round player s fill order win
50;Lost Cities;"Lost Cities is a card game in the Kosmos two-player series. The game originally consisted of a single deck of cards of rank 2&ndash;10 in five different colors with three special &quot;handshakes&quot; (&quot;HS&quot; in scoring examples below) in each suit, but as of 2018 the game now includes six colored suits, with the sixth color being optional for gameplay. A game board is included to organize discarded cards and help players organize their card collections.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the colored suits of cards. On a player's turn, they must first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the color-appropriate discard pile, then draw one card, either from the deck or from the top of a discard pile. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order, but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.&#10;&#10;The game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the deck. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total; one handshake doubles an expedition's value, while two handshakes triples that value and three handshakes quadruple it. Expeditions start at a value of -20, so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least eight cards played into it. A complete game of Lost Cities lasts three matches, with scores for each match being added together.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 1: An expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30. This expedition is worth 10 total points: 30 plus the initial -20.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 2: An expedition has 2 HS, and 4,5,6,7,8,10 for a total of 40. This expedition is worth 80 total points: 40 points for cards, plus the initial -20, &times;3 for the two multipliers, plus the 20-pt bonus for playing 8+ cards.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 3: An expedition has 1 HS, and 4,6,7 for a total of 17. This expedition is worth -6 total points: 17 plus the initial -20, &times;2 for the multiplier.&#10;&#10;";1999;7.24938;1.476;lose city card game kosmos player series game originally consist single deck card rank ndash different color special quot handshakes quot quot hs quot scoring example suit game include colored suit sixth color optional gameplay game board include organize discard card help player organize card collection object game gain point mount profitable archaeological expedition different site represent colored suit card player s turn play card expedition discard color appropriate discard pile draw card deck discard pile card play expedition ascend order need consecutive handshake consider low represent investment expedition play red play red card high future turn long play handshake game continue fashion player alternate turn final card take deck rest card hand discard player score expedition expedition card play score card play expedition worth rank point handshake count multipli final total handshake double expedition s value handshake triple value handshake quadruple expedition start value play point card expedition order profit leave negative value handshake multipli apply point bonus award expedition card play complete game lost city last match score match add score example expedition total expedition worth total point plus initial scoring example expedition hs total expedition worth total point point card plus initial time multiplier plus pt bonus play card score example expedition hs total expedition worth total point plus initial time multipli
51;Ricochet Robots;"Ricochet Robots is less of a game and more of a puzzle, which explains why there's such an odd number of solutions possible. There's a four-piece modular board that forms a large room with walls spread around the board. There are also color-coded targets on boards. Placed on top of the surface are four robots. The idea for each turn/puzzle is to get the like-colored robot to a randomly selected target. The trick is that once a robot starts moving, it will continue to move until a wall or another robot stops it. Therefore, players are seeking a sequence of moves for the robots that will enable them to move the required robot to the target in the fewest moves.&#10;&#10;";1999;7.03449;2.3801;ricochet robot game puzzle explain s odd number solution possible s piece modular board form large room wall spread board color code target board place surface robot idea turn puzzle like colored robot randomly select target trick robot start move continue wall robot stop player seek sequence move robot enable require robot target few move

71;Civilization;"Civilization is a game of skill for 2 to 7 players. It covers the development of ancient civilizations from the invention of agriculture c. 8000 B.C. to the emergence of Rome around the middle of the third century B.C. Each player leads a nation of peoples over a map board of the Eastern Mediterranean and Near East as they attempt to carve a niche for themselves and their culture.&#10;&#10;Although battles and territorial strategy are important, this is not a war game because it is not won by battle or conquest. Instead, the object of play is to gain a level of overall advancement involving cultural, economic, and political factors so that such conflicts that do arise are a result of rivalry and land shortage rather than a desire to eliminate other players. Nomad and farmer, warrior and merchant, artisan and citizen all have an essential part to play in the development of civilization. It is the player who most effectively changes emphasis between these various outlooks who will achieve the best balance and win.&#10;&#10;(from the Introduction to the Avalon Hill edition rulebook)&#10;&#10;This game has a huge following and is widely regarded as one of the best games about ancient civilizations. Each player takes on the role of leader of an ancient civilization, such as the Illyrians or Babylonians. Your task is to guide your people through the ages by expanding your empire and using its proceeds to finance new technological advances, such as Literacy, Metalworking, or Law. The advancements help your civilization better cope with its problems as well as help bring new advancements.&#10;&#10;Civilization is widely thought to be the first game ever to incorporate a &quot;technology tree,&quot; allowing players to gain certain items and abilities only after particular other items were obtained. This influential mechanism has been adopted by countless other board games, card games, and computer games.&#10;&#10;";1980;7.49244;3.6435;civilization game skill player cover development ancient civilization invention agriculture c b c emergence rome middle century b c player lead nation people map board eastern mediterranean near east attempt carve niche culture battle territorial strategy important war game win battle conquest instead object play gain level overall advancement involve cultural economic political factor conflict arise result rivalry land shortage desire eliminate player nomad farmer warrior merchant artisan citizen essential play development civilization player effectively change emphasis outlook achieve good balance win introduction avalon hill edition rulebook game huge following widely regard good game ancient civilization player take role leader ancient civilization illyrian babylonian task guide people age expand empire proceed finance new technological advance literacy metalworking law advancement help civilization well cope problem help bring new advancement civilization widely think game incorporate quot technology tree quot allow player gain certain item ability particular item obtain influential mechanism adopt countless board game card game computer game
73;Show Manager;"The players put together four shows in any order.  To accomplish this, players draft actor cards from a constantly changing queue of cards.  Each card represents actors of varying skills at roles.  Once a player puts together all the needed roles for a show, the value is judged against all the other productions of that type, with points given relative to the other productions.&#10;&#10;This is a Queen Games reprint of the db-Spiele original, Premiere.&#10;&#10;";1996;6.9808;2.0938;player show order accomplish player draft actor card constantly change queue card card represent actor vary skill role player put need role value judge production type point give relative production queen game reprint db spiele original premiere
75;Falling;"This game is from an odd genre, real-time card games.  Each of the players (except the dealer) is a person falling to his death.  The goal is not to live, rather just to be the last one to go splat.  The dealer continues dealing cards to players, eventually giving them 'ground' cards.  But on the way down players can do all kinds of nasty stuff to each other to ensure their relative longevity.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.50586;1.218;game odd genre real time card game player dealer person fall death goal live splat dealer continue deal card player eventually give ground card way player kind nasty stuff ensure relative longevity
77;EastFront: The War in Russia, 1941-45;"EastFront details the conflict between Germany and the Soviet Union during WWII.  Players have to contend with production, supply, command control and whether to try and break the other side's lines.  Several scenarios cover every major point of the war.  The game comes with a fantastic, detailed map of Eastern Europe and Russia printed on cardstock and many wooden blocks for the units.  This is a stand alone game that can also serve as one element of the complete EuroFront series which covers the entire European conflict of WWII.&#10;&#10;This title uses the Columbia Games Block system.  While there are variations in the rule sets, all of the &quot;Front&quot; series of games are based on the block system.  Basically this means that rather than using traditional counters to represent units on the map the game uses wooden blocks that stand upright with unit details only shown on one side.  This accomplishes two things:  First it provides an easy way of producing a &quot;fog of war&quot; because your opponent cannot tell, save through good memory or deduction, what type of unit a specific piece is or its current strength.  Second, having the blocks stand on end allows the possibility of rotating a block so the current strength is the top number.  Although most war games have some type of mechanism that allows units to take losses in steps of their overall strength, counters normally have at most two steps because they only have two sides.  Blocks, however, have four so you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide.&#10;&#10;With the use of blocks, Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding complex layers of bookkeeping, allowing interesting and relatively short sessions of play.&#10;&#10;";1991;7.67256;3.6;eastfront detail conflict germany soviet union wwii player contend production supply command control try break s line scenario cover major point war game come fantastic detailed map eastern europe russia print cardstock wooden block unit stand game serve element complete eurofront series cover entire european conflict wwii title use columbia games block system variation rule set quot quot series game base block system basically mean traditional counter represent unit map game use wooden block stand upright unit detail show accomplish thing provide easy way produce quot fog war quot opponent tell save good memory deduction type unit specific piece current strength second have block stand end allow possibility rotate block current strength number war game type mechanism allow unit loss step overall strength counter normally step side block easily track twice detail war game provide use block columbia provide way add good deal depth war game add complex layer bookkeeping allow interesting relatively short session play

83;Sam Grant: The Civil War in the West 1862-1864;"Sam Grant covers the western theater of the American Civil War around the Mississippi area from 1862-1864.  It comes with a beautiful card-stock map from Vicksburg to Cincinnati and heaps of wooden blocks for the North and South.  The game utilizes both a strategic layer of the conflict but also provides a slightly more tactical layer of combat with additional battle maps that allow for center, and flank positions of specific units.  The game can be combined with Bobby Lee so that both theaters of the Civil War can be played out at the same time.&#10;&#10;This title uses Columbia Games Block system.

87;Victory: World War II;"Victory: World War II, originally released as Victory: The Blocks of War, is a Block game published in 1998 by Columbia Games.  It is a generic war game played on modular maps with World War II units.  The game uses a stripped down Front system, with the whole command control element removed and simplified movement and unit production.  Block sets for blue and red players and maps 1 to 4 are included in the base game.&#10;&#10;There are many supplements available, including basic block sets for four additional colors (black, orange, green, and gray), ten-unit elite sets for each color, maps with various terrain, and a logistics expansion which provides a twist on production and adds other strategic elements to the game.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Victory: The Blocks of War &#226;&#128;&#147; Additional Blocksets&#10;    Victory: The Blocks of War &#226;&#128;&#147; Elite Blocksets&#10;    Victory: The Blocks of War &#226;&#128;&#147; Extra Maps&#10;    Victory: The Blocks of War &#226;&#128;&#147; Logistics Set&#10;&#10;&#10;Victory FAQ based on info in the rules forum here and elsewhere.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;    Victory: World War II &#226;&#128;&#147; Second Edition published in 2019.

91;Paths of Glory;"(from GMT Games' website:)&#10;&#10;They called it the Great War. In over four years of titanic struggle, the ancient Europe of Kings and Emperors tore itself to pieces, giving birth to our own violent modern age. The bloody battles fought in the trenches of the Western Front, the icy plains of Poland, the mountains of the Balkans, and the deserts of Arabia, shaped the world we know today. We are all orphans of the Great War.&#10;&#10;Paths of Glory: The First World War, designed by six-time Charles S. Roberts awards winner, Ted Raicer, allows players to step into the shoes of the monarchs and marshals who triumphed and bungled from 1914 to 1918. As the Central Powers you must use the advantage of interior lines and the fighting skill of the Imperial German Army to win your rightful 'place in the sun.' As the Entente Powers (Allies) you must bring your greater numbers to bear to put an end to German militarism and ensure this is the war 'to end all wars.' Both players will find their generalship and strategic abilities put to the test as Paths of Glory's innovative game systems let you recreate all the dramatic events of World War I.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;     316 full-color die-cut counters:&#10;         176 5/8&rdquo; die cut counters&#10;         140 1/2&rdquo; die cut counters&#10;    &#10;     One 22x34&quot; full-color mapsheet showing most of Europe and the Near East&#10;     110 Strategy Cards&#10;     32-page Rule Book including sample game replay (21 pages of actual rules)&#10;     Two Player Reference Cards &#10;&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Ted Raicer&#10;DEVELOPER: Andy Lewis&#10;ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

Not only is the game innovative, but it also plays fast, usually within just an evening.&#10;&#10;While the game itself has all of the normal expectations of a wargame, with various units, CRT charts and period chrome, at heart the game rests within the card play.  Players are given a hand of cards to play out six sub-phases of a turn.  Each sub-phase allows for the use of a card or a pass with a minimal movement of units.  Each card has four possible uses: operational movement, strategic movement, special events, and replacement points.  The cardplay forces players to constantly make tough decsions as they feel that they need to do a little bit of everything but they can only do one thing at a time.  How you play your cards will decide to a large degree the outcome of the war.&#10;&#10;";1999;8.07738;3.854;gmt game website call great war year titanic struggle ancient europe king emperor tear piece give birth violent modern age bloody battle fight trench western icy plain poland mountain balkan desert arabia shape world know today orphan great war path glory world war design time charles s roberts award winner ted raicer allow player step shoe monarch marshal triumph bungle central power use advantage interior line fight skill imperial german army win rightful place sun entente power ally bring great number bear end german militarism ensure war end war player find generalship strategic ability test path glory s innovative game system let recreate dramatic event world war component color die cut counter rdquo die cut counter rdquo die cut counter x quot color mapsheet show europe near east strategy card page rule book include sample game replay page actual rule player reference card designer ted raicer developer andy lewis art director rodger b macgowan map art mark simonitch cards amp counter art mark simonitch bgg description follow footstep people hannibal rome vs carthage successor battle alexander s empire second edition people path glory utilize similar card drive system game cover wwi outbreak american intervention span europe middle east game innovative play fast usually evening game normal expectation wargame unit crt chart period chrome heart game rest card play player give hand card play sub phase turn sub phase allow use card pass minimal movement unit card possible use operational movement strategic movement special event replacement point cardplay force player constantly tough decsion feel need little bit thing time play card decide large degree outcome war
93;El Grande;"In this award-winning game, players take on the roles of Grandes in medieval Spain.  The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions.  To that end, you draft caballeros (knights) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions.  After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).&#10;&#10;A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards vary from round to round.&#10;&#10;The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had there into the region you secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande and in the region containing the king.&#10;&#10;";1995;7.76386;2.9438;award win game player role grande medieval spain king s power flag powerful lord vie control region end draft caballero knight court subsequently board help seize control region round region score ninth round player point winner round select power card determine turn order number caballero province general supply court personal supply turn consist select action card allow variation rule additional scoring opportunity addition determine caballero court region board castillo secretive tower normally place caballero region adjacent contain king hard fast rule el grande king s region action card available round allow king new region action card vary round round goal caballero majority region castillo possible scoring round follow scoring castillo place cube region secretly indicate region dial region score individually accord table print region point bonus award have sole majority region contain grande region contain king

97;Conquest of the Empire;"Conquest of the Empire is part of Milton Bradley&#039;s Gamemaster series.  It is set during the Roman Empire and depicts the struggle around the Mediterranean as rival factions attempt to take control of the empire.  Each player plays one of these factions and receives a Caesar figure, several general figures, and ships of a specific color.  Along with these leaders, players utilize a pool of generic units composed of infantry, cavalry, and catapults.  All game pieces are plastic figures.&#10;&#10;Players attempt to conquer their neighbors and build up cities and fortifications to increase production of wealth.  Players also may build road networks that allow for faster movement, by all armies.  Along the way players have to contend with rising inflation which makes military units more and more expensive.  Eventually through elimination one player pulls ahead for the win.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Eagle Games&#039;s Conquest of the Empire (2005)&#10;&#10;&#10;";1984;6.2972;2.5294;conquest empire milton bradley s gamemaster series set roman empire depict struggle mediterranean rival faction attempt control empire player play faction receive caesar figure general figure ship specific color leader player utilize pool generic unit compose infantry cavalry catapult game piece plastic figure player attempt conquer neighbor build city fortification increase production wealth player build road network allow fast movement army way player contend rise inflation make military unit expensive eventually elimination player pull ahead win implement eagle games s conquest empire
99;Fortress America;"Fortress America, originally part of Milton Bradley's Gamemaster series, depicts an alternate near-future in which all of the world attacks and invades the continental United States. From the west arrives hordes of Asian foes; from the south arrives a union of South American countries through Mexico, and from the east lands come legions of Soviets who have taken over all of Europe. America besieged has to rely on the remaining ground and air forces left in the country along with partisan uprisings to defend mom's apple pie.&#10;&#10;Up to four players can play Fortress America, one player being the U.S. and up to three others controlling the invading units from a particular direction. Being a near future scenario, the units in the game include conventional infantry, APCs, hovertanks, helicopters, bombers, US partisan units, and special &quot;Star Wars&quot; laser relay systems that fire from space.&#10;&#10;The game emphasizes combined arms in that players receive a bonus if infantry, mechanized, and air power are all used in a conflict. For the invading countries, all the units they receive for the game are given at the start so they must manage them wisely. The U.S., however, starts with a skeleton defense and builds up throughout the game through a random deck of cards. Further, the U.S. slowly builds up its Star Wars system, so the longer the invaders are delayed, the more powerful the U.S. becomes both conventionally and through its defense system.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Fortress America (2012)&#10;&#10;&#10;";1986;6.72174;2.6305;fortress america originally milton bradley s gamemaster series depict alternate near future world attack invade continental united states west arrive horde asian foe south arrive union south american country mexico east land come legion soviet take europe america besiege rely remain ground air force leave country partisan uprising defend mom s apple pie player play fortress america player u s control invade unit particular direction near future scenario unit game include conventional infantry apc hovertank helicopter bomber partisan unit special quot star war quot laser relay system fire space game emphasize combined arm player receive bonus infantry mechanized air power conflict invade country unit receive game give start manage wisely u s start skeleton defense build game random deck card u s slowly build star war system long invader delay powerful u s conventionally defense system reimplemente fortress america
101;Detroit-Cleveland Grand Prix;"This game is part of a family which includes Top Race, Daytona 500, and Formel 1.  Players are dealt a hand of cards which have movement numbers for one or more of the cars.  When a card is played, the cars are advanced the number of spaces indicated in order from top to bottom.  However, if the track is blocked, then that movement is lost, so the idea is to use the cards that help your opponents (which you'll likely have to play eventually) only when they won't be able to take advantage of the movement.&#10;&#10;";1996;6.77672;1.713;game family include race daytona formel player deal hand card movement number car card play car advance number space indicate order track block movement lose idea use card help opponent ll likely play eventually win t able advantage movement
103;Titan;"This classic game of the Fantasy Monster Slug-a-thon is a standby from the The Avalon Hill Game Co of yore.  The game still has a very devoted following, which is a tribute to the depth of the various strategies and approaches.  The game is divided into two realms, the masterboard and the battleboards.  On the masterboard, legions of mythical creatures roam about trying to recruit bigger and badder monsters and kill opposing legions in the process.  When a combat occurs, the action moves to the corresponding battleboard type corresponding to the area the fight is taking place in.  After lots of dice are tossed, the army that remains standing is returned to the masterboard with the spoils of war: points.&#10;&#10;The points are used to recruit Angels and Archangels and to augment the leader character of the player's army: The Titan.  As the points increase, the Titans become ever more powerful; at game end, the titan is able to kill most other character with a single blow. But be careful: If the Titan dies, the player is out of the game.&#10;&#10;The last Titan standing is the ruler of all, and winner of the game.&#10;&#10;";1980;6.96373;3.4642;classic game fantasy monster slug thon standby avalon hill game co yore game devoted following tribute depth strategy approach game divide realm masterboard battleboard masterboard legion mythical creature roam try recruit big badder monster kill oppose legion process combat occur action move correspond battleboard type correspond area fight take place lot dice toss army remains stand return masterboard spoil war point point recruit angel archangel augment leader character player s army titan point increase titans powerful game end titan able kill character single blow careful titan die player game titan standing ruler winner game
105;Colossal Arena;"Colossal Arena/Titan:The Arena is a strategic card game for 2 to 5 players: you play, not as combatants, but as spectators, cheering and betting on the melee ongoing in a fantasy arena/colosseum in which fantasy creatures are pitted against each other in battle!&#10;&#10;Each round one of the creatures will die. To decide which unlucky soul will be the victim, players put numbered power cards in front of the creatures, with the lowest one going to the graveyard.  The jockeying for position and strategic diplomacy in playing the numbered power cards can be intense - but what makes this game even more interesting is that the players' place bets throughout the game which will sometimes allow them to use a creature's special power in battle!&#10;&#10;The winner at the end of the game is the bettor who's raked in the most winnings - just another day in the life of a fantasy monster gambler.&#10;&#10;Titan: The Arena is actually a reworking of a Reiner Knizia game called Grand National Derby, but The Avalon Hill Game Co's remake was quite significant from a gameplay standpoint.&#10;&#10;The Titan: The Arena printing is often confused with its namesake, Titan.

107;Peaceful Resistance;"This small-publisher game comes with loads of wooden hex-shaped tiles, a hex board, and three pawns.  The object of the game is to move your pawn from one corner of the hex board to the opposite corner.  However, instead of taking your move, you can place a hex tile on the board.  These are used to block your opponent, because while your pawn can always go down any number of hex tiles, it can only step up one level at a time.&#10;&#10;";1995;5.72353;1.0;small publisher game come load wooden hex shape tile hex board pawn object game pawn corner hex board opposite corner instead take place hex tile board block opponent pawn number hex tile step level time
109;Wettstreit der Baumeister;"Jean du Po&#195;&#171;l put this game out on the market for about a year before the game's name was changed to Wettstreit der Baumeister in 1998.&#10;&#10;This translates to &quot;Contest of the Architects&quot;. The game has a beautiful assortment of large, thick tiles to represent the cities. Players bid on a single building tile every turn, with half the proceeds going to the auctioning player. When a player is ready to start construction of his city, the tiles are laid out in order with the single restriction that not two touching tiles are the same type. The building types are city halls, churches, towers, and gates. When the one of the two draw piles is exhausted, the cities are judged for symmetry, with the highest scoring city winning.&#10;&#10;Rules apply to either game:&#10;&#10;Within two decks of 20 cards are contained the City Wall, Towers and Gates, Churches, City Halls, etc. During play, one of the decks lies face up, the other face down. There are three parts to each player's turn. First, the player rolls a die in an attempt to better his finances (1 to 5 on the die; the sixth side gives a sabotage-counter instead). Second, he alone may look at the top hidden card before he makes an offer on either of the two top cards from the two decks. The other players then bid on the two cards. If the player (the Auctioneer) makes the highest bid, he may take the card and pay the bank. If, on the other hand, one of the other players buys the card, that player pays half the money to the bank and half to the Auctioneer. Third, a player may either build (lay down another card on his city) or sabotage a City Card of another player. The player receiving the sabotage must then pay the value of the card or remove it.&#10;&#10;The game ends when either of the decks is depleted.&#10;&#10;";1994;6.11169;1.9643;jean du po l game market year game s change wettstreit der baumeister translate quot contest architect quot game beautiful assortment large thick tile represent city player bid single building tile turn half proceed go auction player player ready start construction city tile lay order single restriction touching tile type building type city hall church tower gate draw pile exhaust city judge symmetry high scoring city win rule apply game deck card contain city wall tower gate church city hall etc play deck lie face face part player s turn player roll die attempt better finance die sixth give sabotage counter instead second look hide card make offer card deck player bid card player auctioneer make high bid card pay bank hand player buy card player pay half money bank half auctioneer player build lie card city sabotage city card player player receive sabotage pay value card remove game end deck deplete
111;RheinlÃ¤nder;"This Reiner Knizia game, produced by Hasbro&#039;s European division, casts players in the roles of dukes who are trying to establish duchies along the banks of the Rhine River.  Players hold a hand of cards that correspond to numbered plots on each bank, and they place knights in open plots for which they hold the corresponding cards.  After establishing duchies, players attempt to expand them to include more plots of land, as well as buildings - such as castles, cathedrals, and cities. These buildings both add to the value of a duchy and provide their owners with advantages during game play.  Combined with a uniquely Knizia-style scoring system, this game has some very interesting dynamics.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.6552;2.3139;reiner knizia game produce hasbro s european division cast player role duke try establish duchy bank rhine river player hold hand card correspond numbered plot bank place knight open plot hold correspond card establish duchy player attempt expand include plot land building castle cathedral city building add value duchy provide owner advantage game play combine uniquely knizia style scoring system game interesting dynamic
113;Plotters, Inc.;"Plotters, Inc., first released as Mit List und T&uuml;cke (&quot;With Cunning and Treachery&quot;), is a trick-taking game with quite a few twists. The deck consists of cards in four suits, and the deck is adjusted based on the player count so that everyone receives a hand of 14 cards to begin a round. At the start of a trick, the lead player plays any card, setting trump for that trick. Each other player plays any card that they like &mdash; except that once three colors of cards have been played, the fourth color cannot be played. Whoever plays the highest trump card wins the trick and collects two of the cards played (or three cards in a game with five or six players), placing these cards in front of them. Whoever plays the lowest non-trump card collects the remaining cards; this player leads to the next trick.&#10;&#10;Once a player has cards of all four colors in front of them, they must choose two colors and leave cards of this color face up, placing all other cards face down. As they collect more cards, they place them face up or face down based on their colors. The round ends after 14 tricks or when a player would be forced to play a card of the fourth color to a trick; in this latter case, the round ends immediately. Each player then scores the cards they've collected. For their two face-up colors, they multiply these numbers together; they then divide this product by the number of cards that they placed face down, rounding this number down. For example, if you have 6 yellow cards, 4 red cards, and 2 blue cards, then you have (6 &bull; 4)/2 = 12 points. If you collect cards of only one color, then you score 0 points!&#10;&#10;Play as many rounds as the number of players.

115;I'm the Boss!;"The six Investor cards are shuffled and one is dealt face up to each player. Any Investor cards not dealt to the players are set aside for now. The Influence Card deck is shuffled and each player is dealt five cards face down. The player whose Investor is first in alphabetical order goes first. The player to the starting player&rsquo;s right places the Dollar marker on any space on the game board.&#10;&#10;Each space on the game board represents a potential deal which Investors have to approve the deal and the number of dividends to be paid to those investors.&#10;&#10;On one&rsquo;s turn, a player can open negotiations on the deal where the Dollar marker rests or roll the six-sided die. If the player rolls the die, the Dollar marker is advanced clockwise around the game board counting the available deals as spaces. Once the Dollar marker rests, the player may try to negotiate that deal or draw three Influence cards. If by drawing cards, the player&rsquo;s hand exceeds twelve the player chooses which cards to discard to the limit.&#10;&#10;Should a player choose to make the deal, the player negotiates with the player or players representing the Investors how to divide the money at stake. The amount is number of dividends written on the space multiplied by value of the shares written on the deal tile. Any or all of the players may use their Influence cards to affect the outcome of the deal:&#10;&#10;&bull;    Clan cards may act in place of Investors whether the Investors are in play or not.&#10;&bull;    Travel cards put Investors out of play for the negotiations. Some are specific for a given Investor; some are wild to be played on any Investor.&#10;&bull;    Recruitment cards can only be played in sets of three to steal another player&rsquo;s Investor and make it your own.&#10;&bull;    Boss cards give the player control of the negotiations.&#10;&bull;    Stop cards immediately stop the effects of Travel, Recruitment, and Boss Influence cards.&#10;&#10;The players are paid from the bank when a deal has been struck. The game board space is covered with the Deal tile (effectively closing the space from further game play), the Dollar marker is moved to the next open space, and play continues with next player.&#10;&#10;Once nine deals have been made, a die is rolled after each subsequent deal to determine whether the game ends (with the odds increasing each time).

117;Ta YÃ¼;"In Ta Y&uuml;, a game of connections, one side tries to extend from the starting tile in the center to reach the western and eastern edges of the board while the opposing side tries to reach the northern and southern edges.  On your turn you simply draw a tile and decide where to place it, extending the network of tiles already on the board.&#10;&#10;Several refinements make this simple proposition into an engrossing game.  First, each tile is 3x1 (to be played on a 19x19 board) and has exactly three outlets (potential connection points). Second, your score is not simply the number of spots you've reached on one edge added to the number of spots you've reached on the other, but is the product of those two numbers.  So you can't just concentrate on one side and ignore the other, because zero times anything is still zero.  Third, on each side of the board there are three special points which score double if reached, adding a dab of focus to the choices.&#10;&#10;Interestingly, you need to play both offense and defense and will often have to decide to which use to put a particular tile.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.94776;2.0662;ta y uuml game connection try extend start tile center reach western eastern edge board oppose try reach northern southern edge turn simply draw tile decide place extend network tile board refinement simple proposition engrossing game tile x play x board exactly outlet potential connection point second score simply number spot ve reach edge add number spot ve reach product number t concentrate ignore zero time zero board special point score double reach add dab focus choice interestingly need play offense defense decide use particular tile
119;Cosmolancer;"Auf Heller und Pfennig takes participants to a medieval marketplace. Each turn, players place tiles onto the grid board that modify (either positively or negatively) the amount of money to be made by the shops that share that tile's row or column. Three times the board is filled with tiles and shop money is earned, after which the player with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;In Kingdoms, the first English-language version of Auf Heller und Pfennig, players try to collect the most gold by establishing castles in the richest regions of the realm while avoiding hazards like dragons, swamps, and trolls. The 2011 edition includes detailed plastic castles, a streamlined rulebook, and the addition of a wizard tile &mdash; one that increases the rank of adjacent castles, multiplying their scores &mdash; previously available only at game conventions.&#10;&#10;As of 2024, Cosmolancer is the newest version of this design, with players taking the role of freelance photographers...in space! As in the other versions, the game lasts three rounds, and to start a round, each player draws a random tile and keeps it secret. On a turn, you either:&#10;&#10;&bull; Draw a tile and place it in an empty space on the 6x5 grid.&#10;&bull; Place the tile in your hand.&#10;&bull; Place one of your tokens, which are numbered 1-4, in an empty space.&#10;&#10;When all of the spaces are filled, you score each of your tokens, multiplying the number on the token by the sum of the tiles in its row and column, with some special tiles nullifying positive values or splitting a row into two segments. You retrieve all of your 1 tokens, but the others are now out of play.

121;Dune;"Set thousands of years in the future, Dune the board game is based on the Frank Herbert novels about an arid planet at the heart of the human space empire's political machinations.&#10;&#10;Designed by the creators at Eon of Cosmic Encounter fame, some contend that the game can best be described as Cosmic Encounter set within the Dune universe, but the two games bear little in common in the actual mechanisms or goals; they're just both set in space. Like Cosmic Encounter, it is a game that generates player interaction through negotiation and bluffing.&#10;&#10;Players each take the role of one of the factions attempting to control Dune. Each faction has special powers that overlook certain rules in the game. Each turn players move about the map attempting to pick up valuable spice while dealing with giant sandworms, deadly storms, and other players' military forces. A delicate political balance is formed amongst the factions to prevent any one side from becoming too strong. When a challenge is made in a territory, combat takes the form of hidden bids with additional treachery cards to further the uncertainty.&#10;&#10;The game concludes when one faction (or two allied factions) is able to control a certain number of strongholds on the planet.&#10;&#10;Note that the Descartes edition of Dune includes the Duel Expansion and Spice Harvest Expansion, the Landsraad variant from Avalon Hill's General magazine, and additional character disks not provided by AH.&#10;&#10;";1979;7.58602;3.4498;set thousand year future dune board game base frank herbert novel arid planet heart human space empire s political machination design creator eon cosmic encounter fame contend game well describe cosmic encounter set dune universe game bear little common actual mechanism goal set space like cosmic encounter game generate player interaction negotiation bluffing player role faction attempt control dune faction special power overlook certain rule game turn player map attempt pick valuable spice deal giant sandworm deadly storm player military force delicate political balance form faction prevent strong challenge territory combat take form hidden bid additional treachery card uncertainty game conclude faction allied faction able control certain number stronghold planet note descartes edition dune include duel expansion spice harvest expansion landsraad variant avalon hill s general magazine additional character disk provide ah

Four cards from the deck are placed face up to its left and to its right.&#10;&#10;In a round, each player chooses a bid of one or more cards from their hand, then everyone reveals their bid simultaneously. Whoever bid the highest sum takes the four cards to the left or right of the deck or another player's bid, adds these cards to their hand, then places their bid next to the deck or in front of the player whose bid they took. (Alternatively, the player can return their bid to hand.) Then the next player with the highest bid resolves their bid similarly. Once all players have resolved their bids, draw cards from the deck to refill the lots to the left and right of the deck to four cards. When the deck runs out, play one final round, then score your cards in hand.&#10;&#10;If you have 200 or more in a single currency, score that many points.

139;Hoax;"The basic idea in Hoax is to pretend to be somebody you are not while working towards the goal of figuring out who other people are. Each player is assigned one of six different characters -- each with its own unique abilities -- but can pretend to be any character and use its corresponding powers.  Abilities are used to acquire 3 different types of goods, which can be spent to get clues to opponents' identities.

141;Andromeda;"Each player controls bases/stations (in the form of little wooden cubes) which they use to attempt to build Economic Centers on the moons of seven planets in an alien planetary system.  After moving their tokens on to a planet, players use an interesting little device ('planet ring'/'wormhole' - functions like a blind draw bag) to select one of the tokens on the planet.  Players take actions by collecting sets of cards which correspond to the the various planets.  The game also features a unique trading system which facilitates the card collecting. Careful card trading and calculating risk of establishing economic centers, and some variants, mitigate some of the luck factor.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;Setup: 9 cards/player.

Start player must trade; recipient either accepts cards into hand, or leaves out. Clockwise from Start Player, next player with cards still in front of them either makes a trade or takes their cards back. Continue till 0-1 people left with cards in front; they take them back to hand.&#10;&#10;Action Step: Start player takes 3 actions, then others take 2 each. Actions can be:&#10;- discard 2 cards, then draw 2&#10;- turn in set of 3-7 cards to send half (rounding down) as many cubes from earth to a planet&#10;- turn in set of 3-7 cards to advance Ship Level, Tech Level, or to make attempt to establish colony on a planet matching cards played: place cubes on that planet into the cosmic ashtray, randomize, then reveal up to as many cubes as attempts made. If reveal your cube, place it on a station; turn over.

145;Metropolis;"One of game designer Sid Sackson&#039;s greatest contributions to the negotiation genre, this game has players  trying to construct the best buildings in a rapidly growing city.  The map is a collection of city blocks broken into smaller properties.  Each turn, players choose one property and try to work out deal for placing a new structure on the board.  The value of each building is determined by the type of buildings in the same block, so both a school and an apartment building receive bonuses for existing together.&#10;&#10;";1984;6.36169;2.2353;game designer sid sackson s great contribution negotiation genre game player try construct good building rapidly grow city map collection city block break small property turn player choose property try work deal place new structure board value building determine type building block school apartment building receive bonus exist

151;Piratenbillard;"This interesting dexterity game is played on a table-like board that is a wooden lattice with a piece of linen stretched over the bottom.  Little colored balls are placed in the resulting holes, and then players use long wooden mallets to strike the bottom of the table.  When a ball is hit correctly, it will pop out of the space it's in and land in another space closer to the opposite side of the board.  Landing on another player's ball lets you capture it, but if your ball lands off the board, it's out of the game.&#10;&#10;";1989;6.55146;1.2414;interesting dexterity game play table like board wooden lattice piece linen stretch little colored ball place result hole player use long wooden mallet strike table ball hit correctly pop space s land space close opposite board land player s ball let capture ball land board s game
153;Take 5!;"Relying heavily on his previous effort, 6 Nimmt!, Wolfgang Kramer has transformed it into a more strategic game.  The deck is numbered from 1 to 98, with some of the cards having green bullheads and others having red bullheads.  In this game greens are positive points and reds are negative points.  As in 6 Nimmt!, players are constructing sets of cards, with the fifth card in a set taking the whole thing.  This time, however, players take their turns sequentially and can play one to three cards from their hands.&#10;&#10;In a confusing twist, the Dutch edition of 6 Nimmt! is called Take 5! but is the progenitor game, not this game.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.55984;1.474;rely heavily previous effort nimmt wolfgang kramer transform strategic game deck number card have green bullhead have red bullhead game green positive point red negative point nimmt player construct set card fifth card set take thing time player turn sequentially play card hand confusing twist dutch edition nimmt call progenitor game game
155;Was sticht?;"This is a two-trump, trick-taking card game, with several twists.  At the beginning of the game, players draft tasks they intend to complete in order to win the game.  (Tasks include things like &quot;Take no tricks&quot;, &quot;Take 1 Trick&quot;, or &quot;Take No Red Cards&quot;.)  Then, all of the cards are dealt out in front of the players before each hand.  Row by row, the players draft cards, and the dealer declares who would have won each row's trick, if it had been played that way.  Players use this information to deduce what the trump number and suit are.  After all the cards are drafted, each player - except the dealer - selects one of the task tiles she drafted, which will be her mission for the hand.  The dealer is stuck trying to uniquely accomplish someone else's task for the round - but at least doesn't have to preselect which person's goal he is trying to &quot;steal&quot;.  The hand is then played in the traditional fashion, with each player trying to take tricks or not, based on the goal she selected.  The first player to complete five tasks wins the game.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    M&#195;&#188; and Lots More&#10;&#10;&#10;";1993;6.98274;2.377;trump trick take card game twist beginning game player draft task intend complete order win game task include thing like quot trick quot quot trick quot quot red card quot card deal player hand row row player draft card dealer declare win row s trick play way player use information deduce trump number suit card draft player dealer select task tile draft mission hand dealer stick try uniquely accomplish s task round doesn t preselect person s goal try quot steal quot hand play traditional fashion player try trick base goal select player complete task win game implement m lot

171;Chess;"Chess is a two-player, abstract strategy board game that represents medieval warfare on an 8x8 board with alternating light and dark squares. Opposing pieces, traditionally designated White and Black, are initially lined up on either side of the board. Each type of piece has a unique form of movement and capturing occurs when a piece, via its movement, occupies the square of an opposing piece. Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture, attack, defend, or develop their positions. Chess games can end in checkmate (when the king cannot escape from the opponent's pieces), resignation (when one player recognizes that defeat is inevitable and ends the game), or one of several types of draws.&#10;&#10;Chess is one of the most popular games in the world, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. Between two highly skilled players, chess can be a beautiful thing to watch, and a game can provide great entertainment even for novices. The 2020 Netflix series, The Queen's Gambit was enjoyed by both chess players and non-players alike. There is also a large literature of books and periodicals about chess, typically featuring games and commentary by chess masters. Chess is so well known and highly regarded that it is often used as a metaphor in journalism, poetry, fiction, and film.&#10;&#10;Chess has its origins in the Indian game Chaturanga, which became Shatranj when introduced to the Persians. The current form of the game emerged in the second half of the 15th century when the Persians brought Shatranj to Southern Europe. The tradition of organized competitive chess began in the 16th century. The first official World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886. Chess is also a recognized sport of the International Olympic Committee.&#10;&#10;";1475;7.22608;3.6538;chess player abstract strategy board game represent medieval warfare x board alternate light dark square oppose piece traditionally designate white black initially line board type piece unique form movement capturing occur piece movement occupy square oppose piece player turn move piece attempt capture attack defend develop position chess game end checkmate king escape opponent s piece resignation player recognize defeat inevitable end game type draw chess popular game world play million people worldwide home club online correspondence tournament highly skilled player chess beautiful thing watch game provide great entertainment novice netflix series queen s gambit enjoy chess player non player alike large literature book periodical chess typically feature game commentary chess master chess known highly regard metaphor journalism poetry fiction film chess origin indian game chaturanga shatranj introduce persian current form game emerge second half th century persian bring shatranj southern europe tradition organized competitive chess begin th century official world chess champion wilhelm steinitz claim title chess recognize sport international olympic committee

175;What the Heck?;"Rarely is a game broken down to its barest elements like this one.  Players are given an equal deck of bidding cards from one to fifteen.  Each turn, a prize tile is randomly selected from a pool.  A prize tile is worth either positive or negative points (from -5 to +10).  Each player is attempting to gather the most positive points from these prizes.  Players secretly select one of their remaining bidding cards and reveal them simultaneously.  For positive prizes, the highest card gets the prize; For negative prizes, the lowest card is stuck with the prize.  However, if two people play the highest (or lowest) card, they cancel each other out and the prize goes to the next in line.

179;Nuba;"The board is a 5 x 6 grid. Each player has ten tokens, numbered 1 - 9 and one 'X'. Players alternate setting their pieces in the two rows nearest them. The lower the number on the token, the better a wrestler that piece is. The higher the number, the better the musician (but that makes that piece a lousy wrestler). The idea is to get your highest possible piece to the opposite side of the board.&#10;&#10;When a piece successfully reaches the opposite side of the board, it is placed in the honorable musician space. It remains there unless another piece (of either player) with a higher value reaches the opposite side, in which case it supplants this piece as the best musician. The game ends when no one can oust the reigning musician (which means no one has a piece left on the board of a higher value). If a player's piece marked with the 'X' reaches the opposite side, the game immediately ends and that player is victorious.&#10;&#10;A variant is given in which all pieces which cross the board are summed to determine the winner, although a player exiting their 'X' still wins immediately.&#10;&#10;The original magazine publication also suggests playing on a 6x6 board with additional '10' and '11' pieces.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.20585;2.0;board x grid player token number x player alternate set piece row near low number token well wrestler piece high number well musician make piece lousy wrestler idea high possible piece opposite board piece successfully reach opposite board place honorable musician space remain piece player high value reach opposite case supplant piece good musician game end oust reign musician mean piece leave board high value player s piece mark x reach opposite game immediately end player victorious variant give piece cross board sum determine winner player exit x win immediately original magazine publication suggest play x board additional piece

183;Stonehenge;"Stonehenge is a two-player game that has druids competing at Stonehenge to be the Master Druid.&#10;&#10;Each player has 8 coloured megaliths (tall wooden blocks) and 9 matching discs (numbered 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,5, &amp; 6). The board is a triangle of 5 dissecting lines, with the corners lopped off, so the lines are 2,3,4,5,4 spaces long. On each side are 5 extra spaces, where players put their megaliths.&#10;&#10;Players take turns putting down a numbered disc on the intersections of the lines on the board. When you have the majority total in any direction, you claim that line by placing your megalith on the end point.

185;Devil Bunny Needs a Ham;"In this wacky Cheapass title, players are Sous Chefs trying to get to the top floor of a skyscraper by scaling the outside.  However the maniacal Devil Bunny is hopping about in a mad lust for blood thinking he'll get a ham by knocking you off.  Yeah, right, whatever.&#10;&#10;The game board is a rectangular grid representing the side of a building, with the starting space at the bottom, and the goal at the top. There is a dotted line near the top that represents a critical height (see below). Furthermore, there are special spaces on the sides of the buildings that represent &quot;fear&quot; that cannot be moved into (As a show of Cheapass Games' signature humor, these fears included &quot;spiders&quot; and &quot;Wesley Snipes.&quot;)&#10;&#10;In the basic game, each player controls two sous-chefs; on each turn, the player rolls two six-sided dice. Any roll other than a 6 can be used to move one or both sous-chefs up the side of the building, either horizontally or on upwards diagonals (a player cannot voluntarily move down the building). If a 6 is rolled, the Devil Bunny token is moved to the highest sous-chef on the board and knocks him off; if there is a sous-chef vertically below the one that was knocked off, the player controlling that one may opt to catch the falling sous-chef, placing the token in the spaces immediately below him. If no player that is able to catch the sous chef offers to help, the chef will crash to the ground. If the chef fell from a height below the marked line on the board, the chef is safe but must restart him climb back from the start. However, if the chef was above this line, the chef is dead, leaving the player with one fewer token to win. The players earn points for the order in which their chefs arrive at the top, and the weighting is such that a player with second and third-place chefs can beat a player with a first-place and a dead (non-scoring) chef.&#10;&#10;Variants include ignoring the effects of the fear spaces (which normally cluster the players into the center columns), and using 3 sous-chef tokens for each player.&#10;&#10;In 2022, Greater Than Games created a boxed edition with upgraded components.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.39836;1.1757;wacky cheapass title player sous chef try floor skyscraper scale outside maniacal devil bunny hop mad lust blood think ll ham knock yeah right game board rectangular grid represent building start space goal dotted line near represent critical height furthermore special space side building represent quot fear quot move cheapass game signature humor fear include quot spider quot quot wesley snipe quot basic game player control sous chef turn player roll sided dice roll sous chef building horizontally upwards diagonal player voluntarily building roll devil bunny token move high sous chef board knock sous chef vertically knock player control opt catch fall sous chef place token space immediately player able catch sous chef offer help chef crash ground chef fall height marked line board chef safe restart climb start chef line chef dead leave player few token win player earn point order chef arrive weighting player second place chef beat player place dead non score chef variant include ignore effect fear space normally cluster player center column sous chef token player great game create boxed edition upgrade component
189;Die Siedler von NÃ¼rnberg;"Based on the well-known Settlers of Catan, this stand-alone game published in commemoration of the anniversary of the founding of the city of N&uuml;rnberg gives players some new twists to the familiar experience.  Unlike standard Settlers, the game layout is not modular.  Instead the board features a split map, half of which has the goods-producing hexes of a conventional Settlers game where settlements will be built and the other half showing a closeup of N&uuml;rnberg where &quot;workshops&quot; will be built (in lieu of promoting settlements to cities as in the original Settlers).  The players also get currency for manufactured goods which in turn they spend on walls and towers to surround the city, which earn prestige points which ultimately count toward victory points.  Probably the most interesting other detail is that instead of rolling dice, a special deck of cards is used to reveal the production number -- and possibly an event -- at the beginning of each player's turn.&#10;&#10;Belongs to the Catan Series.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.90314;2.7792;base know settler catan stand game publish commemoration anniversary founding city n uuml rnberg give player new twist familiar experience unlike standard settler game layout modular instead board feature split map half good produce hex conventional settler game settlement build half show closeup n uuml rnberg quot workshops quot build lieu promote settlement city original settler player currency manufactured good turn spend wall tower surround city earn prestige point ultimately count victory point probably interesting detail instead roll dice special deck card reveal production number possibly event beginning player s turn belong catan series
193;Fill or Bust;"Fill or Bust is all about rolling dice and pressing your luck. On your turn, roll the dice and set aside at least one die that scores you points. If you want, you can roll the remaining dice &ndash; but if none of those dice score for you, you lose all points accumulated that round! Your challenge is further complicated by a deck of cards that determines what goal you might be forced to shoot for during that turn. Some goal cards dangle the prospect of huge bonuses, while others slam the door on you, ending your turn before it starts.&#10;&#10;Other than the deck of cards that push goals on players, Fill or Bust is similar to Farkle.&#10;&#10;";1981;5.79966;1.1489;fill bust roll dice press luck turn roll dice set aside die score point want roll remain dice ndash dice score lose point accumulate round challenge complicate deck card determine goal force shoot turn goal card dangle prospect huge bonus slam door end turn start deck card push goal player fill bust similar farkle
195;NASCAR Champions;"It looks a bit like Daytona 500 with its oversized racetrack gameboard, but it's a much simpler game.  The main thing going on is that you roll the five dice on your turn and pick which three you want to play.  Each die has the five colors for the five cars in the race and one &quot;checkered flag&quot; side which means you draw a card.  The dice are numbered 1 to 5 (that is, each die has one of the five numbers), and the three you pick have to be played in order.  If you draw a card, it might instruct you to move a particular car, or the car in last place, or to spin a car out; or it might make you a &quot;Sponsor&quot; of a car, meaning you could get prize money for a car other than your main car.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.515;1.1;look bit like daytona oversized racetrack gameboard s simple game main thing go roll dice turn pick want play die color car race quot checker flag quot mean draw card dice number die number pick play order draw card instruct particular car car place spin car quot sponsor quot car mean prize money car main car
197;HellRail: Second Perdition;"Based on Dante&#039;s Inferno, HellRail: 2nd Perdition has players creating rail to deliver the souls of the damned to the appropriate circles of Hell.  The card mechanics are clever, as every card can become a load to be delivered, or be used to build rail, move trains, or draw more cards.  Additionally, upon arriving at each circle, players have the choice to call forth that circle's powers, possibly putting a serious crimp in their opponents' efforts.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    HellRail&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented as:&#10;&#10;    FrachtExpress&#10;    HellRail: Third Perdition&#10;&#10;&#10;";1999;6.04218;2.0;base dante s inferno hellrail nd perdition player create rail deliver soul damned appropriate circle hell card mechanic clever card load deliver build rail train draw card additionally arrive circle player choice forth circle s power possibly put crimp opponent effort implement hellrail implement frachtexpress hellrail perdition
199;Manhattan;"In Manhattan, players construct a skyline of skyscrapers over several districts, or city blocks, of Manhattan Island. Ultimately, each player seeks to have built the tallest buildings in the most city blocks of the Island.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players will play a card that illustrates which part of a city block they may place a &quot;floor&quot; on a building. The placement card is unique for each player in that the section they may place in is relative to their seating at the table. The player who has placed the top most floor controls that building. Each round, scores are tallied based on control of each of the neighborhoods.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the player who has scored the most points through area control and tallest buildings wins.&#10;&#10;Note: In the Finnish edition, the districts are named after six great cities of the world: Hong Kong, Sao Paulo, Cairo, Sydney, Frankfurt and Manhattan.&#10;&#10;(Espa&ntilde;ol)&#10;&#10;En Manhattan los jugadores construyen un 'skyline' de rascacielos en distintos distritos o zonas de la isla de Manhattan.
