Before running the notebook, some considerations must be taken into account:

##### Task 1:
- Required dataset: 'boardgames_4122.csv'
- To run the GloVe embedding code, two files are needed: 'glove.6B.100d.txt' and 'glove.6B.300d.txt', which can be found at [GloVe Wikipedia 2014 + Gigaword](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gerwynng/glove-wikipedia-2014-gigaword-5).

##### Task 2:
- Two options to proceed:
  1. Run the complete first task to obtain the whole process inside the pandas dataframe 'games'
  2. Load directly 'boardgames_4122_clean_glove_dual_tone.csv', which contains all the necessary processing to run this second task.
- Load the 'reviews' dataset that can be found in [BoardGameGeek Reviews on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jvanelteren/boardgamegeek-reviews)
