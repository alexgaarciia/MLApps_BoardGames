1;Die Macher;"Die Macher is a game about seven sequential political races in different regions of Germany. Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The 1986 edition featured four parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players. The 1997 edition supports up to five players in the re-united Germany and updated several features of the rules as well.  The 2006 edition also supports up to five players and adds a shorter five-round variant and additional rules updates by the original designer.&#10;&#10;";1986;7.58777;4.3081;3;5;240;14;Economic, Negotiation, Political
2;Dragonmaster;"Dragonmaster is a trick-taking card game based on an older game called Coup d'&#195;&#137;tat. Each player is given a supply of plastic gems, which represent points. Each player will get to be the dealer for five different hands, with slightly different goals for each hand. After all cards have been dealt out, the dealer decides which hand best suits his or her current cards, and the other players are penalized points (in the form of crystals) for taking certain tricks or cards. For instance, if &quot;first&quot; or &quot;last&quot; is called, then a player is penalized for taking the first or last tricks. All players will get a chance to be dealer for five hands, but other players can steal this opportunity by taking all of the tricks during certain hands. At the end, the biggest pile of gems wins the game.&#10;&#10;Jewel contents:&#10;&#10;10 clear (2 extra)&#10;14 green (2 extra)&#10;22 red (2 extra)&#10;22 blue (2 extra)&#10;&#10;";1981;6.66468;1.9643;3;4;30;12;Card Game, Fantasy
3;Samurai;"Samurai is set in medieval Japan. Players compete to gain the favor of three factions: samurai, peasants, and priests, which are represented by helmet, rice paddy, and Buddha figures scattered about the board, which features the islands of Japan. The competition is waged through the use of hexagonal tiles, each of which help curry favor of one of the three factions &mdash; or all three at once! Players can make lightning-quick strikes with horseback ronin and ships or approach their conquests more methodically. As each figure (helmets, rice paddies, and Buddhas) is surrounded, it is awarded to the player who has gained the most favor with the corresponding group.&#10;&#10;Gameplay continues until all the symbols of one type have been removed from the board or four figures have been removed from play due to a tie for influence.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players compare captured symbols of each type, competing for majorities in each of the three types. Ties are not uncommon and are broken based on the number of other, &quot;non-majority&quot; symbols each player has collected.&#10;&#10;The game is part of what is sometimes called the Knizia tile-laying trilogy.&#10;&#10;";1998;7.47596;2.442;2;4;60;10;Abstract Strategy, Medieval
4;Tal der Könige;"When you see the triangular box and the luxurious, large blocks of Tal der K&ouml;nige (German: &quot;Valley of the Kings&quot;), you can tell this game was designed to be beautiful as well as functional.  The object of the game is to build pyramids out of the different colored blocks.  A pyramid scores more points when it's made from a few colors, but it's much harder to consistently outbid the other players for the necessary blocks.  The game is over when the Pharoah's Pyramid in the center is completed, which is built using all the blocks that the players don't use during the course of the game.&#10;&#10;Final round 1990 Hippodice Spieleautorenwettbewerb.&#10;&#10;";1992;6.6154;2.6875;2;4;60;12;Ancient
5;Acquire;"In Acquire, each player strategically invests in businesses, trying to retain a majority of stock.  As the businesses grow with tile placements, they also start merging, giving the majority stockholders of the acquired business sizable bonuses, which can then be used to reinvest into other chains.  All of the investors in the acquired company can then cash in their stocks for current value or trade them 2-for-1 for shares of the newer, larger business.  The game is a race to acquire the greatest wealth.&#10;&#10;History of Acquire: This Sid Sackson classic has taken many different forms over the years depending on the publisher, yet the rules and game play have stayed the same. The 1966 version of the 3M bookshelf edition included rules for a 2-player variant. The original version is part of the 3M Bookshelf Series.&#10;&#10;Many books and websites incorrectly list this as a 1962 publication as the 3M Company used previously copyrighted artwork when they released the game in 1964. 3M actually received the idea for the game of &quot;Vacations&quot; from Sid Sackson in May of 1963 and decided to take his idea and put it into artwork they had developed the year before for a game called &quot;ACQUIRE.&quot; 3M's original game idea for a game called ACQUIRE must not have been very good so they decided to take Sid's idea of Vacations and put it into their concept of ACQUIRE. They released some limited test market games in 8 Midwestern U.S. cities in December of 1963 with a box that had a 1963 copyright. These games had Sid's original rules. When 3M released the mass market games in 1964, they had developed some of Sid's original ideas and changed some rules and game play to match their production desires. They released them with outer boxes that were copyrighted 1962 and inner boxes with rules that were dated 1963.&#10;&#10;December 1963 - Test Market World Map Wood Tile Edition&#10;1964 - Dated 1962/63 wood tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay &amp; stocks with printed backs&#10;1965 - Dated 1962/63 plastic tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay &amp; stocks with printed backs (last edition made with printed backs until 1999)&#10;1966 - Dated 1962/66 plastic tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay &amp; non-wax coated stocks (Only edition with these stocks)&#10;1968 - Dated 1968/66 plastic tiles, clear plastic board with paper underlay (Both 1966 inner box games have a lot of mixed parts)&#10;1971 - Dated 1968/71 plastic tiles, yellow hard plastic board&#10;1975 - 3M sells rights for game of ACQUIRE to the Avalon Hill Company&#10;1976 - Dated 1976 plastic tiles, yellow hard plastic board, redesigned money, no inner box (This edition was also produced in 1977, 79, 81, 82,       &amp; 86)&#10;1989 - Dated 1976 Gray box edition with new box artwork same contents as regular 1976 editions (This edition was also produced in 1992)&#10;1995 - Dated 1995 Large box cardboard edition with chipboard board and tiles, Special Powers Variant Tiles inspired by German editions&#10;1997 - Avalon Hill sells the rights to the game of ACQUIRE to Hasbro&#10;1999 - Dated 1999 Large box with large plastic board and tiles, 3D company buildings, redesigned stocks &amp; money, large info cards&#10;2006 - Hasbro assigns rights for the game of ACQUIRE to their subsidiary, Wizards of the Coast&#10;2006 - Lloyd's (private) Rules of ACQUIRE are made public, two major rule changes that help to bring the balance of the game of ACQUIRE back to the  intentions of Sid Sackson's original ideas.

Although these changes have been criticised for not ultimately improving upon Sackson's original design, they are generally regarded as not being too damaging to it.&#10;2023 - Renegade Game Studio partners with Hasbro, and releases their new version, with Classic Mode or Tycoon Mode &mdash; play with or without tertiary stockholder merger bonus. &#10;2024 - The Renegade 60th Anniversary edition includes a set of plastic weighted poker chips, and Special Powers Variant cards.&#10;&#10;";1964;7.35053;2.4923;2;6;90;12;Economic, Territory Building
6;Mare Mediterraneum;"In the ancient lands along the Mediterranean, players attempt to satisfy their unique victory conditions via trade, war and construction.  This lavishly produced game contains tons of wooden game components and a beautiful roll-out vinyl map.  Players produce a score of different commodities to trade with other cities in the hope of creating enough income to fill their capitals with buildings, produce artwork, and fill warehouses with goods.&#10;&#10;";1989;6.4523;3.0;2;6;240;12;Civilization, Nautical
7;Cathedral;"In Cathedral, each player has a set of pieces of a different color. The pieces are in the shapes of buildings, covering from one to five square units. The first player takes the single neutral Cathedral piece and places it onto the board. Players then alternate placing one of their buildings onto the board until neither player can place another building. Players capture territory by surrounding areas that are occupied by at most one opponent or neutral building. A captured piece is removed and captured territory becomes off-limits to the opponent. The player with the fewest 'square units' of buildings that can't be placed wins.&#10;&#10;";1979;6.54958;1.7887;2;2;20;8;Abstract Strategy, Children's Game, City Building, Territory Building
8;Lords of Creation;"In this interesting offering from Warfrog, players become Gods seeking to dominate a world with their followers.  The first part of the game involves constructing the game board, after which players take turns using cards to determine how many new people should appear and what type of terrain they will inhabit.  All tribes start off as barbarians, but soon the calming effect of civilization settles the marauding bands; although civilized tribes score more, they can no longer attack.  What they can do, though, is civilize other players' followers.  Sure it gives opponents more points, but at least those followers won't come after you!&#10;&#10;";1993;6.05322;2.4;2;5;120;12;Civilization, Fantasy
9;El Caballero;"Although referred to as a sequel to El Grande, El Caballero shares few aspects with its namesake, being a fun but intense brain-burner in which players explore and attempt to control the lands and waterways of the New World.&#10;&#10;The players are following Columbus by exploring the islands he discovered. Players slowly explore the islands &ndash; by picking and placing land tiles that are most favorable to them &ndash; and discover wealth in the form of gold and fish. As they learn about the land and sea areas of this new land, they position their caballeros to try to maintain control of the important regions. Castillos give them a measure of protection from others, and ships allow them to establish trade and to fish for food. Success is measured in the size of land and sea areas they control. Their success is measured twice, and in the end these scores are summed and the winner declared.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.46943;2.9515;2;4;90;13;Exploration
10;Elfenland;"Elfenland is a redesign of the original White Wind game Elfenroads.  The game is set in the mythical world of the elves.  A group of fledgling elves (the players) are charged with visiting as many of the twenty Elfencities as they can over the course of 4 rounds.  To accomplish the task they will use various forms of transportation such as Giant Pigs, Elfcarts, Unicorns, Rafts, Magic Clouds, Trollwagons, and Dragons.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:  Players begin in the Elf capitol, draw one face down movement tile, and are dealt eight transport cards and a secret 'home' city card that they must reach at the end of the 4th round or lose points for each city space away from 'home' they are at the end of the game. Markers of each player's color are placed in each city on the board and are collected when the player visits that city (each counts as 1 point).&#10;  &#10;     The round proceeds in 2 stages.  The first part of the round consists of the drawing of Tiles showing the differing types of transport (except rafts) from a combination of face up and face down tiles (if a player doesn't like the 5 tiles that are face up; they can always draw blind from the face down tiles and hope to get one they need).  These transport tiles need to match the Transportation cards in your hand to use them most effectively.  After each player has a total of 4 tiles they take turns placing a tile on any one of the roads that run between the elf cities.  Only one transport tile may be placed on each road; so players may use other players tiles to travel if they have the matching cards in their hand.  This frequently causes a readjustment of planned travel routes as other players tiles can allow you to move farther or shorter than you had first thought.  Players can play their tiles to help themselves or hinder others by playing a slow mode of transport on another players (perceived) path.&#10;&#10;Each mode of transport has certain terrain it can travel through quickly or slowly, and those that it cannot. These are listed on the top of each transportation card by the number terrain symbols.  The number of terrain symbols equals how many matching cards you must play to move across a given tile in a given terrain.  For example, a Magic Cloud tile placed in a mountain would take one Magic cloud card to travel across (1 mountain symbol on card means Magic clouds are fast in mountains). If the same tile was placed on a road in forest terrain it would require 2 Magic Cloud cards to travel that route (2 Forest symbols on card means Magic Clouds are slow in Forest).  Magic Clouds cannot travel in desert terrain at all (no desert symbols on card). All modes of transport are different and Rafts can be used on rivers or lakes without needing tiles. Rafts go slow upstream (2 raft cards needed) and fast downstream (1 card needed).  The small lake requires 1 raft card to travel across and the larger lake requires 2 cards to travel across.  Players may keep one unused transport counter and up to 4 Transportation cards from one round to the next.&#10;&#10;The second part of the round begins after all players have finished placing their transportation tiles for the round.  Each player plays his cards and moves his elf-boot around the board collecting his tokens from the cities visited.  If there is a Transport tile on a route and a player has no matching Transportation card he may 'Caravan' across it by playing any 3 Transportation cards from his hand.&#10;&#10;As a bit of 'take that' each player has a trouble tile which can be placed next to any transportation tile during the first part of the round.  This counter means that in order to travel that path an additional card of the transport type must be played or 4 cards to 'Caravan'.&#10;&#10;Victory: if at the end of round 3 a player has visited all 20 cities he is the winner.  If not the game ends after round 4 when 'Home' cities are revealed and each player subtracts points for each city he is away from his 'home' subtracting that from his collected city tokens.  The person with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.67221;2.1511;2;6;60;10;Fantasy, Travel
11;Bohnanza;"Bohnanza is the first in the Bohnanza family of games and has been published in several different editions, including a 2023 version with flowers.&#10;&#10;This entry lists a few different major card sets for Bohnanza: the base game for 3-5 players, the expanded game with the same name for 2-7 players (that is, first expansion included), and Bohnanza Pocket.&#10;&#10;In the game, you plant, then harvest bean cards in order to earn coins. Each player starts with a hand of random bean cards, and each card has a number on it corresponding to the number of that type of beans in the deck. Unlike in most other card games, you can't rearrange the order of cards in hand, so you must use them in the order that you've picked them up from the deck &mdash; unless you can trade them to other players, which is the heart of the game.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you must plant the first one or two cards in your hand into the &quot;fields&quot; in front of you. Each field can hold only one type of bean, so if you must plant a type of bean that's not in one of your fields, then you must harvest a field to make room for the new arrival. This usually isn't good! Next, you reveal two cards from the deck, and you can then trade these cards as well as any card in your hand for cards from other players. You can even make future promises for cards received right now! After all the trading is complete &mdash; and all trades on a turn must involve the active player &mdash; then you end your turn by drawing cards from the deck and placing them at the back of your hand.&#10;&#10;When you harvest beans, you receive coins based on the number of bean cards in that field and the &quot;beanometer&quot; for that particular type of bean. Flip over 1-4 cards from that field to transform them into coins, then place the remainder of the cards in the discard pile. When the deck runs out, shuffle the discards, playing through the deck two more times. At the end of the game, everyone can harvest their fields, then whoever has earned the most coins wins.&#10;&#10;The original German edition supports 3-5 players. The English version from Rio Grande Games comes with the first edition of the first German expansion included in a slightly oversized box. One difference in the contents, however, is that bean #22's Weinbrandbohne (Brandy Bean) was replaced by the Wachsbohne, or Wax Bean. This edition includes rules for up to seven players, like the Erweiterungs-Set, but also adapts the two-player rules of Al Cabohne in order to allow two people to play Bohnanza.&#10;&#10;";1997;7.06964;1.6672;2;7;45;12;Card Game, Farming, Negotiation
12;Ra;"Ra is an auction and set-collection game with an Ancient Egyptian theme.  Each turn players are able to purchase lots of tiles with their bidding tiles (suns).  Once a player has used up his or her suns, the other players continue until they do likewise, which may set up a situation with a single uncontested player bidding on tiles before the end of the round occurs.  Tension builds because the round may end before all players have had a chance to win their three lots for the epoch.  The various tiles either give immediate points, prevent negative points for not having certain types at the end of the round (epoch), or give points after the final round.  The game lasts for three &quot;epochs&quot; (rounds).  The game is easy to learn.&#10;&#10;From the Box:&#10;The game spans 1500 years of Egyptian history in less than an hour!&#10;The players seek to expand their power and fame and there are many ways to accomplish this: Influencing Pharaohs, Building monuments, Farming on the Nile, Paying homage to the Gods, Advancing the technology and culture of the people. Ra is an auction and set collecting game where players may choose to take risks for great rewards or... And all this is for the glory of the Sun God Ra!&#10;&#10;";1999;7.66554;2.315;2;5;60;12;Ancient, Mythology
13;CATAN;"In CATAN (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine which resources the island produces. Players build structures by 'spending' resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) which are represented by the relevant resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore, fields produce wheat, and pastures produce sheep.&#10;&#10;Set-up includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each depicting one of the five resource-producing terrain types--or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. A number disk, the value of which will correspond to the roll of two 6-sided dice, are placed on each terrain tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are placed on intersections and borders of the terrain tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which terrain tiles their last-placed settlement is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of rolling the dice, collecting resource cards based on this dice roll and the position of settlements (or upgraded cities&mdash;think: hotels), turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, possibly playing a development card, or trading resource cards with other players. If the dice roll is a 7, the active player moves the robber to a new terrain tile and steals a resource card from another player who has a settlement adjacent to that tile.&#10;&#10;Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road or the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), s/he announces this and claims the win.&#10;&#10;";1995;7.09405;2.2875;3;4;120;10;Economic, Negotiation
14;Basari;"Basari is a game of gem merchants competing in a marketplace&quot;: racing, collecting, trading, and predicting what the other merchants will do.&#10;&#10;To start the game, players receive 12 gemstones (3 each of 4 colors). &#10;Each turn there will be a movement phase and an action phase:&#10;&#10;For movement, everyone simultaneously rolls their die and moves their markers around a track.&#10;&#10;They then choose one of three different actions to perform. The actions are:&#10;- to take a variety of gems from a market stall, &#10;- to immediately score from between 4 and 7 points, or &#10;- to roll and move again and also collect points.&#10;&#10;The action cards are revealed simultaneously. If only 1 player chose a particular action, they simply perform that action. If 2 players chose the same action, they barter back and forth with gemstones. One player will eventually accept the other's offer of gems, and the other will take the action. If 3 or 4 players all chose the same action card, that action is cancelled. Note that in 4-player games, there will always be a conflict in choice of 3 actions, so much more negotiating goes on.&#10;&#10;A new turn begins with everyone rolling their die, moving, then choosing and revealing their action cards. When any merchant piece completes a lap around the board, the round ends and bonus points are awarded based on who has the majority in each gem color and who has completed a lap. After three rounds, the game is over and the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Edel, Stein & Reich&#10;&#10;&#10;";1998;6.74684;1.8478;3;4;25;10;Negotiation

Players can then move them into their own like-colored shops to earn money or move them into opponents' shops for a share of the profits.

18;RoboRally;"The robots of the RoboRally automobile factory spend their weekdays toiling at the assembly line. They put in hard hours building high-speed supercars they never get to see in action. But on Saturday nights, the factory becomes a world of mad machines and dangerous schemes as these robots engage in their own epic race.It takes speed, wits, and dirty tricks to become a racing legend! Each player chooses a robot and directs its moves by playing cards. Chaos ensues as all players reveal the cards they've chosen. Players face obstacles like industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyor belts -- but those can also be used to their advantage! Each player aims to make it to each of the checkpoints in numerical order. The first player to reach all of the checkpoints wins. &#10;&#10;In RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.&#10;&#10;In general, players will first fill all of their robot's &quot;registers&quot; with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it!&#10;&#10;Robots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style.&#10;&#10;The game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in 2005.&#10;&#10;UPC 742818050029&#10;&#10;";1994;7.05045;2.4285;2;8;120;12;Maze, Miniatures, Racing, Science Fiction
19;Wacky Wacky West;"A long time ago, in a village far, far away, some disturbed townsfolk decided to destroy their entire town in order to rid themselves of an evil menace (it's technically a dog-mouse, but I think it's an idiomatic thing).  Anyway, so the villagers rebuilt all the buildings in the town (including their precious outhouses), but forgot to include city walls, a river, or roads.  To rectify this, players lay tiles with one of these three things onto the board, and any building caught underneath them is automatically eliminated, except for outhouses.  When an outhouse would be destroyed, players take a vote on whether to place that particular section.  Each player is trying to retain the most of one type of building, and once all the pieces have been placed the winner is the person with the highest valued buildings still standing.&#10;&#10;Wacky, Wacky West re-make description:&#10;&#10;Fans of Klaus Teuber will be interested in this remake/redesign of Drunter und Dr&uuml;ber, a 1991 Spiel des Jahres winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;Just south of nowhere, there's the junction of the Mayfair &amp; Rossdorf RR and the Turvy Trunk Line. Springing up from the desert like a tumbleweed lies the eccentric little town of Rossdorf. Like most western towns, Rossdorf has a Land Agent: Guy Dough, the brother of that wicked varmint Black Benny. A shrewd opportunist, Guy's done sold all the town land ('ceptin' the outhouses) four times over! Every acre in town that ain't got an outhouse on it is owned by the miners, the railroads, AND the fort captain. Just about a year ago, miners digging in the shadow of Fort Rossdorf struck the mother lode! But it wasn't gold, and it wasn't silver. No, my friend, it was just a little spring. Not any ordinary spring, though! It was a torrent of that mind-marbling drink the locals call &quot;Wacky Water!&quot; &#10;&#10;&#10;Now that water's done what the sun and the wind couldn't do: it's made those landholders brave enough to take matters into their own hands. Now they'll use whatever means they can to bowl over the competition and lay claim to the only fertile spots left in town! Now the only thing stoppin' 'em is the Town Charter Amendment #5, which states: &quot;no landholder may move, remove, or detonate any outhouse without a majority vote of the Town Citizens...&quot; Now one thing's for sure: something's gonna stink in Rossdorf, purty darn soon.....&#10;&#10;&#10;In Wacky Wacky West you and your fellow townfolk place track tiles, street tiles, and river tiles hoping to destroy your rivals' buildings. Every time someone tries to build over a precious outhouse, the town votes! You try to enlist your supporters (represented by cards) to vote with you to stop or encourage the play of certain tiles-perhaps saving some of your buildings or taking out those of your dastardly opponents.&#10;&#10;";1991;6.27644;1.8204;2;4;45;9;American West, Bluffing, City Building
20;Full Metal Planète;"In this game of science fiction strip mining, players land on a planet and try and grab as much ore as possible and take off before the game is over.  Each player has tanks, boats, barges, mining equipment and a base ship at his disposal and will have to contend with the weather and the other miners.  The game uses an action point allowance system and thus is dice free.  Each player on his turn has a pool of points that he can divide in a variety of ways, putting all the points into one unit's movement or dividing them among several units.  Each turn is timed so players have to think quickly, and once a move has been made it cannot be retracted.  The game itself is beautifully put together, with a detailed hex grid and real metal miniatures for all of the units.&#10;&#10;Online Play: &#10;&#10;    Full Metal Galaxy&#10;    Full Metal Program&#10;    VASSAL module&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Full Metal Conqu&#195;&#170;te (as a two-player version)&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Full Metal Planete: Plateau Modulaire.&#10;&#10;&#10;Microbadges:&#10; - Full Metal Plan&egrave;te fan  Buy It&#10;&#10;";1988;7.50139;3.1429;2;4;90;12;Miniatures, Science Fiction

22;Magic Realm;"From the 2nd edition rulebook intro for MAGIC REALM:&#10;&#10;MAGIC REALM is a game of fantasy adventuring, set in a land filled with monsters, fabulous treasures, great warriors, and magicians. The scene is set in the ruins of a mighty kingdom, now inhabited by sparse groups of natives and swarms of monsters. Beneath it all are the rich remnants of a magical civilization, scattered and lost across the map.&#10;To this scene come the adventurers, seekers of riches and fame, to make a name for themselves in this promising field. Swordsman and Dwarf, Magician and Sorceror, the humans and the half-humans come seeking to loot the legendary riches of a lost civilization. Now you can play the part of one of these adventurers, stepping into an unknown Realm of magic and monsters, battles and treasures.&#10;&#10;As a player, you will take on the role of one of the sixteen major characters who are represented in detail in the game. You will control where he goes, what he tries to do, how he handles himself in combat, and much more. In the course of the game, you will run into deadly monsters, tribes of humans ranging from old friends to sworn enemies, and treasures that will enhance your abilities in many ways.&#10;&#10;MAGIC REALM is a complex game designed to recapture the suspense and desperate struggles of fantasy literature. The game creates a small but complete fantasy world, where each game is a new adventure with a new map where everything lies hidden at new locations. The game includes many more playing pieces than are actually used in a single playing. The additional pieces are set up and can appear, depending on the directions in which the characters explore, but many of the treasure troves, treasures, and spells will still be set up, unfound, when the game ends, and many of the monsters and natives might never be met. The result is an extremely unpredictable game full of surprises, a game that plays very differently each time it is played.&#10;The complete game system includes hiking, hiding and searching, fatigue, wounds, rest, trade, hiring natives, and combat between characters, monsters, and natives using a variety of weapons on horseback and afoot, as well as many magical effects.&#10;&#10;Between exploring a new land where the mountains, caves, valleys, and woods change every game, and not knowing what you will find in each place, you will find each game a new and unpredictable adventure, filled with surprises. You will find this like no other board game you have ever played.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 9&#10;&#10;See also the list of articles about Magic Realm in The General.&#10;&#10;";1979;7.29996;4.562;1;16;240;12;Adventure, Exploration, Fantasy, Fighting
23;Divine Right;"Divine Right combines combat, diplomacy, and role-playing into 2-6 hours of fast-paced action as each player attempts to build and hold together an alliance of kings long enough to defeat the other players and win the game. The kingdoms of humans, elves, goblins, dwarves and trolls are pawns in the power games that absolute monarchs play. Ambassadors vie for the attention of the kings whose favor they curry. Assassination and backstabbing are popular pastimes, and loyal allies may leave your side in the heat of battle at the drop of a hat &mdash; or a die. The magicians, too, get their arcane fingers into things, and the gods intervene as well. It is a situation that demands skill and luck.&#10;&#10;The box contains rule book, full-color mapsheet, over 250 die-cut counters, dice, and cards.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Divine Right: Scarlet Empire&#10;&#10;&#10;";1979;7.20459;3.1688;2;6;360;12;Fantasy, Political, Wargame

26;Age of Renaissance;"A game that is often described as a semi-sequel to Civilization.&#10;&#10;Players attempt to build up their cultures during the Middle Ages and Renaissance periods. The game features a card deck that holds events, payout cards, and famous leaders of the particular eras. Although all cards will turn up somewhere during the game, the timing and position in which they will be played is crucial and will ensure a different game every time.&#10;&#10;The main goal of each city-state is to gain points in the form of technical advances, while keeping their culture's misery level as low as possible. The payout structure is similar to those of Civilization and Advanced Civilization in that more resources of the same type yield increasingly higher payouts. This time particular payouts are triggered by card play for every player at once. An ingenious and very smooth working &ldquo;combat&rdquo; system is implemented to determine province &ndash; and thus resource - control.&#10;&#10;";1996;7.09318;3.8495;3;6;300;12;Civilization, Economic, Medieval, Renaissance

30;Dark Tower;"An epic fantasy quest to recover an ancient magic scepter from a tyrant king in his Dark Tower, brought to life in electronic form.&#10;&#10;To vanquish the usurper, players search the four realms of the circular game board for three keys to unlock the tower's gate.  On this journey, there are battles to be fought against roving bands of brigands, dragons, plague and hunger.  There are bazaars to visit to purchase supplies and assistants for the quest.  There are uncharted territories to get lost in and tombs and ruins to plunder.  And there is a mighty army to be raised before the player can lay siege to the tower and fight either to glorious victory or crushing defeat.&#10;&#10;Dark Tower was technologically impressive when it was released in 1981.  Gameplay was facilitated by a small computer inside the black plastic shell of the tower itself.  Players input their moves on a small membrane keypad each turn and the computer took over from there, doing everything from conducting the progress of battles to keeping track of how much (or little) food was left to feed the players' always hungry warriors. The computer would play brief musical serenades at significant points of the game.&#10;&#10;";1981;6.88774;1.802;1;4;90;10;Adventure, Electronic, Exploration, Fantasy, Fighting

Federation &amp; Empire is a stand alone game, and Star Fleet Battles is not required or needed to play this game.&#10;&#10;The two games are closely related, and Star Fleet Battles can be used to resolve some or all of the tactical battles of Federation &amp; Empire, and Federation &amp; Empire can be used as a campaign system for Star Fleet Battles.&#10;&#10;The original version came out in 1986, and was published by Task Force Games.  This was followed in 1990 with the &quot;Deluxe&quot; version, which replaced the original release.  &quot;Deluxe&quot; was indicated on the front of the box to indicate it was the new version.  The Deluxe version included a revised rule book, more counter sheets, and other player aids such as the battle board and player folio.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Deluxe&quot; version had three expansions:&#10;&#10;    Federation & Empire: Carrier War&#10;    Federation & Empire: F & E Module 1 &#226;&#128;&#147; Special Operations&#10;    Federation & Empire: F & E Module 2 &#226;&#128;&#147; Marine Assault&#10;&#10;&#10;In 2000, another revision of the rules was completed, and the F&amp;E 2K (as it is called) version stood for a decade.&#10;&#10;In 2010 the countersheets were entirely redone (with a larger number of counters per sheet) and the rulebook was once again revised to incorporate the last 10 years of errata and rulings, allowing a better integration with the expansions that were released during this period.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Federation & Empire: Advanced Operations&#10;    Federation & Empire: Combined Operations (combined and replaced Federation & Empire: F & E Module 1 &#226;&#128;&#147; Special Operations and Federation & Empire: F & E Module 2 &#226;&#128;&#147; Marine Assault)&#10;    Federation & Empire: Fighter Operations (replaced Federation & Empire: Carrier War)&#10;    Federation & Empire: Planetary Operations&#10;    Federation & Empire: Strategic Operations&#10;    Federation & Empire: ISC War&#10;    Federation & Empire: Minor Empires&#10;&#10;&#10;Since 2010 ADB has created, in both print and pdf form, Compendium I, II and III.

41;Can't Stop;"In this Sid Sackson classic, players must press their luck with dice and choose combinations tactically to close out three columns. The board has one column for each possible total of two six-sided dice, but the number of spaces in each column varies: the more probable a total, the more spaces in that column and the more rolls it takes to complete. On their turn, a player rolls four dice and arranges them in duos: 1 4 5 6 can become 1+4 and 5+6 for 5 &amp; 11, 1+5 and 4+6 for 6 &amp; 10, or 1+6 and 4+5 for 7 &amp; 9. The player places or advances progress markers in the open column(s) associated with their chosen totals, then chooses whether to roll again or end their turn and replace the progress markers with markers of their color. A player can only advance three different columns in a turn and cannot advance a column which any player has closed out by reaching the end space; if a roll doesn&rsquo;t result in any legal plays, the turn ends with that turn&rsquo;s progress lost.&#10;&#10;A predecessor from 1974, The Great Races, exists as a paper-and-pencil game.&#10;&#10;";1980;6.92532;1.1439;2;4;30;9;Dice
42;Tigris & Euphrates;"Regarded by many as Reiner Knizia's masterpiece, Tigris &amp; Euphrates is set in the ancient fertile crescent with players building civilizations through tile placement. Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized. Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board, i.e., external conflicts, with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict. Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts.&#10;&#10;Starting in the Mayfair edition from 2008, Tigris &amp; Euphrates included a double-sided game board and extra components for playing an advanced version of the game. This &quot;ziggurat expansion&quot;, initially released as a separate item in Germany for those who already owned the base game, is a special monument that extends across five spaces of the board. The monument can be built if a player has a cross of five civilization tokens of the same color by discarding those five tokens and replacing them with the ziggurat markers, placing a ziggurat tower upon the middle tile. The five ziggurat markers cannot be destroyed. All rules regarding monuments apply to the ziggurat monument as well. If your king is inside the kingdom of the ziggurat, you will get one victory point in a color of your choice at the end of your turn.&#10;&#10;Some versions of Tigris &amp; Euphrates are listed as being for 2-4 players, while others incorrectly state that they're for 3-4 players. Tigris &amp; Euphrates is part of what is sometimes called Reiner Knizia's tile-laying trilogy.&#10;&#10;";1997;7.70218;3.4959;2;4;120;14;Abstract Strategy, Ancient, Civilization, Territory Building
43;Airlines;"Airlines' theme is exactly as suggested by the title. The game is similar to the Sid Sackson classic, Acquire, in that players are competing to become majority stockholders in several highly-abstracted companies with the player owning the most valuable portfolio at the end being the winner.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player chooses from one of two actions: expand an airline and put stock into his hand, or play stock from his hand. Expanding an airline adds to its route(s) on the board and increases its value but the trick is that when a scoring card shows up (randomly), only played stock counts as a player's holdings.&#10;&#10;";1990;6.57678;2.4242;2;6;90;12;Aviation / Flight, Economic
44;David & Goliath;"This game adds a very interesting twist to the standard trick-taking genre.  There are five suits and players must follow suit, if they can.  However, the winner of the trick is the highest card played, regardless of suit.  The winner gets all the cards from the trick, minus the card he won it with.  That card is given to the player that played the lowest card.  After all tricks have been played, the scoring begins.  Players score the face-value of the cards in the suits that they only collected one or two of, and one point per card for suits with more than two.  The player with the most points after a number of hands wins the game.&#10;&#10;";1997;6.49205;1.623;3;6;60;8;Card Game
45;Perudo;"Liar's Dice, a.k.a. Bluff, Perudo or Dudo, is a South American dice game in which each player is given five dice and cup to roll and hide them with. Players make successively higher declarations regarding the results of all the dice remaining in the game, e.g. &quot;there are ten sixes&quot;. However, someone can always contest the bid. When that happens, all the dice are revealed and either the bidder or the caller loses dice, depending on who was correct. The last player with dice is the winner.&#10;&#10;As a public domain dice game, there are a number of variants or similar games called Liar's Dice. This includes one that is often played with Poker Dice, and differs from the marketed versions in that players only declare on their own hand's value (as opposed to all dice being in play), using poker-hand values.&#10;&#10;";1800;6.92315;1.2518;2;6;30;8;Bluffing, Children's Game, Dice, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Party Game
46;Medici;"Another Reiner Knizia standby, this game plays very well with varying numbers of people.  The object is to accrue the most points during three rounds, which you do by spending your points to bid on sets of cards.  Each turn the current player turns up one to three cards for all the players to bid on, with the highest bid taking all cards.  The cards denote a commodity type and quantity/value.  The round ends when each player's ships are full, or the commodity card deck is exhausted.  After each round, points are awarded to each player having the most of a given commodity, and to the one with the most valuable total &quot;cargo load&quot;.&#10;&#10;Part of the Knizia auction trilogy.&#10;One of the Knizia Florentine auction games.&#10;&#10; Related Games: &#10;&#10;&#10;     Medici vs Strozzi (two-player version)&#10;     Strozzi&#10;     Mercator, included in Neue Spiele im alten Rom (ancestor to Medici).&#10;&#10;&#10;";1995;7.18231;2.2212;2;6;60;10;Renaissance

In it, players acquire ownership of sections of city blocks then place tiles, representing businesses, onto the block-sections.  At the end of each turn, each tile you've laid gives you some sort of payout, but completed businesses (formed of three to six connected tiles of the same type) pay quite a bit better.  All these resources are dealt to the players randomly, however, so players must trade to get matching businesses and adjacent locations.&#10;&#10;This game is #2 in the Alea big box series.&#10;&#10;";1999;7.43746;2.2359;3;5;60;12;City Building, Economic, Negotiation
48;Krieg und Frieden;"Taking on the roles of land-owners in a feudal society, players are charged with running their lands and accruing favor from the bishop by building his cathedral.  Each turn, players use their resources to bid for that year's agenda, and some resources have more or less value in the bid depending on what type of agenda is available.  Then players use their remaining resources to build their lands, sack others' lands, bribe others' knights away from defense, or help to build the bishop's cathedral.  Finally, players harvest new resources for the next turn.  After all the pieces of the cathedral have been built, the game is over with the victory going to the player with the most victory points.  This game was originally released as Charlemagne by Think Games at Essen 1998, and later slightly shortened as Krieg und Frieden.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Charlemagne&#10;&#10;&#10;";1999;6.09079;2.4638;2;4;90;12;Medieval, Political
49;Mamma Mia!;"Designer Uwe Rosenberg has a talent for dreaming up new and inventive card games, and Mamma Mia! is a perfect example of this talent, with players placing pizza ingredients into a combined pool, then trying to time their pizza baking in order to make use of what's available in the kitchen.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with eight different pizza orders to fill, with one of those order cards in hand; each player also starts with a hand of ingredient cards (showing pepperoni, mushroom, pineapple, green pepper or olive). On a turn, a player lays down one or more ingredient cards of a single type into a common stack, then optionally adds a pizza order card to that stack. He then refills his hand by drawing as many cards as he played from either the shared ingredient deck or his own order deck.&#10;&#10;After the draw pile is exhausted, the shared pile of cards is flipped over and sorted by ingredients until an order comes up. If enough ingredient cards are available to fill that order, the owner scores it; if not, the player can make up the difference by playing cards from his hand (and thereby scoring the order) or else return the card to the bottom of his order deck.&#10;&#10;Once all the orders are scored or returned, shuffle the ingredients used in pizzas and start another round of play. After three complete rounds, the player who's filled the most orders wins!&#10;&#10;";1998;6.48129;1.362;2;5;30;10;Card Game, Memory
50;Lost Cities;"Lost Cities is a card game in the Kosmos two-player series. The game originally consisted of a single deck of cards of rank 2&ndash;10 in five different colors with three special &quot;handshakes&quot; (&quot;HS&quot; in scoring examples below) in each suit, but as of 2018 the game now includes six colored suits, with the sixth color being optional for gameplay. A game board is included to organize discarded cards and help players organize their card collections.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the colored suits of cards. On a player's turn, they must first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the color-appropriate discard pile, then draw one card, either from the deck or from the top of a discard pile. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order, but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.&#10;&#10;The game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the deck. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total; one handshake doubles an expedition's value, while two handshakes triples that value and three handshakes quadruple it. Expeditions start at a value of -20, so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least eight cards played into it. A complete game of Lost Cities lasts three matches, with scores for each match being added together.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 1: An expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30. This expedition is worth 10 total points: 30 plus the initial -20.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 2: An expedition has 2 HS, and 4,5,6,7,8,10 for a total of 40. This expedition is worth 80 total points: 40 points for cards, plus the initial -20, &times;3 for the two multipliers, plus the 20-pt bonus for playing 8+ cards.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 3: An expedition has 1 HS, and 4,6,7 for a total of 17. This expedition is worth -6 total points: 17 plus the initial -20, &times;2 for the multiplier.&#10;&#10;";1999;7.24936;1.476;2;2;30;10;Card Game, Exploration, Math
51;Ricochet Robots;"Ricochet Robots is less of a game and more of a puzzle, which explains why there's such an odd number of solutions possible. There's a four-piece modular board that forms a large room with walls spread around the board. There are also color-coded targets on boards. Placed on top of the surface are four robots. The idea for each turn/puzzle is to get the like-colored robot to a randomly selected target. The trick is that once a robot starts moving, it will continue to move until a wall or another robot stops it. Therefore, players are seeking a sequence of moves for the robots that will enable them to move the required robot to the target in the fewest moves.&#10;&#10;";1999;7.0339;2.3801;1;99;30;10;Abstract Strategy, Maze, Puzzle, Real-time

59;Giganten;"Besides attempting to find oil in dusty Texas, players must also try to outbid one another for sales contracts in the oil industry.  An oilfield with drilling sites scattered about is spread out before the players, who take their trucks out trying to grab those sites as quickly as possible.&#10;&#10;Three groups of tiles are laid over the drilling sites, giving a range of value for each site once it has been reached by a player.  The deeper a site is into the field the greater its overall yield. But players have to weigh this against creating a constant supply from the smaller yields that are closer at the beginning of the game.&#10;&#10;Once oil has been produced, players can attempt to sell it on the market. But there are only three companies, and with four players this means that one player will be shut out each turn.  Bidding has an interesting element to it in that player's bidding pools are hidden from one another, making it difficult to tell whether a player is bluffing.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented as Black Gold&#10;&#10;";1999;6.69443;2.5693;3;4;90;10;Economic, Exploration, Industry / Manufacturing

64;Joan of Arc;"Joan of Arc, a game of &quot;Conquest and Perfidy in the Kingdom of France&quot;, deals with the conflicts in France during the Hundred Years' War.  It's a multiplayer wargame with a card-driven combat system and a political layer that players must contend with.&#10;&#10;For just over one hundred years England and France battled over who would sit on the French throne. Even within France itself factions developed, putting forth their own candidates challenging the rights of the Dauphin. From this struggle heroes emerged, notably the Black Prince and Jeanne d'Arc, The Maid of Orleans. Tremendous battles were fought at Crecy, Poitiers and Agincourt, yet their impact on the war was ephemeral. Long sieges followed short campaigns, bands of the notorious Free Companies, temporarily unemployed, marauded across the countryside in search of rapine and plunder. Complicating matters, both famine and plague poisoned the seasons. All in all, 'twas a grand time!&#10;&#10;The game randomly lasts from 8 to 10 turns.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player with the most Pretender Points.  &#10;Points are gained at the end of each turn for each Province a player controls.  &#10;Controlled cities gain revenue.

Each player leads a nation of peoples over a map board of the Eastern Mediterranean and Near East as they attempt to carve a niche for themselves and their culture.&#10;&#10;Although battles and territorial strategy are important, this is not a war game because it is not won by battle or conquest. Instead, the object of play is to gain a level of overall advancement involving cultural, economic, and political factors so that such conflicts that do arise are a result of rivalry and land shortage rather than a desire to eliminate other players. Nomad and farmer, warrior and merchant, artisan and citizen all have an essential part to play in the development of civilization. It is the player who most effectively changes emphasis between these various outlooks who will achieve the best balance and win.&#10;&#10;(from the Introduction to the Avalon Hill edition rulebook)&#10;&#10;This game has a huge following and is widely regarded as one of the best games about ancient civilizations. Each player takes on the role of leader of an ancient civilization, such as the Illyrians or Babylonians. Your task is to guide your people through the ages by expanding your empire and using its proceeds to finance new technological advances, such as Literacy, Metalworking, or Law. The advancements help your civilization better cope with its problems as well as help bring new advancements.&#10;&#10;Civilization is widely thought to be the first game ever to incorporate a &quot;technology tree,&quot; allowing players to gain certain items and abilities only after particular other items were obtained.

Players have to contend with production, supply, command control and whether to try and break the other side's lines.  Several scenarios cover every major point of the war.  The game comes with a fantastic, detailed map of Eastern Europe and Russia printed on cardstock and many wooden blocks for the units.  This is a stand alone game that can also serve as one element of the complete EuroFront series which covers the entire European conflict of WWII.&#10;&#10;This title uses the Columbia Games Block system.  While there are variations in the rule sets, all of the &quot;Front&quot; series of games are based on the block system.  Basically this means that rather than using traditional counters to represent units on the map the game uses wooden blocks that stand upright with unit details only shown on one side.  This accomplishes two things:  First it provides an easy way of producing a &quot;fog of war&quot; because your opponent cannot tell, save through good memory or deduction, what type of unit a specific piece is or its current strength.  Second, having the blocks stand on end allows the possibility of rotating a block so the current strength is the top number.  Although most war games have some type of mechanism that allows units to take losses in steps of their overall strength, counters normally have at most two steps because they only have two sides.  Blocks, however, have four so you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide.&#10;&#10;With the use of blocks, Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding complex layers of bookkeeping, allowing interesting and relatively short sessions of play.&#10;&#10;";1991;7.67447;3.6;2;2;240;12;Wargame, World War II

91;Paths of Glory;"(from GMT Games' website:)&#10;&#10;They called it the Great War. In over four years of titanic struggle, the ancient Europe of Kings and Emperors tore itself to pieces, giving birth to our own violent modern age. The bloody battles fought in the trenches of the Western Front, the icy plains of Poland, the mountains of the Balkans, and the deserts of Arabia, shaped the world we know today. We are all orphans of the Great War.&#10;&#10;Paths of Glory: The First World War, designed by six-time Charles S. Roberts awards winner, Ted Raicer, allows players to step into the shoes of the monarchs and marshals who triumphed and bungled from 1914 to 1918. As the Central Powers you must use the advantage of interior lines and the fighting skill of the Imperial German Army to win your rightful 'place in the sun.' As the Entente Powers (Allies) you must bring your greater numbers to bear to put an end to German militarism and ensure this is the war 'to end all wars.' Both players will find their generalship and strategic abilities put to the test as Paths of Glory's innovative game systems let you recreate all the dramatic events of World War I.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;     316 full-color die-cut counters:&#10;         176 5/8&rdquo; die cut counters&#10;         140 1/2&rdquo; die cut counters&#10;    &#10;     One 22x34&quot; full-color mapsheet showing most of Europe and the Near East&#10;     110 Strategy Cards&#10;     32-page Rule Book including sample game replay (21 pages of actual rules)&#10;     Two Player Reference Cards &#10;&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Ted Raicer&#10;DEVELOPER: Andy Lewis&#10;ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

The game covers WWI from its outbreak to American intervention and spans all of Europe and the Middle East.  Not only is the game innovative, but it also plays fast, usually within just an evening.&#10;&#10;While the game itself has all of the normal expectations of a wargame, with various units, CRT charts and period chrome, at heart the game rests within the card play.  Players are given a hand of cards to play out six sub-phases of a turn.  Each sub-phase allows for the use of a card or a pass with a minimal movement of units.  Each card has four possible uses: operational movement, strategic movement, special events, and replacement points.  The cardplay forces players to constantly make tough decsions as they feel that they need to do a little bit of everything but they can only do one thing at a time.  How you play your cards will decide to a large degree the outcome of the war.&#10;&#10;";1999;8.07689;3.854;2;2;480;14;Wargame, World War I
93;El Grande;"In this award-winning game, players take on the roles of Grandes in medieval Spain.  The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions.  To that end, you draft caballeros (knights) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions.  After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).&#10;&#10;A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards vary from round to round.&#10;&#10;The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had there into the region you secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande and in the region containing the king.&#10;&#10;";1995;7.76343;2.9434;2;5;120;12;Medieval, Renaissance
95;Igel Ärgern;"Translated literally, the title means &quot;Hedgehog Irking&quot; (or a bit more loosely, &quot;Annoying the Hedgehogs&quot;), but the game is usually referred to in English as &quot;Hedgehogs in a Hurry.&quot; This game gives players several wooden disks (the hedgehogs) to place in one of six rows.  During a turn, you roll a die, optionally move any of your hedgehogs one row left or right, then move any hedgehog (not necessarily yours!) in the row your rolled forward one space.  But watch out for black spaces; hedgehogs caught there can't continue moving until they're in last place.  The first player to get three of their four hedgehogs to the end of the board wins.  Some later versions of this game come with dozens of different variants to keep the game interesting.&#10;&#10;";1990;6.39253;1.378;2;6;30;8;Animals, Children's Game, Dice
97;Conquest of the Empire;"Conquest of the Empire is part of Milton Bradley&#039;s Gamemaster series.  It is set during the Roman Empire and depicts the struggle around the Mediterranean as rival factions attempt to take control of the empire.  Each player plays one of these factions and receives a Caesar figure, several general figures, and ships of a specific color.  Along with these leaders, players utilize a pool of generic units composed of infantry, cavalry, and catapults.  All game pieces are plastic figures.&#10;&#10;Players attempt to conquer their neighbors and build up cities and fortifications to increase production of wealth.  Players also may build road networks that allow for faster movement, by all armies.  Along the way players have to contend with rising inflation which makes military units more and more expensive.  Eventually through elimination one player pulls ahead for the win.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Eagle Games&#039;s Conquest of the Empire (2005)&#10;&#10;&#10;";1984;6.29748;2.5294;2;6;240;10;Ancient, Economic, Wargame
99;Fortress America;"Fortress America, originally part of Milton Bradley's Gamemaster series, depicts an alternate near-future in which all of the world attacks and invades the continental United States. From the west arrives hordes of Asian foes; from the south arrives a union of South American countries through Mexico, and from the east lands come legions of Soviets who have taken over all of Europe. America besieged has to rely on the remaining ground and air forces left in the country along with partisan uprisings to defend mom's apple pie.&#10;&#10;Up to four players can play Fortress America, one player being the U.S. and up to three others controlling the invading units from a particular direction. Being a near future scenario, the units in the game include conventional infantry, APCs, hovertanks, helicopters, bombers, US partisan units, and special &quot;Star Wars&quot; laser relay systems that fire from space.&#10;&#10;The game emphasizes combined arms in that players receive a bonus if infantry, mechanized, and air power are all used in a conflict. For the invading countries, all the units they receive for the game are given at the start so they must manage them wisely. The U.S., however, starts with a skeleton defense and builds up throughout the game through a random deck of cards. Further, the U.S. slowly builds up its Star Wars system, so the longer the invaders are delayed, the more powerful the U.S. becomes both conventionally and through its defense system.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Fortress America (2012)&#10;&#10;&#10;";1986;6.72281;2.6305;2;4;180;12;Modern Warfare, Science Fiction, Wargame
101;Detroit-Cleveland Grand Prix;"This game is part of a family which includes Top Race, Daytona 500, and Formel 1.  Players are dealt a hand of cards which have movement numbers for one or more of the cars.  When a card is played, the cars are advanced the number of spaces indicated in order from top to bottom.  However, if the track is blocked, then that movement is lost, so the idea is to use the cards that help your opponents (which you'll likely have to play eventually) only when they won't be able to take advantage of the movement.&#10;&#10;";1996;6.77692;1.713;2;6;60;8;Card Game, Racing
103;Titan;"This classic game of the Fantasy Monster Slug-a-thon is a standby from the The Avalon Hill Game Co of yore.  The game still has a very devoted following, which is a tribute to the depth of the various strategies and approaches.  The game is divided into two realms, the masterboard and the battleboards.  On the masterboard, legions of mythical creatures roam about trying to recruit bigger and badder monsters and kill opposing legions in the process.  When a combat occurs, the action moves to the corresponding battleboard type corresponding to the area the fight is taking place in.  After lots of dice are tossed, the army that remains standing is returned to the masterboard with the spoils of war: points.&#10;&#10;The points are used to recruit Angels and Archangels and to augment the leader character of the player's army: The Titan.  As the points increase, the Titans become ever more powerful; at game end, the titan is able to kill most other character with a single blow. But be careful: If the Titan dies, the player is out of the game.&#10;&#10;The last Titan standing is the ruler of all, and winner of the game.&#10;&#10;";1980;6.96394;3.4642;2;6;240;12;Fantasy, Wargame
105;Colossal Arena;"Colossal Arena/Titan:The Arena is a strategic card game for 2 to 5 players: you play, not as combatants, but as spectators, cheering and betting on the melee ongoing in a fantasy arena/colosseum in which fantasy creatures are pitted against each other in battle!&#10;&#10;Each round one of the creatures will die. To decide which unlucky soul will be the victim, players put numbered power cards in front of the creatures, with the lowest one going to the graveyard.  The jockeying for position and strategic diplomacy in playing the numbered power cards can be intense - but what makes this game even more interesting is that the players' place bets throughout the game which will sometimes allow them to use a creature's special power in battle!&#10;&#10;The winner at the end of the game is the bettor who's raked in the most winnings - just another day in the life of a fantasy monster gambler.&#10;&#10;Titan: The Arena is actually a reworking of a Reiner Knizia game called Grand National Derby, but The Avalon Hill Game Co's remake was quite significant from a gameplay standpoint.&#10;&#10;The Titan: The Arena printing is often confused with its namesake, Titan.  But other than the fact that they both use fantasy creatures as a general theme, there is very little that is similar between the two.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by: Galaxy: The Dark Ages&#10;&#10;";1997;6.75862;2.0203;2;5;60;8;Card Game, Fantasy, Mythology
107;Peaceful Resistance;"This small-publisher game comes with loads of wooden hex-shaped tiles, a hex board, and three pawns.  The object of the game is to move your pawn from one corner of the hex board to the opposite corner.  However, instead of taking your move, you can place a hex tile on the board.  These are used to block your opponent, because while your pawn can always go down any number of hex tiles, it can only step up one level at a time.&#10;&#10;";1995;5.72353;1.0;2;3;30;0;Abstract Strategy
109;Wettstreit der Baumeister;"Jean du Po&#195;&#171;l put this game out on the market for about a year before the game's name was changed to Wettstreit der Baumeister in 1998.&#10;&#10;This translates to &quot;Contest of the Architects&quot;. The game has a beautiful assortment of large, thick tiles to represent the cities. Players bid on a single building tile every turn, with half the proceeds going to the auctioning player. When a player is ready to start construction of his city, the tiles are laid out in order with the single restriction that not two touching tiles are the same type. The building types are city halls, churches, towers, and gates. When the one of the two draw piles is exhausted, the cities are judged for symmetry, with the highest scoring city winning.&#10;&#10;Rules apply to either game:&#10;&#10;Within two decks of 20 cards are contained the City Wall, Towers and Gates, Churches, City Halls, etc. During play, one of the decks lies face up, the other face down. There are three parts to each player's turn. First, the player rolls a die in an attempt to better his finances (1 to 5 on the die; the sixth side gives a sabotage-counter instead). Second, he alone may look at the top hidden card before he makes an offer on either of the two top cards from the two decks. The other players then bid on the two cards. If the player (the Auctioneer) makes the highest bid, he may take the card and pay the bank. If, on the other hand, one of the other players buys the card, that player pays half the money to the bank and half to the Auctioneer. Third, a player may either build (lay down another card on his city) or sabotage a City Card of another player. The player receiving the sabotage must then pay the value of the card or remove it.&#10;&#10;The game ends when either of the decks is depleted.&#10;&#10;";1994;6.11169;1.9643;3;4;45;10;City Building
111;Rheinländer;"This Reiner Knizia game, produced by Hasbro&#039;s European division, casts players in the roles of dukes who are trying to establish duchies along the banks of the Rhine River.  Players hold a hand of cards that correspond to numbered plots on each bank, and they place knights in open plots for which they hold the corresponding cards.  After establishing duchies, players attempt to expand them to include more plots of land, as well as buildings - such as castles, cathedrals, and cities. These buildings both add to the value of a duchy and provide their owners with advantages during game play.  Combined with a uniquely Knizia-style scoring system, this game has some very interesting dynamics.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.65568;2.3139;3;5;45;12;Abstract Strategy, Medieval, Territory Building
113;Plotters, Inc.;"Plotters, Inc., first released as Mit List und T&uuml;cke (&quot;With Cunning and Treachery&quot;), is a trick-taking game with quite a few twists. The deck consists of cards in four suits, and the deck is adjusted based on the player count so that everyone receives a hand of 14 cards to begin a round. At the start of a trick, the lead player plays any card, setting trump for that trick. Each other player plays any card that they like &mdash; except that once three colors of cards have been played, the fourth color cannot be played. Whoever plays the highest trump card wins the trick and collects two of the cards played (or three cards in a game with five or six players), placing these cards in front of them. Whoever plays the lowest non-trump card collects the remaining cards; this player leads to the next trick.&#10;&#10;Once a player has cards of all four colors in front of them, they must choose two colors and leave cards of this color face up, placing all other cards face down. As they collect more cards, they place them face up or face down based on their colors. The round ends after 14 tricks or when a player would be forced to play a card of the fourth color to a trick; in this latter case, the round ends immediately. Each player then scores the cards they've collected. For their two face-up colors, they multiply these numbers together; they then divide this product by the number of cards that they placed face down, rounding this number down. For example, if you have 6 yellow cards, 4 red cards, and 2 blue cards, then you have (6 &bull; 4)/2 = 12 points. If you collect cards of only one color, then you score 0 points!&#10;&#10;Play as many rounds as the number of players. Whoever has the highest total score wins!&#10;&#10;";1999;6.75621;1.8261;4;6;60;10;Card Game
115;I'm the Boss!;"The six Investor cards are shuffled and one is dealt face up to each player. Any Investor cards not dealt to the players are set aside for now. The Influence Card deck is shuffled and each player is dealt five cards face down. The player whose Investor is first in alphabetical order goes first. The player to the starting player&rsquo;s right places the Dollar marker on any space on the game board.&#10;&#10;Each space on the game board represents a potential deal which Investors have to approve the deal and the number of dividends to be paid to those investors.&#10;&#10;On one&rsquo;s turn, a player can open negotiations on the deal where the Dollar marker rests or roll the six-sided die. If the player rolls the die, the Dollar marker is advanced clockwise around the game board counting the available deals as spaces. Once the Dollar marker rests, the player may try to negotiate that deal or draw three Influence cards. If by drawing cards, the player&rsquo;s hand exceeds twelve the player chooses which cards to discard to the limit.&#10;&#10;Should a player choose to make the deal, the player negotiates with the player or players representing the Investors how to divide the money at stake. The amount is number of dividends written on the space multiplied by value of the shares written on the deal tile. Any or all of the players may use their Influence cards to affect the outcome of the deal:&#10;&#10;&bull;    Clan cards may act in place of Investors whether the Investors are in play or not.&#10;&bull;    Travel cards put Investors out of play for the negotiations. Some are specific for a given Investor; some are wild to be played on any Investor.&#10;&bull;    Recruitment cards can only be played in sets of three to steal another player&rsquo;s Investor and make it your own.&#10;&bull;    Boss cards give the player control of the negotiations.&#10;&bull;    Stop cards immediately stop the effects of Travel, Recruitment, and Boss Influence cards.&#10;&#10;The players are paid from the bank when a deal has been struck. The game board space is covered with the Deal tile (effectively closing the space from further game play), the Dollar marker is moved to the next open space, and play continues with next player.&#10;&#10;Once nine deals have been made, a die is rolled after each subsequent deal to determine whether the game ends (with the odds increasing each time). Victory goes to whoever has the biggest bankroll!&#10;&#10;--user description&#10;&#10;";1994;6.7726;1.9655;3;6;60;12;Economic, Negotiation
117;Ta Yü;"In Ta Y&uuml;, a game of connections, one side tries to extend from the starting tile in the center to reach the western and eastern edges of the board while the opposing side tries to reach the northern and southern edges.  On your turn you simply draw a tile and decide where to place it, extending the network of tiles already on the board.&#10;&#10;Several refinements make this simple proposition into an engrossing game.  First, each tile is 3x1 (to be played on a 19x19 board) and has exactly three outlets (potential connection points). Second, your score is not simply the number of spots you've reached on one edge added to the number of spots you've reached on the other, but is the product of those two numbers.  So you can't just concentrate on one side and ignore the other, because zero times anything is still zero.  Third, on each side of the board there are three special points which score double if reached, adding a dab of focus to the choices.&#10;&#10;Interestingly, you need to play both offense and defense and will often have to decide to which use to put a particular tile.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.94747;2.0662;2;4;45;10;Abstract Strategy
119;Cosmolancer;"Auf Heller und Pfennig takes participants to a medieval marketplace. Each turn, players place tiles onto the grid board that modify (either positively or negatively) the amount of money to be made by the shops that share that tile's row or column. Three times the board is filled with tiles and shop money is earned, after which the player with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;In Kingdoms, the first English-language version of Auf Heller und Pfennig, players try to collect the most gold by establishing castles in the richest regions of the realm while avoiding hazards like dragons, swamps, and trolls. The 2011 edition includes detailed plastic castles, a streamlined rulebook, and the addition of a wizard tile &mdash; one that increases the rank of adjacent castles, multiplying their scores &mdash; previously available only at game conventions.&#10;&#10;As of 2024, Cosmolancer is the newest version of this design, with players taking the role of freelance photographers...in space!

You retrieve all of your 1 tokens, but the others are now out of play.

Like Cosmic Encounter, it is a game that generates player interaction through negotiation and bluffing.&#10;&#10;Players each take the role of one of the factions attempting to control Dune. Each faction has special powers that overlook certain rules in the game. Each turn players move about the map attempting to pick up valuable spice while dealing with giant sandworms, deadly storms, and other players' military forces. A delicate political balance is formed amongst the factions to prevent any one side from becoming too strong. When a challenge is made in a territory, combat takes the form of hidden bids with additional treachery cards to further the uncertainty.&#10;&#10;The game concludes when one faction (or two allied factions) is able to control a certain number of strongholds on the planet.&#10;&#10;Note that the Descartes edition of Dune includes the Duel Expansion and Spice Harvest Expansion, the Landsraad variant from Avalon Hill's General magazine, and additional character disks not provided by AH.&#10;&#10;";1979;7.58628;3.4498;2;6;180;12;Bluffing, Fighting, Negotiation, Novel-based, Political, Science Fiction

Four cards from the deck are placed face up to its left and to its right.&#10;&#10;In a round, each player chooses a bid of one or more cards from their hand, then everyone reveals their bid simultaneously. Whoever bid the highest sum takes the four cards to the left or right of the deck or another player's bid, adds these cards to their hand, then places their bid next to the deck or in front of the player whose bid they took. (Alternatively, the player can return their bid to hand.) Then the next player with the highest bid resolves their bid similarly. Once all players have resolved their bids, draw cards from the deck to refill the lots to the left and right of the deck to four cards. When the deck runs out, play one final round, then score your cards in hand.&#10;&#10;If you have 200 or more in a single currency, score that many points.

While creative spelling of the words in question can be frowned upon, it's up to the guy next to you to determine your fate.&#10;&#10;Awards&#10;&#10;1996 &#195;&#133;rets Familiespil, Family Game of the Year Denmark&#10;&#10;";1994;5.82183;1.2872;2;10;20;12;Electronic, Party Game, Real-time, Word Game
139;Hoax;"The basic idea in Hoax is to pretend to be somebody you are not while working towards the goal of figuring out who other people are. Each player is assigned one of six different characters -- each with its own unique abilities -- but can pretend to be any character and use its corresponding powers.  Abilities are used to acquire 3 different types of goods, which can be spent to get clues to opponents' identities.  If the majority of the other players think you're pretending to be a character that you're not, you must either admit that you are not that character (and permanently lose the use of its power), or reveal that you are and win the game.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented as:&#10;&#10;    Die Erben von Hoax&#10;&#10;&#10;";1981;5.90022;1.3529;3;12;45;10;Bluffing, Deduction, Fantasy, Medieval
141;Andromeda;"Each player controls bases/stations (in the form of little wooden cubes) which they use to attempt to build Economic Centers on the moons of seven planets in an alien planetary system.  After moving their tokens on to a planet, players use an interesting little device ('planet ring'/'wormhole' - functions like a blind draw bag) to select one of the tokens on the planet.  Players take actions by collecting sets of cards which correspond to the the various planets.  The game also features a unique trading system which facilitates the card collecting. Careful card trading and calculating risk of establishing economic centers, and some variants, mitigate some of the luck factor.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;Setup: 9 cards/player. Place 1 cube per planet per player, plus additional cube per planet matching cards dealt out; remaining cubes on earth. Each gets 2 special action cards.Each round: First, players may play a single special action card, in order. Then, Trade Step. Finally, Action Step.&#10;&#10;Trade Step: Start player first plays cards (2-3) to offer, one at a time; other players simultaneously show cards to trade, different than offered. Start player must trade; recipient either accepts cards into hand, or leaves out. Clockwise from Start Player, next player with cards still in front of them either makes a trade or takes their cards back. Continue till 0-1 people left with cards in front; they take them back to hand.&#10;&#10;Action Step: Start player takes 3 actions, then others take 2 each. Actions can be:&#10;- discard 2 cards, then draw 2&#10;- turn in set of 3-7 cards to send half (rounding down) as many cubes from earth to a planet&#10;- turn in set of 3-7 cards to advance Ship Level, Tech Level, or to make attempt to establish colony on a planet matching cards played: place cubes on that planet into the cosmic ashtray, randomize, then reveal up to as many cubes as attempts made. If reveal your cube, place it on a station; turn over. If other player's cube, send it back to earth.&#10;- Sets: if no wilds (&quot;pure&quot;), take appropriate bonus wild card matching the size of the set (if available); wilds can be used later as parts of sets&#10;&#10;Then rotate starting player to the left. Game ends when all stations on 3 planets have been taken. Score VP shown on board (for Tech level, stations occupied, and cubes on earth). Most VP wins.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.38641;2.2248;3;5;60;10;Science Fiction, Space Exploration, Territory Building
143;Wortelboer;"In this very unusual card game, players are given equal stacks of cards, which have either carrots, bunnies, or foxes pictured on them.

145;Metropolis;"One of game designer Sid Sackson&#039;s greatest contributions to the negotiation genre, this game has players  trying to construct the best buildings in a rapidly growing city.  The map is a collection of city blocks broken into smaller properties.  Each turn, players choose one property and try to work out deal for placing a new structure on the board.  The value of each building is determined by the type of buildings in the same block, so both a school and an apartment building receive bonuses for existing together.&#10;&#10;";1984;6.36169;2.2353;2;5;90;16;City Building, Negotiation

Just as with real world energy companies, player will setup facilities for oil drilling, oil pumping, oil refining into gasoline, and gasoline selling to the consumer... all of which are represented by actual plastic pieces placed on the board!  Players also speculate by buying and selling oil and gasoline barrels in both the domestic and foreign markets... again represented by actual plastic barrels in their playing area!&#10;&#10;However, the changing economic climate, as well as sudden world news events, will challenge players to keep a long-term strategic view of the world energy markets.

151;Piratenbillard;"This interesting dexterity game is played on a table-like board that is a wooden lattice with a piece of linen stretched over the bottom.  Little colored balls are placed in the resulting holes, and then players use long wooden mallets to strike the bottom of the table.  When a ball is hit correctly, it will pop out of the space it's in and land in another space closer to the opposite side of the board.  Landing on another player's ball lets you capture it, but if your ball lands off the board, it's out of the game.&#10;&#10;";1989;6.55572;1.2414;2;4;15;8;Action / Dexterity, Pirates
153;Take 5!;"Relying heavily on his previous effort, 6 Nimmt!, Wolfgang Kramer has transformed it into a more strategic game.  The deck is numbered from 1 to 98, with some of the cards having green bullheads and others having red bullheads.  In this game greens are positive points and reds are negative points.  As in 6 Nimmt!, players are constructing sets of cards, with the fifth card in a set taking the whole thing.  This time, however, players take their turns sequentially and can play one to three cards from their hands.&#10;&#10;In a confusing twist, the Dutch edition of 6 Nimmt! is called Take 5! but is the progenitor game, not this game.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.55906;1.474;2;6;60;10;Card Game, Number
155;Was sticht?;"This is a two-trump, trick-taking card game, with several twists.  At the beginning of the game, players draft tasks they intend to complete in order to win the game.  (Tasks include things like &quot;Take no tricks&quot;, &quot;Take 1 Trick&quot;, or &quot;Take No Red Cards&quot;.)  Then, all of the cards are dealt out in front of the players before each hand.  Row by row, the players draft cards, and the dealer declares who would have won each row's trick, if it had been played that way.  Players use this information to deduce what the trump number and suit are.  After all the cards are drafted, each player - except the dealer - selects one of the task tiles she drafted, which will be her mission for the hand.  The dealer is stuck trying to uniquely accomplish someone else's task for the round - but at least doesn't have to preselect which person's goal he is trying to &quot;steal&quot;.  The hand is then played in the traditional fashion, with each player trying to take tricks or not, based on the goal she selected.  The first player to complete five tasks wins the game.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    M&#195;&#188; and Lots More&#10;&#10;&#10;";1993;6.98204;2.377;3;4;60;12;Card Game, Deduction
157;Eurorails;"Eurorails is another entry in the Mayfair Games crayon rail games, like Empire Builder and India Rails.  Its puzzle-piece board forms a map of Europe broken down into dots.  Players use different-colored crayons to draw rail from dot to dot, building their rail system.  A large deck of cards is used to determine how much money will be generated by picking up a particular commodity and delivering it to the listed city, with the payoffs being related to how far away the source is from the destination.  As players generate more money, they build successively larger and more comprehensive rail systems, hopefully connecting to almost all the major cities.  The goal of the game is to generate a set amount of money once you've linked all the major cities.&#10;&#10;";1990;7.09904;2.7432;2;6;240;10;Economic, Trains, Transportation

One plays the ship's crew, trying to kill the evil and rapidly multiplying aliens controlled by his opponent.  And although the crew members have several weapons available to them, they don't know what effect those weapons will have until they try using them in combat against the Awful Green Things.

After one of those words has been read aloud, players try to come up with definitions that at least sound plausible, because points are later awarded for every opposing player who guessed that your definition was the correct one.&#10;&#10;Versions of the game as a parlor game go back at least as far as 1970, although Balderdash itself was not published until 1984.&#10;&#10;Mattel, Inc. republished Balderdash in 2006 in a form that derives its gameplay from the sequel Beyond Balderdash.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Beyond Balderdash / Absolute Balderdash&#10;    Kokkelimonke Jubileum&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Beyond Balderdash*&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    In a peculiar situation, this game was reimplemented by Beyond/Absolute Balderdash and then combined back into the original title (Balderdash) but with the rules and cards from Beyond/Absolute; while Tactic re-published their version of Beyond/Absolute combined with the original Balderdash and called it Kokkelimonke Jubileum.&#10;&#10;&#10;";1984;6.47848;1.3977;2;6;60;12;Bluffing, Party Game, Word Game

In it, players take on the role of villains building their remote fortresses and capturing secret agents. When one is captured, he can be killed right away, but what's the fun in that? The real points come when you slowly reveal your secret plan to him &mdash; or leave him to be eaten by sharks. Of course, that's where the risk is, too, and the longer you postpone the kill, the greater the likelihood that another player will produce a card that allows the agent to escape and destroy your fortress.&#10;&#10;Reissued in color in 2004 as James Ernest's Totally Renamed Spy Game (with many more cards), then reissued again in 2016 as Before I Kill You, Mister Spy...&#10;&#10;";1996;5.43711;1.265;2;6;30;12;Card Game, Spies / Secret Agents

168;Empire Builder;"Epic Railroad Building in North America&#10;&#10;Discover a modern North American classic.  Celebrate one of our most vital and enduring passions: railroads.  Use your initial investment to build track.  Then pick up commodities where they are grown, mined, or manufactured and deliver them to a lucrative place of demand.  Complete a delivery and make the money you need to buy larger, faster trains, and expand your railroad empire.  Win the game by building the most effective railroad empire!&#10;&#10;The original and flagship of Mayfair&#039;s crayon-rails line allows players, using washable crayons, to draw their train routes over a map of North America.  Players start with an initial sum of money which they use to build short lengths of track during their first couple of turns.  For the rest of the game, players operate their trains over the track network drawn on the board to pick up and deliver loads to various cities, and then have the opportunity to add to their track network or improve their train.  The game uses demand cards which list three demands, each of a commodity to be delivered to a specified city for a given payoff.  Each player has three demand cards to provide opportunities for income.&#10;&#10;Each turn consists of an operations phase and a building phase.  During the operations phase, trains are moved to cities where commodities are picked up at no cost and moved to one of the cities on that player's demand cards.  When the commodity is delivered, the player receives the payoff and trades that demand card for a new one.  Event cards are mixed in the deck with the demand cards.  When an event card is drawn the instructions are followed.  During the building phase a player may pay to build more track or upgrade his train.&#10;&#10;A player wins by being the first to connect his track network to six of the seven major cities on the board and acquire $250,000,000 in cash on hand.&#10;&#10;";1982;6.96426;2.6318;2;6;180;12;Economic, Trains, Transportation

170;Family Business;"Family Business takes mob warfare to a new level of backstabbing, revenge, and general bloodthirstiness, which is what makes it such a blast to play.  Every player controls a 'family' and plays various cards to off other players' family members.  In a game with this little structure, it's possible for everyone to gang up on one unlucky soul, or for the damage to be fairly evenly spread.  Either way, the last family standing is victorious.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a gang of nine characters. To try to get rid of other gangsters, contracts are played on them. If these contracts are not blocked by anyone, the targeted gangster is placed on the hitlist. As soon as six gangsters are on the hitlist a mobwar is started. This means that, at the start of every turn, the first character on this list is eliminated. This goes on until the list is empty.&#10;&#10;Mobwars can also be triggered by cards being played. When no more than the last six or fewer characters are in play a constant mobwar is going on, until only one player has characters left.&#10;&#10;In general players take turns clockwise, however, the turn goes to any player who plays a response card and then clockwise mode is resumed with the player next to him/her. Lots of interaction as players play cards to put gangsters on the list, save them, have them replaced, start a Mob War, or stop it...&#10;&#10;";1982;6.07391;1.3187;2;6;30;8;Card Game, Mafia
171;Chess;"Chess is a two-player, abstract strategy board game that represents medieval warfare on an 8x8 board with alternating light and dark squares. Opposing pieces, traditionally designated White and Black, are initially lined up on either side of the board. Each type of piece has a unique form of movement and capturing occurs when a piece, via its movement, occupies the square of an opposing piece. Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture, attack, defend, or develop their positions. Chess games can end in checkmate (when the king cannot escape from the opponent's pieces), resignation (when one player recognizes that defeat is inevitable and ends the game), or one of several types of draws.&#10;&#10;Chess is one of the most popular games in the world, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. Between two highly skilled players, chess can be a beautiful thing to watch, and a game can provide great entertainment even for novices. The 2020 Netflix series, The Queen's Gambit was enjoyed by both chess players and non-players alike. There is also a large literature of books and periodicals about chess, typically featuring games and commentary by chess masters. Chess is so well known and highly regarded that it is often used as a metaphor in journalism, poetry, fiction, and film.&#10;&#10;Chess has its origins in the Indian game Chaturanga, which became Shatranj when introduced to the Persians. The current form of the game emerged in the second half of the 15th century when the Persians brought Shatranj to Southern Europe. The tradition of organized competitive chess began in the 16th century. The first official World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886. Chess is also a recognized sport of the International Olympic Committee.&#10;&#10;";1475;7.22674;3.6541;2;2;0;6;Abstract Strategy

175;What the Heck?;"Rarely is a game broken down to its barest elements like this one.  Players are given an equal deck of bidding cards from one to fifteen.  Each turn, a prize tile is randomly selected from a pool.  A prize tile is worth either positive or negative points (from -5 to +10).  Each player is attempting to gather the most positive points from these prizes.  Players secretly select one of their remaining bidding cards and reveal them simultaneously.  For positive prizes, the highest card gets the prize; For negative prizes, the lowest card is stuck with the prize.  However, if two people play the highest (or lowest) card, they cancel each other out and the prize goes to the next in line.  The highest total score after all fifteen prizes are awarded wins.&#10;&#10;";1988;6.48163;1.1636;2;5;20;7;Animals, Bluffing, Card Game
176;Give Me the Brain!;"Working in fast-food is hell.  All the employees are zombies, and you can't find a single brain amongst them.  Except for the brain part - there is, in fact, one brain - that's the premise of Give Me the Brain!, a card game in which players take on the roles of zombies in a fast-food restaurant in hell.  They all have to complete a number of tasks before leaving work, and the work keeps piling on.  Even worse, some of the tasks require basic intelligence and there's only one brain to go around.&#10;&#10;Note: Give Me the Brain: Superdeluxe Edition has 100 cards, instead of 112 with a few cards adjusted from previous versions.&#10;&#10;";1996;5.83541;1.2727;3;8;15;10;Card Game, Zombies
177;Advanced Civilization;"The use of the word &quot;Advanced&quot; to describe this expansion followed existing Avalon Hill tradition. &quot;Enhanced&quot; is likely more appropriate.  Playing with this expansion is no more difficult than playing the base Civilization game.  This expansion reworks a few of the original rules, includes a reworked version of Civilization: Expansion Trade Cards Set and adds more civilization advancements to the technology tree.&#10;&#10;Included are more civilization advancements (both quantity and type), which give the players new options for advancement, as well as a slightly restructured commodity trading round, which has new resources and disasters to be traded. The most significant aspect of the game is a restructuring of the advancement/victory conditions, which remove the limits on advancement cards.  Some claim this makes the strategies more homogeneous while others claim the reverse is true.&#10;&#10;";1991;8.00796;3.6651;2;8;480;12;Ancient, Civilization, Economic, Expansion for Base-game, Negotiation
178;Mole Hill;"In this strange little game, players take the roles of a gardener protecting his lawn and a mole digging it up.  The gardener must try to block the mole's moves and fence him in quickly, while the mole must dig as many holes as possible before being caught.&#10;&#10;Essentially, the mole may move any direction, horizontally or diagonally from square to square, while the gardener places boundary sticks down along the edges of the square, which the mole may not cross.  The mole and gardener may either move or place down a boundary stick, and move alternately.  Eventually, the gardener will hem the mole in completely and the round is over.  In addition, if the mole can move into flower beds, extra points are scored.  By moving to the center, the mole may also tunnel deeply to any selected square on the board, thus escaping the (by then) rapidly closing trap of boundary sticks.  Depending on how many moves this took, more or less points are earned by the mole.&#10;&#10;Once points are totaled up, the roles are reversed and another round is played.  The winner is the player who scored the most points as the mole.&#10;&#10;";1997;5.99224;1.7188;2;2;15;8;Abstract Strategy
179;Nuba;"The board is a 5 x 6 grid. Each player has ten tokens, numbered 1 - 9 and one 'X'. Players alternate setting their pieces in the two rows nearest them. The lower the number on the token, the better a wrestler that piece is. The higher the number, the better the musician (but that makes that piece a lousy wrestler). The idea is to get your highest possible piece to the opposite side of the board.&#10;&#10;When a piece successfully reaches the opposite side of the board, it is placed in the honorable musician space. It remains there unless another piece (of either player) with a higher value reaches the opposite side, in which case it supplants this piece as the best musician. The game ends when no one can oust the reigning musician (which means no one has a piece left on the board of a higher value). If a player's piece marked with the 'X' reaches the opposite side, the game immediately ends and that player is victorious.&#10;&#10;A variant is given in which all pieces which cross the board are summed to determine the winner, although a player exiting their 'X' still wins immediately.&#10;&#10;The original magazine publication also suggests playing on a 6x6 board with additional '10' and '11' pieces.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.20585;2.0;2;2;10;12;Abstract Strategy
180;Pool Position;"The setting is pool side at a swanky hotel and players are trying to get their beach towels into the choice locations next to the pool.  Players use equal sets of power cards to determine the number of placement points for each round.  These movement points are then used to place their towels or dislodge others' towels.  However activity in a particular row of towels attracts the attention of the cabana boys, who can eventually lock a row up permanently.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.77071;1.7273;2;5;30;10;Abstract Strategy, Card Game
181;Risk;"Possibly the most popular, mass market war game.  The goal is conquest of the world.&#10;&#10;Each player's turn consists of:&#10;- gaining reinforcements through number of territories held, control of every territory on each continent, and turning sets of bonus cards.&#10;-  Attacking other players using a simple combat rule of comparing the highest dice rolled for each side.  Players may attack as often as desired.  If one enemy territory is successfully taken, the player is awarded with a  bonus card.&#10;-  Moving a group of armies to another adjacent territory.&#10;&#10;";1959;5.60099;2.0646;2;6;120;10;Territory Building, Wargame
182;Hungry;"In this quick, fun, and fairly abstract game, players play cards in an effort to acquire tiles that are either color-coded or number-coded.  Players take turns, first playing a card onto a tile that matches either the card's number or its color, then drawing to refill their hands.  When all cards have been played, each tile is evaluated, and whichever player has the most cards played to that tile gets that tile's points.  After calculating point totals and figuring in bonuses, the player with the highest score is the winner.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.36164;1.4239;2;4;30;8;Card Game, Medieval
183;Stonehenge;"Stonehenge is a two-player game that has druids competing at Stonehenge to be the Master Druid.&#10;&#10;Each player has 8 coloured megaliths (tall wooden blocks) and 9 matching discs (numbered 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,5, &amp; 6). The board is a triangle of 5 dissecting lines, with the corners lopped off, so the lines are 2,3,4,5,4 spaces long. On each side are 5 extra spaces, where players put their megaliths.&#10;&#10;Players take turns putting down a numbered disc on the intersections of the lines on the board. When you have the majority total in any direction, you claim that line by placing your megalith on the end point. Ties on a line are lost by the last placing player; a clever balancing rule which forces careful choices. The player to get their eighth megalith down wins.&#10;&#10;Stonehenge is the same as Linea (Spielbox 1992, smaller board).&#10;&#10;The Megalith edition is Selection #9 of The Games Collection by Pin International.&#10;&#10;";1994;6.29456;1.8571;2;2;15;10;Abstract Strategy
185;Devil Bunny Needs a Ham;"In this wacky Cheapass title, players are Sous Chefs trying to get to the top floor of a skyscraper by scaling the outside.  However the maniacal Devil Bunny is hopping about in a mad lust for blood thinking he'll get a ham by knocking you off.  Yeah, right, whatever.&#10;&#10;The game board is a rectangular grid representing the side of a building, with the starting space at the bottom, and the goal at the top. There is a dotted line near the top that represents a critical height (see below). Furthermore, there are special spaces on the sides of the buildings that represent &quot;fear&quot; that cannot be moved into (As a show of Cheapass Games' signature humor, these fears included &quot;spiders&quot; and &quot;Wesley Snipes.&quot;)&#10;&#10;In the basic game, each player controls two sous-chefs; on each turn, the player rolls two six-sided dice. Any roll other than a 6 can be used to move one or both sous-chefs up the side of the building, either horizontally or on upwards diagonals (a player cannot voluntarily move down the building). If a 6 is rolled, the Devil Bunny token is moved to the highest sous-chef on the board and knocks him off; if there is a sous-chef vertically below the one that was knocked off, the player controlling that one may opt to catch the falling sous-chef, placing the token in the spaces immediately below him. If no player that is able to catch the sous chef offers to help, the chef will crash to the ground. If the chef fell from a height below the marked line on the board, the chef is safe but must restart him climb back from the start. However, if the chef was above this line, the chef is dead, leaving the player with one fewer token to win. The players earn points for the order in which their chefs arrive at the top, and the weighting is such that a player with second and third-place chefs can beat a player with a first-place and a dead (non-scoring) chef.&#10;&#10;Variants include ignoring the effects of the fear spaces (which normally cluster the players into the center columns), and using 3 sous-chef tokens for each player.&#10;&#10;In 2022, Greater Than Games created a boxed edition with upgraded components.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.39836;1.1757;2;5;30;8;Abstract Strategy, Dice, Print & Play
186;Split;"Newer version of SPLIT is now available. Publisher is GDC-GameDevCo Ltd. The game still features the patented SPLIT half cards and looks much better than the original (design wise) and seems to have some adjustments to the rules.&#10;&#10;In this surprisingly solid offering from Hasbro, players use cards to take actions on a board.  The cards depict halves of a standard deck of cards, and players attempt to match the halves with those next to the board.  Depending on the quality of the match (perfect, strong, weak), the action is likewise powerful or weak.  The object of the game is to place a series of your markers in a continuous line across the board.  Also the game is scalable for two to six players, with four through six using partners to keep the action interesting.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented as:&#10;&#10;    Split (Revised Edition)&#10;&#10;&#10;";1999;5.93023;1.1333;2;6;30;12;Card Game

But once its basic rules are understood,Go shows its staggering depth. One can see why many people say it's one of the most elegant brain-burning abstract games in history.&#10;&#10;Players place one stone at a time on the board at an empty intersection. The goal of the game is to try to claim the most territory by walling off sections of the board and surrounding or capturing each other's stones.  The game doesn't end until the board fills up, or, more often, when both players agree to end it, at which time whoever controls the most territory wins.&#10;&#10;";-2200;7.65578;3.9253;2;2;180;8;Abstract Strategy
189;Die Siedler von Nürnberg;"Based on the well-known Settlers of Catan, this stand-alone game published in commemoration of the anniversary of the founding of the city of N&uuml;rnberg gives players some new twists to the familiar experience.  Unlike standard Settlers, the game layout is not modular.  Instead the board features a split map, half of which has the goods-producing hexes of a conventional Settlers game where settlements will be built and the other half showing a closeup of N&uuml;rnberg where &quot;workshops&quot; will be built (in lieu of promoting settlements to cities as in the original Settlers).  The players also get currency for manufactured goods which in turn they spend on walls and towers to surround the city, which earn prestige points which ultimately count toward victory points.  Probably the most interesting other detail is that instead of rolling dice, a special deck of cards is used to reveal the production number -- and possibly an event -- at the beginning of each player's turn.&#10;&#10;Belongs to the Catan Series.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.90314;2.7792;3;4;90;10;Medieval, Negotiation

A number of luxuries (boats, mansions, watches, boats, etc.) of values varying from one million to seven million are laid out in a matrix.  Players take turn placing power cards in the columns, and after five of the six cards have been played, the highest bid takes the first luxury in the column, the second highest gets the next one up, and so on.  However, if you collect a second luxury item you already own, then the newest one replaces the older one, which could mean exchanging a lavish seven million dollar car for a paltry one million dollar one!

If you want, you can roll the remaining dice &ndash; but if none of those dice score for you, you lose all points accumulated that round! Your challenge is further complicated by a deck of cards that determines what goal you might be forced to shoot for during that turn. Some goal cards dangle the prospect of huge bonuses, while others slam the door on you, ending your turn before it starts.&#10;&#10;Other than the deck of cards that push goals on players, Fill or Bust is similar to Farkle.&#10;&#10;";1981;5.80382;1.1489;2;10;30;8;Dice

The main thing going on is that you roll the five dice on your turn and pick which three you want to play.  Each die has the five colors for the five cars in the race and one &quot;checkered flag&quot; side which means you draw a card.  The dice are numbered 1 to 5 (that is, each die has one of the five numbers), and the three you pick have to be played in order.  If you draw a card, it might instruct you to move a particular car, or the car in last place, or to spin a car out; or it might make you a &quot;Sponsor&quot; of a car, meaning you could get prize money for a car other than your main car.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.515;1.1;2;5;30;8;Dice, Racing, Sports
196;Kremlin;"A game of political intrigue set in the Soviet Politburo of the early 20th century, with a satirical edge.  With politicians like Eduard Boremtodev, Nikolai Shootemdedsky and Natasha Nogoodnik vying for control of the party, you know the battle will be an entertaining one.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, a number of politician cards are laid out to fill the positions of the politburo.  Players then secretly note influence on ten politicians they hope to control during the game, indicated by a number from 1 to 10.&#10;Gameplay is not clockwise, but proceeds phase by phase with the politician holding the relevant office performing the appropriate action by the player who reveals the greatest influence on the politician in question.  Players attempt to remove politicians opposed to their interests by purging, exiling them to Siberia or by demoting them within the Politburo.  One&rsquo;s own preferred politicians can be promoted or pardoned of their previous &lsquo;sins&rsquo;. &#10;But each action a politician takes causes him (or in one case, her) to age by one or more years (a measure of the aging effect of the stress of the job). Each turn, politburo members face a health check which can result in the politician becoming ill, or even dying.  The 'older' a politician gets the more likely it is that he (or she) will become ill.&#10;At the end of each turn, the Party Chief must be healthy enough to wave to the crowd at the October parade. Controlling a politician who succeeds at this three times makes you the winner.&#10;&#10;The original Fata Morgana edition included rules requiring the players to hold funeral speeches for deceased party chairmen and drinking vodka with it, for instance. The later Avalon Hill edition scrapped these rules and gave the game a less satirical and more serious tone.&#10;&#10;Jolly Roger reimplemented an edition providing three different KREMLIN games in one box -See Kremlin (Third Edition)-:&#10;&#10;1: The 'original' with fictional politicians, set in a USSR where KGB investigations send those found guilty to Siberia. This version will have victory conditions based on the original Fata Morgana rules.&#10;&#10;2: A version inspired by the Avalon Hill variant titled 'Revolution'. Set in the 1920s, it uses historical politicians as well as fictional politicians. It's a more violent game as those arrested by the KGB are shot and removed from the game&#10;&#10;3: A new version, set in the modern USSR and Russia, an era of entrenched bureaucracy and alternatives for escaping KGB persecution. This version introduces the concept of &quot;Going into Exile&quot; to avoid Siberia. It also includes modern politicians from the 1960s onwards, whether it is Kosygin or Putin and Gorbachev.&#10;&#10;";1986;6.96878;2.8493;3;6;75;12;Negotiation, Political

The card mechanics are clever, as every card can become a load to be delivered, or be used to build rail, move trains, or draw more cards.

Ultimately, each player seeks to have built the tallest buildings in the most city blocks of the Island.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players will play a card that illustrates which part of a city block they may place a &quot;floor&quot; on a building. The placement card is unique for each player in that the section they may place in is relative to their seating at the table. The player who has placed the top most floor controls that building. Each round, scores are tallied based on control of each of the neighborhoods.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the player who has scored the most points through area control and tallest buildings wins.&#10;&#10;Note: In the Finnish edition, the districts are named after six great cities of the world: Hong Kong, Sao Paulo, Cairo, Sydney, Frankfurt and Manhattan.&#10;&#10;(Espa&ntilde;ol)&#10;&#10;En Manhattan los jugadores construyen un 'skyline' de rascacielos en distintos distritos o zonas de la isla de Manhattan.

Tiles are drawn and placed on squares on the board. As the tiles are placed islands develop on the board and players pay to place settlements, bases, or scouts on these islands in an effort to become the most powerful discoverer of all.

201;The Rose King;"Originally published as Texas by db-Spiele.&#10;&#10;The battle between farmers and ranchers is fairly abstract. A single pawn travels on a square grid. Each player has a hand of cards face up. These each have a direction and a distance. The player can either draw a card and add it to his hand, or play a card. If he plays a card, then the pawn moves the appropriate distance to an empty square, and the player places one of his markers. Each player also has judge symbols that can each be used only once. The judge lets you move onto a previously placed opposition marker and reverse it. Players score points for each contiguous region equal to the square of the number of markers. If a player is not careful, such a move may be forced, as there is a maximum number of cards that a player may hold.&#10;&#10;Contains rules for playing with 4 (in two partnerships of two players).&#10;&#10;Later republished 1999 as Rosenk&ouml;nig by Kosmos, as part of the two-player game series. The republication also included a re-theming of the game. The setting changed from Texas to England, and the factions changed from farmers and ranchers to the factions of the Plantagenet family from the Wars of the Roses (1455-1485) - the Lancaster (red rose) and the York (white rose) factions in a similarly abstracted fashion.&#10;&#10;Rosenk&ouml;nig is part of the Kosmos two-player series.&#10;&#10;";1992;6.81552;1.9375;2;2;30;10;Abstract Strategy, Medieval
202;Targui;"Conquer and occupy the valuable desert grounds. And also keep your home village! By tactically moving groups of camels through the different desert grounds and by using its specialties you can rule the desert. -- from the rulebook&#10;&#10;Targui has a board made of large square tiles representing the different types of desert ground. These provide varying economic and strategic value, from 0-5, and with a salt mine in the center, random distribution (with a little tinkering) makes a varied map each game. Players have a village tile which they place on the outer edge, and start with some camels and money. Your turn simply consists of moving and buying camels, expanding your control of the land.&#10;&#10;Targui has very simple mechanisms, and is in effect a simple rolling war game with obvious tactics. But the random turn order creates a wonderful world of rapidly shifting alliances, with players making and breaking promises within moments. The winner is not the one with most money or camels, but with the most economic value under their control.&#10;&#10;The game plays nicely with 3 or 4 players. However, Targui is a long game. Eight rounds takes about three hours, so using the whole deck of 20 fortune cards makes for an over-long game. If you enjoy Risk or light wargaming, then you'll get a lot from Targui.&#10;&#10;";1988;6.40073;2.3871;2;4;120;12;Arabian, Wargame

206;Jalape-NO!;"Jalape-NO!, first released as Pepper, is a trick-taking game in which you want to dodge the spiciness to end up with the lowest score possible.&#10;&#10;The deck consists of 108 cards (102 number cards and 6 pepper cards), with cards being numbered 1-18 in six colors and with the 1s being peppers. Based on the player count, you use 4-6 colors of cards ranging from 1-9 to 1-18.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, you receive 12 cards in hand, and you must place any peppers on the table in front of you. The lead player in a trick plays any card from their hand or one of their peppers. Each other player must follow suit, if possible, except that you are not forced to play the matching pepper card, should you have it. (However, if you do have it, you cannot play a pepper of another color to this trick.) Whoever plays the highest card in the suit led wins the trick and leads the next trick. If you win a pepper in a trick, place it on the table in front of you; you can play this pepper on a future trick, whether to lead off the trick or to play it on a trick that's already in progress.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player has no cards in hand, the round ends. All players add any cards in hand to the cards in front of them, whether peppers or cards claimed in tricks. Each pepper you have is worth 2 points, and each card in the same suit as a pepper you have is worth 1 point. After five rounds, the player with the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.23529;1.4;3;9;45;10;Card Game
207;Twitch;"Twitch is an insanely frantic game of reacting to new information.  When someone plays a card, you must quickly determine if it points to you (e.g., if the player to your right plays a card that says &quot;left&quot;), and if it does, throw the top card of your deck onto the pile.  If you're not quick enough, another player will call you out, and you'll have to take all the cards in the pile into your deck.  The first person to run her deck out wins.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.10757;1.1667;3;6;15;10;Action / Dexterity, Card Game
208;Ex & Hopp;"A quick and simple card game for 2-6 milk-drinking players. Each player places a color card down as their marker and the matching sets of cards numbered 1-12 in those colors make up the deck. The deck is shuffled and players get 4 cards, the remainder goes down as a draw deck. There is a set of small tiles in red and black for negative or positive points (red are 4,4,5,5,6,6, black are 2,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,6,6,6). These are shuffled face down and 4 turned up to start 4 rows.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you can place a card against a row or try to swap a card with another player. If you want to swap, you simply offer a color for another color, mentioning no numbers. Swap with the player of your choice, but if nobody wants to swap, you've wasted your turn.&#10;&#10;When you play a card to a row, you draw back so you have 4 cards. When the row is full, determined by the number on the tile, the player with the highest total in the cards has to take the tile, be it positive or negative. Usually your choices are obvious, but sometimes it is worth assisting another player to take a row, rather than waste a good card for you on a low or negative tile. If a row is tied between players, the cards are discarded and the tile stays for more cards.&#10;&#10;The discard deck is shuffled over, taken tiles refreshed by new ones. The game ends when the tiles are all taken, deduct the negative from the positive to get your score.&#10;&#10;This game was re-themed and expanded on with Relikt.&#10;&#10;";1996;5.48116;1.1667;2;6;30;10;Card Game
210;Don Pepe;"In this twisted little game, players take control of a gang of mobsters that are dedicated to extorting money out of businesses and rubbing out the competing mobs in the process.  All of the gang members are placed around an oblong table, with some of the places indicating certain benefits.  If a place has a picture of a business, then the player makes money until the mobster is killed or moved.  If the place has a gun, then he can use it to shoot a mobster across the table.  If a place has a knife, then he can use it to stab someone seated next to him.  Plus, some of the mobsters have the ability to kill others all the time by carrying their own knives and guns.  The game ends when all the available money is taken, and the largest pile of cash takes the game.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.28435;1.2903;3;6;30;8;Card Game, Economic, Mafia
211;Times to Remember;"In Times to Remember, the players are trying to remember particular times. Is that clear enough? No? Okay, here are more details.&#10;&#10;Players aren't trying to remember times from their own lives, but rather times from the shared experiences of humanity as a whole. Each player or team starts the game with a set of brackets or tokens (depending on the version of the game), and the first player to rid herself of brackets wins.&#10;&#10;On a turn, all players are confronted with a trivia question, say, &quot;When did the first Star Wars arrive in theaters?&quot; Each player then uses one bracket to mark a particular year or series of years on her individual year chart. Once everyone has placed their answers, the questioner reveals the answer and everyone sees whether that year appears in the range they guessed. If so, they remove that bracket from the game; if not, they keep the bracket. No matter how much you might want to hedge your guesses, eventually you'll need to guess a year dead on, so plumb the depths of your memory and take your best shot!&#10;&#10;";1992;6.30012;1.125;2;10;45;10;Party Game, Trivia
214;Café International;"This game revolves around the placement of multi-national customers in a restaurant. The board shows many different tables, each with four chairs around them. The tables are grouped by nation, so the Chinese like to sit with other Chinese. However, some of the chairs are on the border between two nations, so a person from either place could occupy the seat. To further complicate this odd tile game, each of the people is either male or female, and tables must be gender-balanced.  As the game progresses some tiles become unplayable...&#10;&#10;";1989;6.22085;1.6422;2;4;60;10;Abstract Strategy
215;Tichu;"Tichu took much of its rules and mechanics from Zheng Fen. It is a partnership climbing card game, and the object of play is to rid yourself of your hand, preferably while scoring points in the process.&#10;&#10;The deck is a standard 52-card pack with four special cards added: dog, phoenix, dragon and Mah Jong (1). When it's your turn, you may either beat the current top card combination &mdash; single card, pair of cards, sequence of pairs, full house, etc. &mdash; or pass. If play passes all the way back to the player who laid the top cards, they win the trick, clears the cards, and can lead the next one. The card led determines the only combination of cards that can be played on that trick, so if a single card is led, then only single cards are played; if a straight of seven cards is led, then only straights of seven cards can be played, etc.&#10;&#10;The last player out in a round gives all the cards they won to the player who exited first, and the last player's unplayed cards are handed to the opposite team. Fives, tens and Kings are worth 5, 10 and 10 points, with each hand worth one hundred points without bonuses &mdash; but the bonuses are what drive the game. At the start of a round, each player can call &quot;Tichu&quot; prior to playing any card. This indicates that the player thinks they can empty their hand first this round; if they do so, their team scores 100 points, and if not, their team instead loses 100 points. Cards are dealt at the start of a round in a group of eight and a group of six; a player can call &quot;Grand Tichu&quot; after looking at only their first eight cards for a &plusmn;200 point bonus. If both players on a team exit a round prior to either player on the opposite team, then no points are scored for cards and the winning team earns 200 points (with Tichu/Grand Tichu bonuses and penalties being applied as normal).&#10;&#10;The first team to 1,000 points wins.&#10;&#10;";1991;7.57542;2.3385;4;4;60;10;Card Game
216;Atlanteon;"The original edition, titled Revolution, is set in French Revolution-era Paris. Royalists and Jacobins fight for superiority in the 25 city districts, which are represented by the game board. The two players alternately place one of their counters in order to control that space. When a player puts one of his number counters on the board, he projects influence onto the neighboring spaces in that row and column, and onto the space the counter itself is on. The amount of the influence corresponds to the number on the counter. Whoever controls all three of the buildings or controls eleven city districts has won the game.&#10;&#10;The game was later reprinted as Atlanteon, in which mighty undersea warriors fight to control the capital of the Sunken Kingdoms. One player controls the vicious Marauders, who are trying to capture the city, while the other player controls the heroic Guardians, who are trying to defend their home.&#10;&#10;";1992;5.84261;2.026;2;2;30;12;Abstract Strategy, Napoleonic
217;A la carte;"In one of his sillier games, Karl-Heinz Schmiel casts the players as semi-psychotic cooks attempting to hone their culinary skills. Each player receives a miniature pan and a hotplate. Then each turn you can either attempt to turn up the heat, season your dish, or attempt to steal another cook's recipe in the making. Heating your hotplate is a random affair with a die, and could raise the heat on everyone's plate. Spicing the dish is heart of the game and done by up-ending small bottles filled with little colored wood pellets. When the pellets tumble out of the bottle (sometimes, if they do), the number of pellets can't exceed two, because over-spicing the dish ruins it and you have to throw it in the trash!&#10;&#10;The 2009 version includes some changed rules, a new victory condition, additional recipes and some new mechanics in comparison to the 1989 version.&#10;&#10;";1989;6.45804;1.2932;2;4;30;8;Action / Dexterity
219;Volle Hütte;"Players take on the role of club-owners vying for customers' Deutsch Marks in this unique board game, called Full House in German.&#10;&#10;Each player is given a small board representing their cafe or pub. In your turn, you can either place a tile in your pub, representing different types of seating (bar, patio, formal) &amp; activities (dancing, shooting pool, playing fooseball), or you can select a customer card, to draw in customers to those specific tiles, if you have the seating available. A third choice is to take a Billing card, which gives you a tip in cash money, and makes all customers in all the players bars pay their bills too. Yellow customers are worth 10 DM, red 20 DM and blue customers pay 30 DM.&#10;&#10;When there are at least ten customers floating around, players can also spend a Action card which moves customers around. The cards either move off a specific tile type to a type you choose, or from a tile type you choose to a specific tile. So you might move customers specifically from the terrace seating to any other type of your choice (such as the disco floor), or from a tile of your choice (such as the bar) to specifically a Pool Table. The cards allow from 1-4 customers to move, depending on the tiles.&#10;&#10;This is the clever part. As the customers move, they normally pay their bill, unless the Action card shows a No Pay symbol, making them bill-dodgers. When customers move, they first look for a suitable spot within the same pub! Only if they can't find one (either it lacks that type of tile, or there isn't enough room to accommodate them), do they then start wandering clockwise to the next pub, and keep going until they find a suitable spot. If they can't, they leave the game.&#10;&#10;So if you have an Action card that pays a bill, and you have the right empty spaces in your bar (because you've carefully put in a variety of attractions), you move your customers around inside your bar and collect the money (&quot;Hey, we're paying our bar tab now, we're gonna shoot some Pool&quot;). If you have a suitable Action card with a No Pay symbol, you move customers from another player's bar into yours (&quot;This place stinks guys, let's skip out and find a Fooseball!&quot;). It is this clever management of customers that will net you big profits.&#10;&#10;And if your bar is pretty full, especially with blue and red customers, you call a billing as your first action. The other players also collect, but you should have a margin on them, plus the tip (from 30-70 DM).&#10;&#10;There are always three Customer cards and three Action cards face up, and two fresh tiles, so you should be able to make good choices and plan ahead a little. The game ends when the Action cards or the Billing cards are exhausted.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player with the most money, having milked the punters as much as possible.&#10;&#10;";1997;6.17446;2.0909;3;5;30;12;Economic
221;Ikusa;"Shogun / Samurai Swords is the last game in the original Milton Bradley Gamemaster series. It was later rereleased by HAH under the name Ikusa. The game focuses on the chaotic feudal society of Japan during the Middle Ages. Players play one of several factions that erupt into a civil war, trying to consolidate their strongholds and then defeat other armies for the right to be called Shogun, the supreme ruler.&#10;&#10;In the game, players command forces on islands of feudal Japan.  Player forces include provincial forces in the provinces and mobile armies commanded by daimyos.  In each turn, players will allocate their koku into bids and purchases for the round.  The round begins with the allocation of turn order, which is determined by bid, and in the case of tied bids, by player agreement or random draw.  Then players other bids and payments are accounted for in purchases of castles and fortresses, drafting of new troops and ronin, and a bid for the lone ninja.  Following the bids phase, players in turn order plan and execute attacks against enemy territories, with attacks resolved through die rolls.  A player wins the game when he or she has captured a certain number of territories, either via straight conquest or by vanquishing the last of an opponent's diamyos and taking over that player's forces.&#10;&#10;The game was originally published as Shogun and was later changed to Samurai Swords due to a name conflict with James Clavell&#039;s Shogun. Ikusa is the latest iteration of the game.&#10;&#10;Winner of 1988 Origins Awards:&#10;&#10;     Best Pre-20th Century Board Game&#10;     Best Graphic Presentation of a Board Game&#10;&#10;&#10;";1986;7.02952;2.9544;2;5;360;12;Civil War, Medieval, Territory Building, Wargame
222;Space Beans;"This game is a successor to the popular Bohnanza but is less complex and is not based on trading.&#10;&#10;Players attempt to collect 30 points in &quot;trophies&quot; to win the game. This is accomplished by working with up to two collections of space beans - 1 public (face-up) and 1 secret (face-down).&#10;&#10;The primary mechanic is drawing beans, placing them in one of your collections (public or secret) if you have any matching cards to play, then passing your entire hand to the player on your right. If you compile a collection that contains a number of beans equal to the number value on one of beans in the collection, you may redeem the collection for the same amount of points on that card.&#10;&#10;For example: If a player has three violet beans, and one of them has a value of 3, that collection can be converted for three trophy points. The card numbered 3 would go into the trophy pile, and the other cards into the discard pile.&#10;&#10;Space Beans is part of the Bohnanza family of games.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.08904;1.3833;2;6;40;10;Card Game, Science Fiction

The board shows a map of the world with many different branching paths, and players advance the expeditions by placing plastic arrows. When an expedition arrives at a location that matches one of your private site cards or one of the public site cards, you score that card. Certain spaces on the board allow you to play again immediately, and other spaces allow you to pick up a bonus action card that you can play at any time on one of your turns.&#10;&#10;The game ends when someone has scored all of their cards, then whoever has the highest total score wins.&#10;&#10;";1996;6.73042;1.9771;2;6;45;8;Adventure, Educational, Exploration, Transportation, Travel
224;History of the World;"History of the World works under the assumptions that all empires eventually fade and that the only things differentiating great empires from lesser ones is how much territory they conquer and how long it takes for their civilizations to disappear.  The game is played out over 7 epochs or rounds, from the ancient 3000 B.C. Sumerians to the pre-WW1 Germany, with every player controlling a new rising empire from history.  Some empires are stronger than others (like the Romans), but the game's clever mechanisms can help balance that out.  At the end of each epoch, players score points for all units of their color (from both the current and any previous empires) remaining on the board.&#10;&#10;Before the start of their turn a player may play up to two Event cards from their hand.  The Events played are resolved before the player starts his Empire's actions.  If the player's active Empire has navigation a ship token is placed in each sea or ocean listed (if an ocean is listed all adjacent seas to the ocean have ship markers put into them).  A Reallocation Greater Event allows an Empire with Navigation to exchange Fleets in seas and oceans for Coins that can be used to buy back defeated troops (1 coin per troop).  If the active Empire has a capitol it is taken and placed in the Empire's starting land with one unit of the Empire's available troops.  Since each land space may only contain one troop the player begins expanding from their starting land by placing troops in any adjacent land space that they wish to occupy or conquer.  To conquer a land the attacker moves one unit into the land space either from adjacent land or through a sea with a ship in it.  Then dice are rolled, the attacker gets 2 dice and the defender only one, unless the attacker traveled across a strait or the defender's land has either a forest, the great wall of China, or mountains on the border of the land that the attacker came from.  In this case the defender receives 2 dice as well.  If the attack comes from the sea the defender gets 3 dice for defense.  Highest score wins with ties killing off both the defender and attacker.  In this case the attacker can merely place the next troop, if he has any left, in the now-empty land space.&#10;&#10;At any time the active Empire player may exchange an unplaced troop for a fort.  On later turns, a fort gives the player a +1 to defensive rolls in that land.  Also, if the defender in a fort loses or ties with an attacker only the fort is removed and the battle continues.  Whenever an army conquers a land with a capitol the capitol mini is flipped reducing it to a city (if it was a city to begin with it is removed from board when conquered).  After the active player's Empire is finished with it's actions check to see if it conquered to land spaces with resource symbols, if so it can build a monument.&#10;&#10;Then scoring takes place.  Each area (Middle-East, Northern Europe, Eurasia, etc...) has a tile with 3 values for the current Epoch.  One value is for having a presence in the area (at least one land).  Another value is for having Dominance in the area (at least 2 lands and more than any other player in area). The last value is for having Control of an area (at least 3 lands and no other player has any in area).  These values vary from Epoch to Epoch and Area to Area (Middle-East is more valuable in early Epochs and fades in later Epochs, for example).  Total the scores from each area for all pieces of the player's color from all Empires controlled that remain on board.  Then add 2 points for each capitol controlled, 1 point per city and one point for each monument controlled. After all areas are scored the next Empire called takes its turn.&#10;&#10;After all players have taken their turns and scored, for the first Epoch, the player with the highest score gets to take a pre-eminence marker and places it in front of him.  These are secret bonus points (worth somewhere from 3 to 6) for the end of the game and may not be examined till then.  This bonus to leader helps balance the Empire-draw mechanic and makes it valuable to score maximal points even early in the game, rather than tanking to get a better draw later. Then drawing begins for the next Epoch with the player having the lowest score drawing first on up to the person with the highest score drawing last (and likely being given a less than optimal Empire by another player).&#10;&#10;After the last player has scored for Epoch 7 and the leader has drawn a pre-eminence marker, all players reveal their pre-eminence markers and add them to their scores.  The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;";1991;7.11455;2.766;3;6;270;12;Civilization, Ancient, Medieval, Napoleonic, Post-Napoleonic, Renaissance, Wargame, World War I

226;Isi;"Isi is a colorful abstract strategy game played on two levels.  On a basic level, each player is moving a pawn around the island of Isi, picking up tokens - there's a little strategy here, because which tokens you pick up are important, and one player's pawn can interfere with the other's.  But on another level, players are spending those tokens to build 'trade routes' between cities on the same island.  Cities grow as they become connected by trade routes, and at the end of the game whichever city's grown the most becomes the capital city; whoever is connected the most to the capital wins the game.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Morisi&#10;&#10;&#10;";1999;6.58333;0.0;2;2;30;12;Abstract Strategy

230;Merchant of Venus;"Merchant of Venus makes players take on the roles of space traders chasing wealth and fortune. Each player moves their ship through interconnected systems on a fixed map, discovering new alien worlds to trade with. As players start to make money delivering commodities, their earnings can be used to purchase equipment and construct their own infrastructure. The player who first acquires enough total value in cash and port/factory deeds wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game uses a basic roll-and-move mechanism for movement, but modifies it with engine ship upgrades that let the players skip certain spaces during movement. When players reach cities and spaceports, they can buy and sell commodities. Different species are randomly distributed throughout the universe at the start of the game, and players will only uncover which species lives where through exploration in the course of the game - the layout of which species lives where works to offset the rigidity of the fixed map by making different routes through the map profitable each game.&#10;&#10;The prices a player receives for selling their cargo is determined by the species that lives in the system, and what commodities a port offers for purchase is determined by a unique and dynamic supply-and-demand mechanism. With their money, players can replace their spaceships with better models, or build factories (which create better commodities) and spaceports (which speed up trading). They can also buy upgrades for their ships (like shields, lasers, or engines).&#10;&#10;Variations included in the rulebook allow for interplayer combat and solo play, and the exact target wealth players have to acquire in order to win is decided on before each play.&#10;&#10;";1988;7.13279;2.8327;1;6;180;12;Economic, Exploration, Science Fiction, Space Exploration, Transportation
231;Geronimo;"The U.S. - Indian conflicts, a tragic period of history.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players are randomly assigned a side to play -- either Indian tribes or the U.S. Only one player represents the U.S. each turn, while the other players each have a number of Indian tribes under their control. Indian players get to select one or two of their active tribes, but the rest are dealt to them randomly. There are usually more Indian tribes available than what are active each turn, but players don't really know which ones are inactive.  This can be unsettling to the U.S. player as he must decide where to deploy his limited troops and columns.&#10;&#10;All players compete to earn victory points.  The U.S. player is faced with the task of building up sufficient resources (settlements, towns, railroads, mines, etc.) to maintain existing states and convert territories into states. The Indian players play the role of guerrillas to earn victory points, but also can deny resources to the U.S. player. However, he must be very careful not to suffer too many casualties, as this could cause his tribe to go on reservation or become extinct, which costs the player dearly in victory points.&#10;&#10;";1995;5.75161;3.1935;1;5;480;12;American Indian Wars, American West, Wargame
232;Serenissima;"The Theme&#10;&#10;In the fourteenth century, the Atlantic was an ocean without end and America was yet to be discovered. The Mediterranean was a sea of great prosperity - the only route between East and West. The greatest fleets of the age battled for the most lucrative trade routes.&#10;&#10;Trade cities like Venice, Genoa, Barcelona or Istanbul grew as powerful as whole nations, establishing trade routes as far as North Africa or Middle East, bringing back Spice, Gems or Gold to the western Mediterranean. SERENISSIMA recreates this era, when the Mediterranean was at the centre of world trade.&#10;&#10;The Game&#10;&#10;Each players assume the role of one of those four city-states. Their goal is to establish their sphere of influence in the Mediterranean, and share all sorts of commodities to make their trading empire the most prosperous. In the course of a game, players must build galleys, hire crew and buy/sell commodities. The value of goods can be influenced by players having monopolies in certain commodities. Players can also take control of ports, thereby earning extra income from players using the port, as well as being able to get this port's specific commodity.&#10;&#10;In the end, the scoring is based on the number of ports each player control, but also on the fact that those ports have commodities of different kind available. Ports come in three types : small, medium, and city-states. Whereas small ports are quite easy to satisfy (they need only two commodities to be considered &quot;full&quot;), the four starting city-states are far more difficult to please, as they will need all kind of commodities available (6 additional commodities, plus the one they produce).&#10;&#10;During the course of the game, the number and type of commodities available in ports also controls the number of crew members you can hire, if you can build galleys or forts, and the price of commodities when you sell them. For example, a player won't be able to build new galleys until they have wood and iron available in one of the ports they control. Once a galley has been built, it has 5 spaces available, that can be filled by the crew or the goods. Every crew member allows movement through one space, and makes the galley more powerful. But those spaces are also needed to carry the goods that are worth money. Money that can be used to hire new crews, build new galleys, or commodities. A balance thus needs to be struck between trading commodities and taking control of ports - between a fleet of merchant galleys and a fleet of warships.&#10;&#10;The game lasts between 5 to 8 turns depending on the number of active players. Turn order is defined by bidding. The winner of the bid choose whether he will play first, second, third or last. Depending on the situation and what the player wants to do, playing first or last might be equally interesting.

It presents a conflict between two super-powers of Antiquity from classical Clausewitzian perspective, according to which a power only reverts to military operations when there is no other way to achieve the goal: political dominance.&#10;&#10;Players use Strategy Cards for multiple purposes: moving generals, levying new troops, reinforcing existing armies, gaining political control of the provinces involved in the war, and introducing historical events. When two armies meet on the battlefield, a second set of cards, called Battle Cards, are used to determine the winner. Ultimately both players seek victory by dominating both fronts: military and political.&#10;&#10;";1996;7.77953;3.4549;2;2;200;12;Ancient, Political, Wargame
235;Blackbeard;"Introduction (from the rule book):&#10;&#10;BLACKBEARD recreates &quot;The Golden Age of Piracy&quot; at the turn of the 18th century. Each player becomes one or more pirates and attempts to amass a fortune and retire before a King's Commissioner tracks him down, a Warship stumbles across him, or his own crew cuts his throat! Merchant ships plying the trade routes are the targets. Prizes range from near-worthless supplies to the fabulous Spanish and Mogul treasure ships. Luck, skill and cunning all play a part as you comb the Seven Seas (well ... at least three of them) for fame and fortune. Players should be aware that the game simulates 18th century piracy and therefore features random happenstance. Little can be planned. Players who are ready to strike when opportunity presents itself and are wily and aggressive without being rash will fare best in the long run.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players take up the roles of famous pirates navigating the major sea lanes during the golden age of piracy.  Plunder and pirateering await as each player moves about on the map in a variable system through a deck of cards.  Rather than the normal turn order in games, players move when their designation is drawn in a deck.  When not in the role of their pirate they can take on the role of one of the English military ships hunting the sea for pirates.  By making shrewd choices and having some luck the player can end the game a wealthy and retired pirate with a large fleet of ships that have been accumulated over the years.&#10;&#10;";1991;6.39316;3.2209;1;4;240;12;Adventure, Age of Reason, Nautical, Pirates, Wargame

240;Britannia;"&quot;Britannia&quot; is a historical Strategic board-wargame that broadly depicts the millennia-long struggle for control of England, Scotland, and Wales. The game begins with the Roman invasion of 43 A.D., continues through the many struggles between Angles, Saxons, Picts, Norsemen, Scots, Irish, and other tribes, and ends with the Norman invasion of 1066.&#10;&#10;Britannia allows players to re-create this epic history, re-enacting important battles in some cases, altering the course of history in others. The game rules discourage players from making historically unrealistic moves, but also give players the freedom to alter Great Britain&rsquo;s history in important ways, creating countless interesting &ldquo;what if?&rdquo; scenarios. What if Boudicca&rsquo;s Revolt against the Romans had been more successful? What if the Romans and the Romano-British had repelled the Saxon invasions of the 5th and 6th centuries? What if William the Conqueror had died during the Norman invasion of 1066?&#10;&#10;In Britannia, the players will determine the destiny of a kingdom.&#10;&#10;";1986;7.1895;3.1596;3;5;300;12;Ancient, Civilization, Medieval, Wargame

242;Junta;"Players represent various families in Republica de los Bananas. Each game turn has between 7 and 9 rounds, drawing cards, President assigns roles, foreign aid money is drawn, the president proposes a budget which is voted on, locations are chosen, there are assassination attempts, then the bank may be open or not, there may be a coup and aftermath, then the next round starts. The game is won by whoever has the most pesos in their Swiss bank account when the money runs out.&#10;&#10;The game is for 4 to 7 players (although there are 2 and 3 player variants).  A president for life (El Presidente) is elected and then she or he allocates roles for all other players.  Depending upon his or her office and the various cards they hold, each player has a certain number of votes. These are important for the first vote to elect El Presidente and then there are votes each turn on the budget proposed by the President. The budget starts when the President draws 8 money cards face down from the money deck (which varies in denomination from $1 to $3) and proposes allocations. Not everyone will be included in the budget and the amounts are at the President's discretion. The President can keep undisclosed foreign aid money.&#10;&#10;Players may attempt to assassinate the other players including the President by guessing where they will be from among five locations. Players who successfully assassinate another player take that player's unbanked money, the only safe money is the money that has been deposited in a players' Swiss bank account, and the only way to get to the bank is to survive the assassination round. Players assassinated or killed simply become another member of their family and begin again with new cards, but keeping any of their family's funds deposited in their Swiss bank account.&#10;&#10;If players are unhappy, see an advantage, or just want to, and there is a 'coup excuse', they can start a coup. A coup sees players compete using armed forces to control a majority of the 5 power centers. Rebel players control the forces of the role which they were assigned prior to the coup  (e.g. army, navy, air force), and players loyal to the President do the same, seeking to control the strongholds until the coup is over. At the conclusion of each coup players who have control of the 5 power centres vote to be pro-President or pro-Junta determining if the President stays, or the Junta wins and elects a new President. And someone is sent to the firing squad.&#10;&#10;";1979;6.68805;2.858;2;7;240;16;Economic, Humor, Negotiation, Political

Thrill to the dust of chariot races, or the skillful bloodshed of gladiatorial combat. Circus Maximus is really TWO games in one. In the Chariot Race game you pick your team of horses, driver, and chariot car, each of which have special characteristics . . . In Gladiator, you pick up your weapons and step onto the bloodstained sands, simultaneously maneuvering, striking, and waiting for that fatal step that puts you inside your opponent's guard.&quot;&#10;&#10;Battleline&#039;s Circus Maximus would later be developed by Don Greenwood and published in 1980 by The Avalon Hill Game Co as separate titles: Circus Maximus and Gladiator.&#10;&#10;Violent and bloody, Circus Maximus details the chariot races that occurred in ancient Rome.  Eight teams race around the track three times to determine victory.  Players prepare for the race by selecting the composition of their team of horses, their rider's skills, and the type of chariot that will be driven.  Once the race begins the players are free to do as they wish to hamper the other racers including whipping the rider, ramming chariots with scythed wheels, smashing into horses, and running over crashed opponents.  A campaign game of multiple races, in which players have to manage their teams and can increase their income by betting on races, is also possible.&#10;&#10;";1979;6.77623;2.6205;2;10;120;12;Ancient, Fighting, Racing

However only one boat will make any forward progress in a given turn, so players try to convince everyone to vote for his particular favorite.  To further complicate matters, the sailors can't seem to decide which boat they want to be in, so they're constantly jumping out of boats to swim to another one.  As if all that wasn't enough, one of the boats springs a leak each turn.  If the boat is at maximum occupancy when the leak occurs, then players vote to decide who to toss to the sharks!&#10;&#10;";1993;6.58034;1.7821;3;6;90;12;Nautical, Negotiation, Party Game

Game takes about 10 minutes to learn and 1-2 hours to play, high solitaire playability.  The rules are as simple as possible. Units have Zones of control, which cannot be exited. When in enemy ZOC, combat is mandatory. Units may advance after combat. Retreats through ZOCs are forbidden, so you need to surround the enemy to eliminate him. Artillery may fire two hexes away (and not suffer from adverse results). Cavalry units are just faster and weaker infantry units .  There are two scenarios.  The historical one pictures Napoleon in Jena, outnumbering the Prussians, and Davout in Auerstadt, outnumbered by other Prussians. ). To win, you have to eliminate as many enemy units as possible at the end of the game (thus demoralizing the enemy).  The second &quot;what-if&quot; scenario assumes that all the Prussians have been sent to Jena, for the decisive battle. Davout will enter as reinforcement, on the flank/back of the Prussians, but in the end of the game.

He follows that up by playing a unit, either German or Allied, that was available in the chosen year and could fight in the chosen environment, and the other players subsequently either pass or play a unit (of either nationality) that meets the same conditions.  When all players have made their selections, dice (sometimes) are rolled and totals are compared to determine whether the Germans or the Allies won.  The player who contributed the most to the winning team gets to decide how the convoy and the opposing enemy ships, which are all worth victory points and possibly an increased hand size, are to be distributed amongst the players who were on the winning side.

A number of tickets are displayed in rows, divided into two types: The more expensive scheduled flights which allow you to move directly to the printed city, or move your token a number of city spaces orthogonally on the board. Cheaper charter flights allow movement directly between the two city spaces printed on the ticket. You may buy tickets at any time during your turn, and you are not required to move but must do so before taking any regular actions; you may also use any many tickets in a turn as you wish.&#10;&#10;The regular actions include building hotels and factories. Hotels are built on a u-shaped track. When a hotel is built on a red space the building that is oldest/furthest back on the track is removed. Players with the first and second most hotels on the track will be the only ones to score, with ties broken by the player with the earliest bulding on the track. There are only two factory spaces per city, and they will score points equal to the second place of the hotel scoring. In lieu of any actions or flying, or if you simply have no money, you may also take out loans; this removes your token from the board and forces you to use the more costly scheduled flights to return to the board.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game players are given all of their factories. Each round players are given a set number of hotels in addition to any they have left over from the previous round. When any player has built all of the hotels in front of them a scoring occurs. After three scorings the game ends and the player with the most money is the winner.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.75611;2.6375;2;4;90;10;Economic

270;Svea Rike;"From user review:&#10;&#10;The game is designed to re-create the history of Sweden from 1523 (the reign of Gustav Vasa) to 1818 (Karl XIII). Each player represent one of five noble families attempting to build status for their family. Status is achieved by accumulating fiefs, money, history cards in sets (which include such things as Queens, scientists, cultural personalities, palaces, commanders, etc.), troops and merchants.&#10;&#10;The game is driven by event cards ... and there are a ton of 'em. On a turn, a player draws an event card and can play as many of them as he sees fit (whether during his turn or not). Thus, the game becomes a series of various events, usually aiding the player and/or hurting his opponents in some fashion.&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Svea Rike: Batalj&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Note:&#10;The game was first published by Casper in 1996, and after their demise by Anv&#195;&#164;ndbart Litet F&#195;&#182;retag (ALF) in the early 2000s.&#10;&#10;";1996;6.39677;2.4419;2;5;120;12;Civilization, Economic

272;Downtown;"Taking a fairly common theme, this game is about building three types of neighborhoods in a developing city.  Each turn one or two blocks will get zoned, based on the players' votes.  Once all four properties in a block have been bought and the block has been zoned, its base score is the number of completed blocks adjoining it.  However, there are serious multipliers (positive and negative) for locating certain types of developments next to each other.&#10;&#10;1st Place 1996 Hippodice Spieleautorenwettbewerb (as Boomtown).&#10;&#10;";1996;6.33014;2.2353;3;6;60;12;City Building, Negotiation

274;Guerilla;"Guerilla is a multi-player simulation card-wargame. Three to six players vie for control of the government as rebels wage a civil war against those in power. As in real guerrilla warfare, the government forces are handicapped by their inability to separate friend from foe. This &quot;fog of war&quot; is accomplished by a clever dichotomy of goals wherein each player simultaneously commands both government and rebel forces. However, each player is secretly backing either the government of rebel cause and is severely penalized if his &quot;side&quot; doesn't win the hand.&#10;&#10;Consequently, players are always torn between scoring for their &quot;side&quot;, or for themselves, or even sacrificing their own resources for the sake of an opponent who appears to be on their side. But is he? Even when you think you've figured out who is who, the Revolution card can appear to change loyalties and totally cloud the issue again.&#10;&#10;Players score by eliminating opposing forces, manipulating the media and world opinion, or controlling various installations such as the Port or Airfield which grant special abilities to those who hold them. Government air power and armor columns struggle against ambushing guerrilla bands which fade back into the jungle without a trace. If atrocities are committed, the U.N. may intervene and attempt to stop the open warfare. Then the battle is fought by secret police who ferret out traitors while propaganda battles are waged for the hearts and minds of the populace. Assassins abound as influential leaders are targeted in an attempt to paralyze opposing troops in preparation for the day when the U.N. withdraws.&#10;&#10;Game length is variable and selected at outset.

The object of the game is to create large herds of dinosaurs while making your opponent's dino herds extinct.&#10;&#10;The game is played over 3 rounds, representing the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods. During each round, players can meld herds of herbivorous dinos to earn points at the end of the round, play egg cards in hopes of adding to an established herd later in the game. There are several calamity cards that can be drawn, or played by another player, to throw a wrench into a player's plans. Some of these include meat-eating dinosaurs, egg-eating cards and gene pool disasters.&#10;&#10;The larger your herds, and the more herds featuring different types of dinos, the more points you can earn at the end of each period.

276;La Guerre de l'Empereur: The Emperor's War, 1805-1815;"La Guerre de l'Empereur: The Emperor's War, 1805-1815 is a game of maneuver and battle between the forces under Napoleon Bonaparte and six other nations that both opposed and supported him at various times in the years between 1805 and 1815. Players vie for dominance of early 19th Century Europe. As the French player, you'll set Napoleon and his armies upon a continent whose differing political statures plays right into your hands. The greatest army in Europe is at your hands...&#10;&#10;Divide and conquer! As the British player, you'll utilize diplomacy, clever event play, a powerhouse economy and the greatest navy in the world to become the dominant nation. As Russia, Austria, Prussia, Spain or the Ottoman Empire, you must strike a balance between expansionist aggression and diplomatic harmony among your neighbors. Indeed, a nation must expand to triumph. However the means chosen to that end will largely decide the level of success. Play  the part of being everyone's friend and your nation will likely live in relative safety...and lose the game miserably. Play the part of the blind aggressor and you'll likely go down faster than the peace broker. Striking a balance is critical.&#10;&#10;The game map covers the territories from Scandinavia in the north to the Mediterranean and North Africa in the south, and from deep Russia in the east to Portugal and the Atlantic in the west. Movement is by areas (provinces) on land, and sea zones at sea. On land, the units of maneuver are (roughly) corps, while at sea each unit represents a naval squadron. When opposing land armies meet for battle, corps are broken down into divisions (loosely) and deployed on a eight zone battle map for combat resolution. The dice-less combat engine uses a system of battle options which are played and cross-referenced for resolution of actual casualties and morale loss. The number of battle options distributed, along with the initial army morale of the opposing sides, is determined by army size, nationality and leaders present. The battle options are of offensive and defensive nature. The offensive options cover standard maneuvers such as &quot;Flank Attack&quot;, &quot;Cavalry Charge&quot; and &quot;Assault&quot;, while the defensive options are things such as &quot;Refuse Flanks&quot;, &quot;Squares Formed&quot; and &quot;Reverse Slopes&quot;.&#10;&#10;The rules are relatively simple and fast moving, even though a host of subtleties and complexities of the Napoleonic period are represented within the game system. The means by which this relative simplicity was achieved was (largely) through the use of self-explanatory strategic event charts. Be warned: This game is easy to understand and play, but very difficult to master.&#10;&#10;The game system works the same whether you're playing with two players or seven. With multiple players, you'll need all of your diplomacy skills to enlist aid in achieving your goals. With fewer players, the event charts will handle the bulk of the diplomatic duties. Regardless of how many players you have, all seven major powers will actively participate to a greater or lesser degree.&#10;&#10;";1997;6.4589;3.3846;2;7;240;12;Economic, Napoleonic, Negotiation, Wargame

278;Catan Card Game;"Catan Card Game bears only a slight resemblance to The Settlers of Catan, the original game in the Catan series.  There are six resources: wool, wood, bricks, grain, ore, and gold. Before beginning the game, the players receive six square cards showing the resources, with a different die number on each card. In addition, the players start the game with two village cards and a road card connecting them. There are card stacks of more roads and villages, as well as cities, to be purchased during the game. With each new village or city comes two new resource cards. Villages and cities give victory points.&#10;&#10;When the number die is rolled, instead of collecting more cards, the players rotate the corresponding card 90 degrees to indicate a gain of one more of that resource; i.e., the brick card shows a picture of one brick on one edge of the card, two bricks on the next clockwise edge, three bricks along the third edge, and zero bricks on the fourth edge. There is also an event die, with five possible outcomes:&#10;&#10;&#10;     a reward for the player with more knight points or more 'windmill' points (a picture of a windmill on some cards),&#10;     a bonus resource,&#10;     an attack if a player has too many resources, and&#10;     one of six special events - civil war, conflict, master builder, plague, productive year, or progress.     &#10;&#10;&#10;There are 62 expansion cards in six stacks in the center of the table. Before beginning the game, players choose one stack, go through it, and choose three cards to hold in their hands. Forty-two of the expansion cards require spending resources to be put into play, gaining civic improvements or knights. Every civic improvement serves some useful function or adds victory points or both. Twenty of the cards are actions benefiting one of the players or harming the other. After a player pays to put a card down or uses an action card, he blindly draws a replacement. Unwanted or unusable cards can be traded in future turns. Some of the cards have flags on them, indicating victory points.&#10;&#10;Whoever first has twelve victory points wins the game!&#10;&#10;The Anniversary edition of this game (Jubil&auml;umsausgabe, tin box edition) can be found under a separate game entry due to some differences in content: Die Siedler von Catan: Das Kartenspiel &#226;&#128;&#147; 10th Anniversary Special Edition Tin Box.&#10;&#10;Belongs to the Catan Series.&#10;&#10;";1996;6.70132;2.4386;2;2;120;10;Card Game, City Building, Territory Building
279;The Very Clever Pipe Game;"The game consists of a set of cards. The cards have white and black pipes in various six-outlet configurations, and players take turns placing them onto the table.  When a player constructs a completely closed-off section of pipe in their color, he takes all the cards from that section.  After all cards have been played, the player with the most scored cards wins.  Additionally, the cards also have two different floors (which appear underneath the pipes) that can be used to expand the game to a four-player affair.&#10;&#10;The game was re-released in 2002 with a reduced deck (48 cards instead of 120) as part of the Hip Pocket Games series.&#10;&#10;";1996;6.21525;1.5926;2;4;20;10;Abstract Strategy, Card Game
280;Neue Spiele im alten Rom;"Neue Spiele im Alten Rom (or New Games in Old Rome (NGIOR)) is a compendium of games from Reiner Knizia. In the box are fourteen games themed on ancient Rome. The games are themed to cover, albeit in a highly abstract fashion, the rise of Rome, the Roman Republic and finally, the Empire.&#10;&#10;(7 of the games are described below)&#10;&#10;The Wheel of History : 2-5 players&#10;&#10;This is an early version of what was to become Bunte Runde. 25 cards are laid out in a large circle, representing the tribes to be united under early Rome. Players may advance a pawn one, two or three spaces forwards and collect a card. Cards are scored on face value, but there are some quirks that vary this.&#10;&#10;The Seven Hills of Rome : 2 players&#10;&#10;This is one of the easier games in the compendium. The theme here is you are battling your opponent for control of the seven hills of Rome. The hills are represented by seven cards, numbered 1 to 7, laid out between the players. Cards are played from a hand against the 'hills' in an attempt to influence them to your side. You sum the hills you control at the end of the game, and the highest total wins.&#10;&#10;Mercator : 3-7 players&#10;&#10;This game is Medici&#039;s ancestor. It is a simplified version of Medici, with the chief differences being you can hold six cards on your ship, and you are competing for highest value totals only. The number of each suit taken is meaningless, except in a variant where you get paid a bonus if you get one of each. The game lasts only one round. Medici is worth purchasing on its own, but this is still worth a look.&#10;&#10;Imperium : 3-5 players&#10;&#10;The aim is to earn points for control of each of the 9 areas on the board. The game lasts 9 turns, and at the end of each turn, the area matching the turn number is evaluated for control and points are awarded. On your turn, 3 cards are revealed simultaneously. These cards are numbered 1 to 9, with 2 additional banner cards. The numbers correspond to the areas you want to place control markers into. The banner cards indicate you want one or two extra chips placed in the indicated area. After control markers are placed, the current turn's area is evaluated - points being awarded to the winner and perhaps the second and third places as well. After 9 turns, the player with the most points wins. As you progress, the points awarded for each area increases, giving a nice feeling of acceleration.&#10;&#10;Senator : 2-3 players&#10;&#10;You play a Roman faction trying to position your people (a hand of cards) into the senate. They can only get their via the senate steps. The board is a grid of 5x5 spaces, The 9 spaces in the center are the senate, while 12 of the remaining 16 are the steps spaces that run around the perimeter of the senate. Cards are placed initially on the steps, and then pushed into the senate by placing more cards on the steps.&#10;&#10;Circus Maximus : 3-5 players&#10;&#10;A simple chariot racing game where players are competing to be the first to get their team of three chariots around the hex map circuit and onto the podium. Each player has a set of cards face up in front of them, numbered 1 to 5. To move a chariot they select up to three cards per chariot which that is the movement allowance for that piece. The movement off each card must be in a straight line, so some rather clumsy cornering ability is built into the game. Cards used by a chariot are turned face down, becoming unavailable for the other chariots still to move. Each chariot must be moved at least once per turn, if possible. Therefore, the trick is to maximize your movement with your 15 points each turn.&#10;&#10;Consul : 2-4 players&#10;&#10;This is an intriguing memory game, that, like most of the games in this compendium, have a hard time being fitted into a theme! Twenty-five cards are turned face down in a grid. Players start the game each holding three cards in their hand. On their turn, players make a bid to take a turn. The highest bid gets to turn up cards until they choose to finish, or make a mistake. Cards in a set can be of the same value, or same color, or both. The value of the set must equal of exceed the bid made, simply by summing the face values of the cards. If a mistake is made, the cards are turned face down, and the player must discard a card from their hand into the grid. If the bid is made, the cards are taken into the players hand. At the end of the game, the highest total held wins.&#10;&#10;--&#10;&#10;Translated rulebook to the contrary, this game has never been published by an English publisher.&#10;&#10;Note: 3 of these have been printed/repackaged in English by GMT in Rome: Imperium, Circus Maximus, Hannibal vs Rome.&#10;&#10;";1994;6.83873;2.3333;2;7;60;10;Abstract Strategy, Game System

292;Attacke;"Themed as a joust of knights, Attacke is a simple card laying contest. The cards are in 5 colors and are numbered 2,3,4,5, &amp; 7. From a hand of five, a player lays one or more cards of one color, declares the total value, and draws one card. Following players must lay cards to beat that total in that color to stay in the round. If you can't or choose not to play, you're out and draw a final card. The round continues with players adding more cards to their total or dropping out until one player remains and that player takes a token in that color. There are joker cards (shields) of 7 or 10.

Players take turns choosing any tile from the trail, but can never turn back to choose a tile they have already passed. There are 15 different sets of tiles (three sets each of 8, 6, 4, 2, and 1), and when the last tile of any set has been claimed, the player holding the most in that set scores that number of points, while the player holding second most scores half that number. Complicating matters, there are also three tie-breaker tiles and three tiles that let you &quot;buy&quot; a tile from another player. It's an exercise in numbers that plays quickly, probably 30 minutes tops, and is suitable for youngsters yet susceptible to analysis.

Actually very simple, players take turns to put their colored pieces in different rooms. Whenever a row, column, diagonal or room is full, it is scored, with the majority holder getting the value of the length, and any minority holders losing points.

304;Evergreen;"Combination of card play and timing from Wolfgang Kramer &amp; Michael Kiesling. There are some recording artists who are famous for singing certain standards. Players are putting on concerts and use numbered cards for each performer to take control of that singer. The singers are represented by old fashioned 45s, with a disc in the center showing values from 5 to 12. Each time a singer is transferred from control of one player to another, the disc is rotated, so the value can rise to 12, but next move, it drops to 5 again. You try to gain control of an artist at high value, or pass artists from one player to another to make them devalue. Scoring occurs when players choose to put on concerts at the end of their turn, including a gala show which doubles the value. The game rules state that the designers produced this game by phone and fax, without ever meeting. Perhaps that shows, as it has interest, but the game uses a sand-timer to apply pressure to your decisions.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.54669;1.8571;2;6;30;12;Card Game, Music

308;Santa Fe;"Each game is made up of rounds. A round begins with all players playing one card from their hands and placing it face down on the table. Then, all cards are exposed simultaneously.&#10;&#10;There are 66 City Cards and each carry a name of a city along with a number value (ranging from 2 to 7). Since the trains begin their expansion from the easternmost part of the board, the farther west the city, the higher its number value. Players score points only for City Cards that are played and placed face up. Cards that remain unplayed in hands have no value. The numerical value of a City Card is multiplied by the number of railroads connected to it.&#10;&#10;Players may also play a Double turn Card, a combination of a City Card with a Branch Line card or a combination of a Double Turn Card and a Branch Line Card.&#10;&#10;A Double Turn Card allows a player to place two pieces of track in both track phases of a turn (although only one piece of track may be placed if desired). Furthermore, all bonuses are doubled during the round that card is played.&#10;&#10;Each Railroad has two Branch Line Cards and a player may pay $1 and draw one of them. (Players may only hold one Branch Line Card in their hands at any one time.) If held, the Branch Line Card must be played immediately on the next round in conjunction with either a City or Double Turn Card.&#10;&#10;Play of a Branch Line Card allows a player to start a new route of track for the named railroad from any city that railroad connects, thereby extending the railroad.&#10;&#10;After exposing a card, the round continues with two turns of laying track. Players do not control any specific rail line. Each player can place track on any color provided that the played track connects to an existing corresponding rail network on the board. Once all track is placed, all players replenish their hands (up to five cards). The First Player passes the First Player Train to the player on the left (who becomes the First Player for the subsequent round) and the next round begins.&#10;&#10;The first player to connect the first railroad to any city earns $2. Certain cities are marked with colored squares (matching the colors of certain railroads). Should a corresponding color railroad enter that city, the player making that connection gets a bonus of $4. Double Turn Cards double all bonuses in a round.&#10;&#10;When all track pieces of all the railroads have been played or if a player is unable to play any piece of track because all playable railroads are &quot;dead-ended&quot;, the game ends and points are tallied.&#10;&#10;Points are received in two ways. First, players receive 1 point for each $1 they have. Second, each City Card is worth its value times the number of different rail lines connected to it. The player with the highest total wins! (In case of a tie, the player with the most City Cards valued at &quot;7&quot; is declared the victor.)&#10;&#10;";1992;6.94839;2.2;2;5;70;10;Trains
310;Wizard's Quest;"A Heroic Fantasy Wargame wherein Peacemaker the Wizard, tired of eons of conflict over rulership of the island kingdom of Marnon, sets up a quest competition to choose the rightful ruler and end all bloodshed forever.&#10;&#10;The map portrays the island of Marnon divided into 36 numbered territories and 8 bordering castle spaces. Orcs are placed in approximately 1/3rd of these spaces, then players place their Men in the remaining spaces. An opposing player places your 3 Magic Items around the map for you to find later. The first player to collect all three of their own treasures is the winner.&#10;&#10;Each turn, Orcs around the board repopulate and then frenzy, indiscriminately attacking nearby Men. The Dragon flies around and eats Orcs and Men. Peacemaker the Wizard visits a region and bestows prosperity, and also enforces peace there that turn. After all this, each player may petition the Wizard for a card, receive reinforcements, and then carry out an attack campaign. Players forces include Men and two 'superpower' counters: Hero and Sorcerer.&#10;&#10;Garret J. Donner later took his concept of objects moving semi-randomly and sometimes under partial control of the players (The Wizard and The Dragon) and designed the game Dragonhunt around it.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 2&#10;&#10;";1979;6.21633;2.2485;2;6;180;12;Adventure, Fantasy, Wargame

314;Highlanders;"Rheingold is basically a Castle Risk-style game without the dice combat. The board depicts, rather fetchingly, eighteen castles on or near the Rhine. These are given point values depending on their size or importance, ranging between 1 and 3. The castles are linked to numerous movement areas by tracks meaning that some of the castles are in powerful positions (especially those providing or guarding a river bridge) and others are stuck out on a limb. At the start of the game, the castles aren't owned by anyone and the winner of the game is the one with the most points of captured castles at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;";1993;6.17996;2.0;3;5;90;12;Medieval, Wargame
316;Chase;"Each player starts Chase with a row of nine dice on their side of the hexagonal game board, with the faces of those d6s adding up to 25. On a turn, a player moves a die as many spaces in a straight line as the value showing on the die's face. A die can't move through another piece, but it can wrap around the side of the board and it can bounce off the front or back wall at an angle to move its full distance.&#10;&#10;If you land a die on an opponent's die, that second die is removed and the value of that die added to the lowest die on the opponent's team, keeping their pip count at 25. (If a die reaches 6, you add any remaining speed to what is now the lowest die.) If you land on one of your own dice, you bump that die one space in the same direction, possibly leading to another bump or a capture.&#10;&#10;Instead of moving, if you have two dice next to one another, you can spend the turn adjusting their values while keeping their sum the same. If, for example, you have a 2 and 5 adjacent to one another, you can change them to 1 &amp; 6, 3 &amp; 4, 4 &amp; 3, 5 &amp; 2, or 6 &amp; 1.&#10;&#10;The center of the board has a chamber on it. You cannot move a die through the chamber. If you land a die on the chamber, you split the value of that die on two dice as evenly as possible. (You start the game with one spare.) Those dice emerge from the chamber on spaces adjacent to it, possibly resulting in bumps or captures.&#10;&#10;If you knock an opponent down to only four dice, then they have a pip count below 25 and they lose the game.&#10;&#10;";1985;6.82064;2.6579;2;2;45;10;Abstract Strategy, Dice

320;Scrabble;"In this classic word game, players use their seven drawn letter-tiles to form words on the gameboard. Each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses.  But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word.  This leads to slightly tactical play, as potential words are rejected because they would give an opponent too much access to the better bonus spaces.&#10;&#10;Skip-a-cross was licensed by Selchow &amp; Righter and manufactured by Cadaco. Both games have identical rules but Skip-a-cross has tiles and racks made of cardboard instead of wood.

322;Tonga Bonga;"In Tonga Bonga, each player pilots a ship around a little group of islands with the goal of visiting four of the five remote islands and returning to Tonga Bonga Bay.&#10;&#10;Winning the race does not win the game, however; what matters is having the most money. Each player has room for three sailors (represented by dice) on their ship, and at the start of a round, in order players decide how much money to offer the sailors who will serve as their captain and first mate that round. (The cabin boy always works for free.) Next, in order players roll their dice, then assign one die to each other ship &mdash; never their own! If you place a die with an equal or higher pip value on a ship where a die already present, you bump that earlier die to a lesser role. (In short, the ships always end up with the highest die in the captain position.) One side of each die has a seasick sailor, who doesn't go to sea that round, so not all ships will necessarily be full.&#10;&#10;Once all the dice have been placed, in order players move their ship, ideally reaching islands before others and leaving one of your tokens there. Whenever you land on an island, you reach $25 from the bank, but you must then pay $5 to each player who landed there ahead of you. At the end of a round, players collect the wages next to the captain and first mate spots holding their dice.&#10;&#10;A player who has visited four islands can return to Tonga Bonga Bay, collecting $10 when they dock there. At the end of that round, the game ends, and whoever has the most money wins.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.48815;1.6818;3;4;45;10;Economic, Nautical, Racing

334;Advance to Boardwalk;"Don't let the name fool you. The game has nothing to do with Monopoly. The name was obviously chosen in an attempt to capitalize on that mega-selling monster.&#10;&#10;There are four tracts of land illustrated on the board, which depicts an ocean-front boardwalk. Each tract of land contains five properties valued from $1 million to $8 million. Each turn, a player rolls two regular dice and one special die. The special die has four sides depicting a color matching one of the land tracts, with the other two sides depicting a 'W' and 'F' respectively. The number rolled on the regular two dice is the amount of money the player can spend on development, while the color depicted on the special die is the tract of land he may build on. Thus, if a player rolled an 8 and a red, he has $8 million to spend on developing buildings in the red tract. He can split this $8 million as he sees fit. For example, he may build a building on the $5 million plot and one on the $3 million plot; or he may opt to build one building on the $8 million plot. Quite a few building options here.&#10;&#10;The 'W' on the special die is a 'wild' color. If it was rolled instead of a color, the player may select which tract he wishes to build on. The 'F' means that a player draws a Fortune card and does not build that turn. Fortune cards allow a player to perform a variety of actions, including constructing extra buildings, moving one of his already placed buildings, removing an opponent's building, etc. A player may play one of these Fortune cards per turn.&#10;&#10;When a player constructs a building and obtains the most buildings on a particular plot, he takes the deed to that property and moves his token along the boardwalk an amount equal to the value of the deed. If a player wrested control of the deed from an opponent, the opponent is then moved back that number of spaces. Buildings are placed on the board in a fashion identical to that used in Manhattan...they are stacked on top of existing buildings. If there is a tie for the most buildings, the player who built first on that plot possesses the deed.&#10;&#10;Some have described this game as 'Manhattan lite', and they're not far off. One certainly has similar thought processes and must constantly keep an eye out for optimum plays which will wrest control of deeds (control of buildings in Manhattan) from opponents. There's another planning element thrown in, too. Certain spaces along the boardwalk are marked with an 'F'. If a player advances his token to one of these locations, he draws a Fortune card. These cards can be extremely powerful and cause a severe swing in deed controls. Thus, it is not always wise to go for the largest deed acquisition if a lesser gain would allow you to move your token onto an 'F' location. Clever.&#10;&#10;The game continues until one player has placed all of his buildings (sounds a bit like Rheinl&#195;&#164;nder, doesn't it?) or until one player has reached the end of the boardwalk. The player with the highest total value of deeds is the victor.&#10;&#10;";1985;5.42863;1.5278;2;4;60;8;Economic

338;Bargain Hunter;"This game illustrates Herr Rosenberg&#039;s talent for unique card games.  The deck is one through nine in six suits, with two of each card (two 1s, two 2s, etc.).  After the initial hand of eight is dealt, players select one card value to collect, which is placed face-up in front of each player.  A fairly standard trick-taking game takes place with the remaining cards, with players following suit if they can.  If you cannot, the card you play can be trump, if you desire.  If two cards of the same suit/value appear, the second can be declared as either high or low.  When a player wins a trick, the cards of the same value they are collecting are placed in his 'good' pile, with each worth one point.  All the rest are put in the 'bad' pile, with each worth minus one point.  However at the end of each hand, you can convert one value of cards from your 'bad' pile onto the 'good' pile.  Of course, if you had enough of them, you'll be collecting that value for the next hand...&#10;&#10;";1998;6.69097;1.8657;3;4;45;10;Card Game

344;Classic Art;"In Classic Art, first released as Members Only, players attempt to predict how many works of art will be present in five exhibitions. The riskier your predictions in a season, the more you score &mdash; but only if you're correct, of course!&#10;&#10;The game consists of 65 cards, with 13 cards in each of five categories; eleven of the cards are &quot;positive&quot; and two are &quot;negative&quot;. At the start of each season, players get a hand of cards (7-11 depending on the player count) and two cards are placed face up from the deck in their respective exhibitions.&#10;&#10;In the first round of the season, players may predict how many works of art will be in an exhibition at the end of the current season by placing 1-2 tokens (along with their high risk token) on a prediction space. Each exhibition allows you to bet on whether the art will be rare (bet spaces 1-4) or plentiful (bet spaces 5-8). In each subsequent round, a player must place two cards from their hand in the appropriate exhibitions, then they may place a prediction. They may place only one &quot;double token&quot; prediction in a season, and predicting is optional. When all players have only three cards in hand, they each discard one face down, then place the other two cards in exhibitions. Whenever a negative card and positive card appear in an exhibition, remove them.&#10;&#10;At the end of a season, players score for correct predictions. If art in an exhibition is &quot;rare&quot;, i.e., four or fewer works, then all plentiful bets fail, and vice versa. What's more, a rare bet succeeds only if the number of works is equal to or fewer than the bet, e.g., if you bet 3, then you succeed only if three or fewer works of art are present. A plentiful bid succeeds only if the number of works is equal to or more than the bet. The riskier the bet, the higher the payout per token in that successful bet, with players recording points separately for each exhibition.&#10;&#10;At the end of a season, tokens on failed bets (other than the high risk ones) are removed from play, while tokens on successful bids are returned to players. If a player has zero or one tokens at the end of a season, all of their tokens are returned to them.&#10;&#10;A player can score at most 10 points in an exhibition. Continue playing seasons until at the end of a season, each exhibition has at least one player who has scored 5 points in it. The game ends at the point, and players tally their scores &mdash; but tokens in the 0-4 range in an exhibition are worthless. Whoever scores the most points wins!&#10;&#10;In Members Only players bet on odd things like how many royal scandals will happen in a month, and in Glenn's Gallery, another version of this design, players bet on the number of customers who will show up to look at types of art, but otherwise gameplay is nearly identical to Classic Art. The only difference is that each player has a dedicated &quot;double bid&quot; token instead of being allowed to bid two tokens once per season.&#10;&#10;Classic Art includes a two-player variant that can be used in prior releases. After dealing eleven cards to each player, set up a ten-card &quot;house&quot; deck. On each player's turn, they play the top card of the house in addition to two cards from their hand. In the last round, play the final two cards from the house along with the chosen two cards from both players.&#10;&#10;";1996;6.59574;2.087;2;5;60;10;Card Game

Now each player follows in clockwise order playing a card, until everybody played one. The second player has the option to play either a card with the same color, or to open a second trick by playing a card of an different color next to the already played card. When someone plays a second color, he starts a second trick on the table. If the second player started a second trick, the third player just has the options to follow either one of the colors or discard a card of the third color (pass). He may not place a card of the third color on one of the existing tricks or start a third trick. If the second player followed the color of the first card, the third one has the option to start a 2nd trick (and so on).&#10;&#10;The players who played the card with the highest number in the respective trick win the respective cards.

354;Stick 'Em;"In the trick-taking card game Stick 'Em, first released as Sticheln, players seek to gather points each hand by taking as many cards as possible of all but one color, while trying to avoid cards of one color of their choosing.&#10;&#10;In more detail, at the beginning of each hand, each player simultaneously selects and reveals one card from their hand, with the color of this card representing their &quot;pain&quot; color. At the end of the hand, each card of this color that they've collected (including their initial choice from their hand) is worth negative points equal to the card's face value. Each card of another color that this player has collected is worth 1 point.&#10;&#10;To play out the hand, the active player leads a card, then each other player in clockwise order plays one card. If all cards are of the same color, then whoever played the highest card collects these cards, then leads the next trick; if all cards are not of the same color, then whoever played the highest card of a color not initially led collects these cards, then leads the next trick. (One exception: A zero card can never win a trick.) In effect, each color played in a particular trick that doesn't match the color of the card led is considered a trump card, and the highest trump wins. In the event of a tie, the earlier played card breaks the tie.&#10;&#10;Play as many hands as the number of players in the game, summing each player's points over those hands to determine a winner.&#10;&#10;Some versions of Sticheln allow for play with up to six players, while the third and fourth German editions of the game include enough cards to allow for play with up to eight players. (These versions also allow players to play the game Hattrick by the same designer, with rules for this game included as a variant.)&#10;&#10;";1993;7.04618;1.9038;3;8;60;10;Card Game

There are a few other details to complicate matters, but basically everyone repeats this process until someone has the 500 cash in hand to win the game.  Samarkand is an entertaining exercise with no especially brain-taxing strategies to figure out and makes a good family game.&#10;&#10;This game is sometimes called Bazaar II, because Schmidt Spiele originally published this game under the name Bazaar, even though Bazaar is a completely different game.

366;Viva Pamplona!;"In this fluffy, dice-intensive game set in Pamplona, Spain, players control 3-runner teams competing in the running of the bulls.  By rolling the dice and moving their runners (the most significant decisions are which runners to move, and how far to move them when a choice is available), the players try to keep their teams in front of and as close to the bull as possible, while pushing other runners into more cowardly locations.  The reason for all this is that after all players have had their turns, there's a chance that Toro will attack, and the players whose runners are in the most dangerous positions will score the most points.&#10;&#10;";1992;6.36903;1.3725;2;6;45;8;Racing
368;Relationship Tightrope;"This game is a relative of the Raj/Hols der Geier family of games, the german title means Tightrope.  Each turn, a number of red and blue sticks are up for grabs.  The highest card played will take the blue sticks and the lowest card will take the red sticks.  The trick is that a red stick cancels a blue stick (that is, a well balanced tightrope walker), and the goal is to score as few points as possible.  However, there are two different ways of playing the game, depending on how players wish to play: strategic or otherwise.  The basic game has players simultaneously playing cards (ala Raj), whereas the strategic version plays like a trick-taking game with players selecting a card sequentially.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Yin Yang/Fifty-Fifty&#10;&#10;&#10;";1999;6.184;1.3333;3;5;30;8;Card Game
370;El Grande: König & Intrigant;"This expansion for El Grande replaces two different elements from the original game, the action cards and the turn-order cards, with a single set of cards.  Prior to the start of the game, players cull their personal play decks to thirteen. Then each turn, they each select one of their cards, which will dictate their turn order priority, the number of caballeros to add to their court, the number of caballeros eligible to add to the board, and their action.&#10;&#10;This expansion is included in both the 10th Anniversary Edition (Decennial) of El Grande, as well as The El Grande Expansions, and El Grande Big Box&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    El Grande: K&#195;&#182;nig & Intrigant &#226;&#128;&#147; Player's Edition&#10;    El Grande: K&#195;&#182;nig & Intrigant &#226;&#128;&#147; Unverk&#195;&#164;ufliche Sonderkarten&#10;&#10;&#10;";1997;7.44539;3.0704;2;5;90;12;Expansion for Base-game, Political, Renaissance
372;Schotten Totten;"In Schotten Totten, nine boundary stones lie between you and your opponent.  In front of each, you build poker-like formations of three cards on a side.  Whoever plays the higher-ranking formation wins the stone.  And in a unique twist, you may use your powers of logic to claim a stone even before your opponent has played all three of his cards, by demonstrating that the stone is impossible for him to win.  Successfully claim five stones, or any three adjacent stones, and you win the game.&#10;&#10;In 2000 GMT published a rethemed version as Battle Line which includes an extra 10 &quot;tactics&quot; cards that modify the standard game play, and with cards that run from 1 to 10 (instead of 1 to 9).&#10;&#10;The 2004 Edition of Schottentotten has these &quot;tactics&quot; cards too.&#10;Schotten-Totten FAQ.&#10;&#10;";1999;7.3626;1.6847;2;2;20;8;Card Game
374;Colorado County;"In this unique game, players buy plots of land on a large, grass-covered board. After a random-like placement of twelve placement markers, the players simultaneously bid for cards which will allow the players to put control markers on the board in the positions indicated on the cards. However, only three cards are available, so only the top three bidders will receive a prize. As if the pressure wasn't enough, players receive a supply of bidding chips (called cowboy tiles) at the beginning of the game, which are only replenished by bidding lowest or zero (missing out on a card/placement) or by selling an owned plot (only 4 or 5 sales per game).&#10;&#10;Some of the plots that the players own will score differently, depending on the timing. At the beginning of the game, border plots are the key; later in the game, control of lakes and large masses of tokens are at a premium. The scoring values vary over the 4 rounds considerably.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.16557;2.4706;2;4;60;10;American West
376;DruidenWalzer;"In this brain-burner from the Kosmos two-player series, players try to protect their own trees and steal their opponents'. Each player has four trees, all of which are inhabited by tree spirits (cards). Playing spirits (cards) from their hands causes the 'Druid's Dance', and the cards move around the circle of trees, possibly hurting or helping each side in the following contest of strength between matching druids. The game is won when either player has captured two of his opponents trees either through successful druid contests or because a tree has lost all of its tree spirits.&#10;&#10;Druidenwalzer is part of the Kosmos two-player series.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.87676;2.381;2;2;45;12;Card Game
378;Lancashire Railways;"Lancashire Railways is a train game about the birth of the first commercial railroads in Central England in 1829. The Silicon Valley of its day, Manchester was the hub of advanced engineering and manufacturing. Liverpool was the largest port and Manchester needed access for its exports of Cloth and Machinery. Lancashire Railways is set in this era of unrestrained growth and development. Each player starts a railway, and attempts to acquire right-of-way at auction. Players may finance their acquisitions with loans from the Bank, although the interest rate may become exorbitant.&#10;&#10;Lancashire Railways is the first game in the Early Railways Series and is the progenitor of later Wallace titles such as Age of Steam and Railroad Tycoon.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.89167;3.1429;3;6;120;12;Economic, Trains
380;Polarity;"Once rare and mysterious, now thankfully back in print, Polarity is a 2-player game using lots of magnets (so keep it away from credit cards, watches and so on). The plastic coated pieces look like Reversi/Othello discs, with black and white faces. Each piece contains a magnet, with the black side being North and the white side being South. Each player gets a stack, one plays black one plays white. A neutral red piece goes in the center of the game cloth and players start by place five each of their stack around the cloth. These flat pieces are the foundations.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you take one piece from your stack into your hand, then bring it to bear against one of your foundations. You keep your color face up, so the opposing polarity bears against your foundation piece. This way, you can very carefully balance your new piece in the air against the foundation stone! This is just fantastic to see. The board fills up with lots of discs teetering at 45 degrees, ready to fly about if the balances are upset.&#10;&#10;Get it right and your stack is one piece smaller. Make a mistake and  your turn ends. Either a piece falls flat somewhere (becoming a new foundation) or pieces jump together making towers or into your hand. Your opponent takes the tower you accidentally made and places it their side up where they like. Towers get you points at the game end.&#10;&#10;If a piece jumps to the stone in your hand, they both go back on your stack. The game ends when one player finishes their stack and points are calculated based upon towers and discs remaining. Causing the red piece to jump to another loses you the game outright.&#10;&#10;To be honest, the scoring matters less than the tension and joy of watching the natural but weird force of magnetism at play. Because the discs are discs, they can easily roll around, causing domino effects. Because the towers increase the magnetic pull, they make it so much harder to find a safe spot to play.&#10;&#10;If you want a strange fun game to amaze your friends and family, Polarity is hard to beat. If you want a serious 2-player game, you may prefer other abstracts. The rules could do with being shorter and simpler. Otherwise, a joyous game.&#10;&#10;Comment from the designer &quot;Polarity began as a sculpture. Polarity is zen. It represents that point where absolute opposites merge. In this case, the poles of the magnetic field. The quality of play is determined by one's ability to perceive balance in the midst of extremes. Each game is unique and can never be reproduced. It is in that uniqueness that I was awarded a patent from the U.S. Pat. &amp; Trdmks. office for magnetic principle. The strategy must be viewed 3-dimensionally. It is not just control of a 2-dimensional board but must include the space above and below the playing surface.&quot;&#10;&#10;";1986;6.34947;1.6814;2;4;20;8;Abstract Strategy, Action / Dexterity
382;Heimlich & Co.;"The game board in Heimlich &amp; Co. is an oval movement track, with points allocated to the various spaces. Seven differently colored &quot;spies&quot; are placed on the board. On a player's turn, they roll a die, then move any combination of characters forward that number of spaces. The newly-moved spies then score points based on their new location. However, the trick here is that each player's color isn't known until the end of the game, so players are encouraged to deduce which color belongs to whom.&#10;&#10;Heimlich &amp; Co. includes advanced rules which allow players to score more points at the end of the game for correctly guessing everyone's identity.&#10;&#10;(&quot;Heimlich&quot;, by the way, is a German adjective meaning secretly or slyly.)&#10;&#10;";1984;6.46989;1.4745;2;7;30;8;Bluffing, Spies / Secret Agents
384;TurfMaster;"Turfmaster is a horse-racing game for two to eight players, played over a &quot;meet&quot; of three races.  The board is two-sided, and hurdles are provided so that players can choose flat racing or steeplechases (races with fences that the horses must jump).&#10;&#10;Players each have their own deck of 32 movement cards, dice and a horse of their own colour.  Ten cards are randomly selected for each race, with two cards left over which can be drawn for use in any one race.  Cards played in a race are removed from the game.&#10;&#10;A round consists of two parts.  First all players simultaneously select a card and move the number on the played card (if able), in position order.  After this, a single pair of dice is rolled by one player (the rolling player rotates throughout the game).  The player rolling the dice decides if all horses move the value of one or both of the dice and all horses move (again in position order).&#10;&#10;Like a real horse race, inside position is important.  The game has rules for lane changing, blocking and handicaps on the leaders which restrict the values of the cards the players whose horses are in the first three spots are able to play, or how much (or even IF) a horse in one of those spots can move on a dice roll.  To try to counter this, players have &quot;joker&quot; cards which can be used to avoid being handicapped when in one of the first three spots.  The steeplechase introduces additional rules for jumping fences.  Horses can be forced to pull up short of a fence (because they are blocked on the other side and have nowhere to land safely) or can occasionally fall if their movement ends on a fence - which takes four movement points to jump.  Players will need to plan their moves carefully to prevent other players from getting their full amount of movement, and to avoid having players doing that to them.&#10;&#10;The first four horses to finish each race are awarded points towards their final total.&#10;&#10;The game comes in two versions.  The regular version which has single-colour plastic horses, and the &quot;DeLuxe&quot; version which has hand-painted pewter horses (each jockey wears a different coloured jersey) - each in a little protective case.   In addition, several other tracks are available - there are two course collections which can be purchased separately and a third (web-published) collection.&#10;&#10;";1998;7.24914;1.949;2;8;75;10;Animals, Racing, Sports

388;Finale;"Another game in Kosmos two-player series, this game casts players as soccer (football) coaches on opposite teams.  Players use special square cards to represent the players they have in each of the positions: strikers, mid-fielders, defenders, and goalies.  Each turn, one of the two players will be the offense based on a simultaneous selection of cards from their respective play books.  Then players allocate their players to the current play, which rotates the used players.  A player card has a number of soccer balls on each edge, which tells how many skill points the player will contribute to a given play, and using the player (thusly rotating him) might actually weaken him for the next use.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented as:&#10;&#10;    Tooor!&#10;&#10;&#10;";1998;5.74142;1.8611;2;2;30;12;Card Game, Sports
392;Brawl;"From the Cheapass Games web site: (6 November 2011)&#10;&#10;History: In 1999, James Ernest refined his notion of Real Time card games. Building on his first real time card game, Falling, which was multi-player with a dealer, he created Brawl, a two-player card game with no dealer.&#10;&#10;Summary: Brawl is a lightning-fast combat game where two players burn through their 35-card decks in about 35 seconds. Each deck contains a unique mix of cards, and each deck requires a slightly different playing style to win.&#10;&#10;Mechanics: Each player takes one deck, sets a &quot;base&quot; card on the table, and begins to play. Players play their cards (Hit, Block, Clear, etc.) as fast as they like, trying to win each Base by playing more Hits on their own side. At the bottom of both decks are three Freeze cards. When every base is Frozen, the game is over.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.36668;1.3661;2;7;15;10;Card Game, Fighting, Print & Play, Real-time
394;Kahuna;"&quot;Who will rule the South Seas? Two Kahuna - ancient sorcerers of the Pacific - compete for dominance on an archipelago consisting of twelve small islands. Using their magic and wisdom, they struggle for control of the islands. They anxiously await the cards handed to them by fate. But when the time is right, they move to capture one, two, or even more islands, trying to gain the upper hand. At the mercy of the magical powers of the South Seas, they quickly realize that even the best magic is no good without strategy.&quot;&#10;&#10;Originally published in 1997 as Arabana-Ikibiti by the designer's own publisher Bambus Spieleverlag, then reprinted by Funagain in the U.S., Kosmos' Kahuna &ndash; part of its Kosmos two-player series &ndash; is the best known implementation of this design.&#10;&#10;It's a two-player game, played on a board depicting twelve islands. Players use cards to place bridges between these islands or remove opponent's bridges. If you get the majority of bridges around an island, you place one of your marker stones on it and also remove any of your opponent's bridges to that island &ndash; which might cause them to lose a bridge majority on an adjacent island and lose a marker stone there.&#10;&#10;The game is played in three rounds. A round ends when all cards from the face down deck and the three face up cards have been taken. Then points are scored for the islands with a marker stone on them. The game can also end sooner when one player has absolutely NO bridges left on the board.&#10;&#10;The Kosmos edition has excellent graphics and nice wooden pieces and plays very well.&#10;&#10;Reimplements:&#10;&#10;     Arabana-Ikibiti&#10;&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;     Kanaloa&#10;&#10;&#10;";1998;6.6128;2.0542;2;2;40;10;Abstract Strategy

Similar to Kramer&#039;s other creations, 6 Nimmt! and Hornochsen, players are putting positive and negative cards into groups and either trying to take the resultant points, or avoiding the subject all together.

398;Wildlife Safari;"Wildlife Safari was originally published by AMIGO as Flinke Pinke. This game is one of those 'painfully simple' Reiner Knizia games. There are five different colored chips, with six cards, zero through five, in each of the colors.  The cards are dealt out, and then players take turns playing a card and taking any available chip.  When one color has all six cards played on it, then the game is over, and players use the last card played in each category to value their chips.  The highest total value wins.&#10;&#10;Description of 1994 Milton Bradley re-issue Quandary, for 2-4 players:&#10;&#10;A game of placement, shares and nerve by Reiner Knizia, this is a lovely edition with nice, heavy tiles akin to Mah-jong pieces in weight and feel. Players in turn lay numbered pieces on tracks curling to the centre, and then take a share in any colour. The round ends when a track is filled. Scoring is based on your total share multiplied by the value of the final tile played on each track. So if you are collecting blue shares, I'll try and lay a blue 1 as near last as possible. Then you'll want to play a blue 5 to raise your possible score, but must take a share in a different colour. Same game, different production.&#10;&#10;Description of 2003 Fantasy Flight Games re-issue, Loco!, for 2-4 players:&#10;&#10;Here is the FOURTH version of the game that was originally Flinke Pinke only this time, the added &quot;rule&quot; is that whenever you play a card with a value of &quot;0&quot;, you must say &quot;Loco!&quot; aloud or forfeit your opportunity to select one of the colored chips.  Apart from that, the game is identical.&#10;&#10;Description of the 2010 Eagle-Gryphon Games games re-issue, Botswana, for 2-5 players:&#10;&#10;This fifth version of the game adds a safari theme. Rules and gameplay are unchanged from the original version (no rules about animal noises), but the chips are replaced by plastic animal figures and the cards are covered in matching animal fur patterns.

All other players move their worms according to their dice, taking the appropriate number of discs from the back of the worms and adding them to the front, sometimes curving a bit in an attempt to cut off other worms' movement.&#10;&#10;";1994;5.87898;1.0964;3;5;20;7;Animals, Children's Game, Racing

Each turn, players select a card from 2 to 10, which is the number of spaces they're moving. After these are revealed remembering that players cannot duplicate a card played by someone previous, players move forward down the road. Each of the cards allows for a certain number of road tile placements from your supply, a number of maneuvers per turn, and the damage your current speed will inflict should you careen into another car. Additionally, a percent of the tiles have special actions associated with them, which give the car on them the ability to jump, or hit a semi-truck, or skid out of control, or just plain slow down 'cuz there's a Smokey comin' on his flipside... The game is over when a car reaches the edge of the table, which gives the game a variable ending.

Each player takes a turn moving the single pawn around the board. Once you land on a space, another player draws a card (each with 6 categories on them), looks up your die roll on that card and reads the corresponding category. If you landed on a 15 or 30 you have that many seconds to think of as many words in that category as you can and for each word you can come up with, you cover the appropriate space on your plastic board with a chip. The aim is to be first to fill all 25.&#10;&#10;If you land on a hand, you get 15 seconds and choose another player. For every word you think of you can pull a chip off of their board that starts with the appropriate letter. If you land on the 2 space you can cover 2 spaces on your board for free (handy for Q and X, Y, Z).&#10;&#10;The timer is obnoxiously loud by intent (very distracting) and flips over very suddenly, scaring people who aren't used to it, to mark the end of the time limit.&#10;&#10;Basically, this is a very simple word enumerating party style game that's quick and easy to learn and frustrating for people with poor vocabularies or stalled minds.&#10;&#10;Many years ago, while still known as Nelospelit, Tactic already used the title Ord Mani for an earlier word game; these are different games, although some similarities do exist.&#10;&#10;";1992;6.11365;1.5;2;4;30;9;Party Game, Trivia, Word Game

430;Asterix: Das Kartenspiel;"The year is 50 B.C. Gaul is entirely occupied by the Romans. Well, not entirely... A simple card game themed on the famous comic graphic novels, with indomitable Gauls bashing unfortunate Romans. Players have a set of cards (Asterix, Obelix, Getafix, Cacofonix &amp; Vitalstatistix) numbered 1 to 10, each card having a different combination of 1-4 magic potions to act as a tie-break. A deck of 55 Roman soldiers, ranging from the cook to Crismus Bonus &amp; Julius himself, are competed for in turn. A scoring card is shown, players select their Gaul cards and show them together, highest wins the Roman and discards their winning card. The other players return their cards to their hands to fight again. There are also Pirate cards which reduce your winnings and Dogmatix cards which allow the players to draw from the deck and either keep the card themselves or pass it onto another player. The rank of the Roman increases your score, but combinations of the same rank are worth much more.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    The Gnumies &#10;&#10;&#10;";1990;5.97;1.1333;2;5;30;8;Bluffing, Card Game, Comic Book / Strip
432;Take 5;"In 6 nimmt!, a.k.a. Category 5 and many other names, you want to score as few points as possible.&#10;&#10;To play the game, you shuffle the 104 number cards, lay out four cards face-up to start the four rows, then deal ten cards to each player. Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; specifically, each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that's below the card's number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in its row.&#10;&#10;In addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value. After finishing ten rounds, players tally their score and see whether the game ends. (Category 5 ends when a player has a score greater than 74, for example, while 6 nimmt! ends when someone tops 66.) When this happens, the player with the fewest points wins!&#10;&#10;6 nimmt! works with 2-10 players, and the dynamics of gameplay change the more players that you have. One variant for the game has you use 34 cards, 44 cards, 54 cards, etc. (instead of all 104 cards) when you have three, four, five, etc. players. This change allows you to know which cards are in play, thereby allowing you to track which cards have been played and (theoretically) make better choices as to which card to play when.&#10;&#10;";1994;6.97488;1.1915;2;10;45;8;Card Game, Number

436;Canyon;"Canyon is a trick-taking game in which players try to predict exactly how many tricks they will take.  The number of cards in a hand increases and then decreases in size.  A correct prediction gives your marker movement points around a scoring track depicted on a river in a canyon, whose main feature of interest is a section of &quot;rapids&quot; near the finish line where your marker will be &quot;caught in the current&quot; and sent back a few spaces if you go too many hands without a correct prediction.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Bid & Bluff&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Grand Canyon&#10;&#10;&#10;";1997;6.24934;1.5676;3;6;45;10;American West, Card Game, Racing

The detectives &ndash; that is, the remaining players acting in concert &ndash; move around similarly in an effort to move into the same space as Mr. X.

440;Zoff in Buffalo;"Once a year, Buffalo City goes beef crazy. Cowboys drive their cows here to the biggest auction in the Wild West. The players must attempt to find grazing for their cows on the limited pasture.&#10;&#10;Which beef baron will most cleverly play his cards?&#10;&#10;Players have 10 cards to play which specify a number of cows.  Each round features a simultaneous selection of 2 of the 10 cards and a designation of which of the several pastures (the number of pastures in the game depends on the number of players) you'll try to place the cows in.  The tricky part starts with the rule that no two players can ever have exactly the same number of cows in a given pasture.  So if you plan to put 4 cows in a certain pasture, but somebody else has exactly 4 there already when your turn comes around, you'll only get to put 3 of them in -- and if somebody else has exactly 3 there already, you'll only get to put 2 of them in.  And it's very detrimental to your gameplan if you don't get to play all the cows you're entitled to!&#10;&#10;When a pasture is completely filled with cows, there are bonuses paid in the form of a chance to put extra cows into other pastures, but perversely, the better bonuses go to the players with the second or third most cows, not the first most.  This is the *really* tricky part.&#10;&#10;The game ends after five swift rounds and all 10 of your cards played, maybe half an hour from start to finish. Whoever has the most cows in the pastures wins!&#10;&#10;";1998;6.37039;2.0323;2;5;45;12;American West, Farming
442;Um Reifenbreite;"Translating as &quot;By the Width of a Tire,&quot; this game covers a Tour de France-type of bicycle race.  Each player takes control of a four-member racing team, and the goal is to score as many points as possible for the whole team.  Movement is primarily handled by dice, however a limited card set partially replaces die results.  Once you add unique rules which allow riders to draft one another and multiple kinds of road surfaces, this game has much to offer race fans.&#10;&#10;Homas Tour is the original edition of the cycle racing game later known as Um Reifenbreite. Many copies of the original game were destroyed in a warehouse fire in 1979. The combination of its sudden rarity and recognition as a good game meant that Homas Tour was (and is) very desirable, particularly to collectors.

444;Escape from the Hidden Castle;"Although billed as a children's game, Escape from the Hidden Castle, a.k.a. Midnight Party or Hugo, is actually quite enjoyable by adults as a light, fun game. Each player controls a number of guests at a party, with the number of guests dependent on the number of players. These guests start the round in the spaces of the gallery on the game board, one guest per space; this initial placement is a large part of a player's strategy.&#10;&#10;The Phantom (or &quot;Hugo the ghost&quot; in earlier versions) starts in the cellar, then climbs the stairs towards the gallery where the guests circle. The mechanism for the Phantom's movement is simple: On a player's turn, he rolls a special die. If he gets a number, he moves his pieces; if he gets a Phantom, the Phantom moves. This means that with more players in the game, the Phantom moves a lot more frequently, so you must adjust your strategy accordingly.&#10;&#10;Once the Phantom has reached the gallery, the guests can start ducking into rooms adjoining the gallery to avoid him, with only one guest per room! A couple of rooms are special in that they add or subtract extra &quot;fright points&quot; from your score. As the Phantom catches up with the remaining guests, they are sequestered on the stair steps, then in the cellar. The first guest caught &quot;earns&quot; the most fright points, with those caught later in the round earning less and less.&#10;&#10;Once all the guests have been caught, the fright points are tallied. After playing a predetermined number of rounds, the player with the fewest fright points wins!&#10;&#10;";1989;6.23869;1.1314;2;8;30;8;Children's Game
446;Avalanche;"Players take turns dropping their marbles down the channels of the game, trying to get as many marbles as possible to fall out the bottom.  Impeding the motion of the marbles are several plastic gates.  The gates catch the first marble that hits their top (subsequent marbles roll off) and swing back and forth when a marble hits their base.  Using logic, players deduce which way the gates will move when they drop their marble, and try to make a move that results in the most marbles making it to the bottom of the game (or that blocks a potentially good move by their opponent).&#10;&#10;";1965;5.6875;1.1923;2;6;30;8;Abstract Strategy, Action / Dexterity, Children's Game

You score for sets, and deduct points for cards left in the hand.&#10;&#10;";1994;5.05565;1.1905;2;5;30;8;Card Game
454;Tante Tarantel;"Tante Tarantel (Auntie Tarantula) scoots round her web, gobbling up your insects as they try to escape. The web is a spiral.  You roll the die to move Auntie, and then take turns to move one of your bugs towards the exit space. Initially, Auntie is in a good mood; if she runs into bugs, they go back to her larder. However, as soon as someone escapes, she loses her temper and kills anything she catches! The game has a scoring track.  Each time a bug is caught or escapes, a marker moves up the track, adding to the die roll and making Auntie run around the web faster and faster. Players can share some spaces, but often bump each other back and forth. Naturally, nasty bugs can push others into Auntie's path to certain death!&#10;&#10;The original set had wooden pawns for the bugs, but D&amp;F issued a series of neat rubber bugs, which add to the game's style.&#10;&#10;";1991;6.18107;1.2667;3;5;30;10;Animals, Children's Game

Players draw and lay cards in sequence, Movement, Location, Info, Action, Detectives and Villains. So I might take a train to the Country, find a clue and use a Disguise. I can use an Inspector, Arrest or Alibi card on my opponents and so on. Play ends either when an Arrest successfully reveals a Villain, or when a player discards their last card, a Villain, who Escapes.

460;Railway Rivals;"This is a classic simple railway racing game, perhaps the first modern railroading game, where you draw the railway lines on hex-board. This one uses the sort of colored marker pens you can wipe off with a damp cloth after the game. The game goes through phases; initially you draw tracks and earn money for linking cities. When a number of cities are joined, you start racing, the cities being chosen randomly. The races are simple dice-rollers and the 1st &amp; 2nd place get prize money. After a couple of races, you draw some more tracks, then race some more and so on.&#10;&#10;The railways cost more if you go over mountains etc, but this gives you shorter routes. You can run parallel to other lines at a cost, or simply link into another player's track and rent the tracks of other players when you race.&#10;&#10;The board has a UK map on one side and a US map on the other, both giving amusing challenges, and the game has good repeat value. The designer David Watts has published a lot of stand alone Railway Rivals maps, and there is another edition of this game, Dampfross published by Laurin.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Dampfross&#10;&#10;&#10;";1979;6.71067;2.325;2;6;90;10;Racing, Trains
462;Esels-Rennen;"First issued in 1989 for fewer players, the second edition (released in 1996) is for 2-6 players. The board has two sides, for racing either 3 or 4 colored donkeys. Players are given a card secretly, each showing the donkey's finishing order, a different result for each card. The board shows a patchwork of steps across a field from start to finish, each space with a colored arrow matching the donkeys. When you move a donkey onto a space marked with a green arrow pointing left, you then move the green donkey one space that way. If that space then has a blue arrow pointing right, you next move the blue donkey on one space that way. This goes on until you cannot move the final donkey because it is blocked. Eventually, the donkeys cross the finish line, and the player with the best matching result on their card wins. More of a competitive puzzle than a game, it is a nice diversion, but awkward because the donkeys constantly fall on their sides.

The board is filled with checkerboard-style squares around the billabong in the middle.&#10;&#10;To start, everyone takes turns placing their five kangaroos on an empty square behind the stream that serves as the race's start &mdash; and finish &mdash; line. On your turn, you move one of your five kangaroos, usually moving it in a jump or series of jumps over the other kangaroos. Jumps can be long, but they must take a specific format; for example, if the kangaroo to be jumped over is five spaces away from your current location, your landing space must be five spaces beyond this kangaroo. You can jump over only one kangaroo at a time, but you can make multiple jumps on a turn as long as each jump is along a straight line (whether orthogonally or diagonally) and it does not pass over the billabong. Your other option &mdash; moving a kangaroo just one space &mdash; is usually used as a positioning tactic for a subsequent move.&#10;&#10;The first player to get all five kangaroos around the billabong and over the finish line wins.&#10;&#10;";1992;6.82834;1.8784;2;4;30;10;Abstract Strategy, Animals, Racing
466;Inkognito;"Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;The goal of each agent in Inkognito is to complete a mission, together with his partner. At the beginning of the game, however, players don't know which mission they must fulfill!&#10;&#10;In the standard four-player game, each player guides one of four secret agents. The four characters are allied in pairs: Lord Fiddlebottom and Colonel Bubble are always partnered against Agent X and Madame Zsa Zsa. Each of the four agents is represented by one of four different figures, with different builds: tall, short, fat, thin. Only one of them represents the actual character controlled by a player. The other three figures represent spies which are friendly to him and that are trying to confuse the opposition.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player shakes the Phantom of Prophecy randomizer to determine his three available actions, e.g., moving on a land route or a sea route. The player moves his figures, trying to reach spaces already occupied by the other players' figures or the Ambassador. When&#31; figures are in the same space, the current player gets the right to &quot;ask questions&quot; and inspect some of the cards of that player. By deduction and a logical process of elimination, he can draw conclusions as to the identity and intentions of the other players.&#10;&#10;The &#31;first goal of every agent is to discover which of the other players is his partner. This partner has the other half of the &quot;code&quot; indicating his secret mission. After discovering (or thinking he has discovered) the real identity of the other players, an agent must trade his secret mission card with his ally. This will reveal the final mission and what must be done to complete it. If either agent on a team completes the mission, both he and his partner win the game.&#10;&#10;There is another character with an important role in the game: the Ambassador. He can be used to get clearer information about the other characters. Everyone wants to meet him because he is well-informed and can be useful to accomplish your purposes, but he can also help your rivals, so do everything you can to keep him far from them.&#10;&#10;The 2013 version of Inkognito from Ares Games raises the maximum player count to five by allowing someone to play the Ambassador and move it during his turn. He can still gather clues when the other players question the Ambassador during their turn, and the other players can still gather clues from him. The goal of the Ambassador's player is to know everything about the other characters, guessing their identities and builds. If the Ambassador achieves &quot;perfect knowledge&quot; before a team accomplishes its secret missions, he wins the game.&#10;&#10;";1988;6.60823;2.1652;3;5;90;10;Deduction, Spies / Secret Agents

To achieve top dog status players will come across trash cans (for resupply) and fire hydrants that help in scoring more points.&#10;&#10;";0;5.5;1.0;0;0;0;0;Animals
470;Road to the White House;"extrapolated from the preview:&#10;&#10;The essence of the game is that you are moving from one to four pawns around the country, landing in cities, and scoring &quot;votes&quot; in the appropriate state which are proportional to the size of the city. Each turn, you move and add votes to the states you land in.&#10;&#10;There are many complications that can occur. You can sit out a turn and collect money. With money, you can buy &quot;organization&quot; in a state, acting as a multiplier to all subsequent votes you get in that state. You can buy &quot;advertising&quot; - most useful in buying votes in piddly states that you're too busy to visit. You can buy &quot;surrogates&quot; which are additional pawns who may travel, garnering votes, just like your candidate. You can buy &quot;special flights&quot; that help you get to places without the luck of the dice.&#10;&#10;The most characteristic part of the game comes in the &quot;issues&quot;. Each player picks a politician with his own profile on how he stands on various issues. Then either through choice or chance cards, issues become &quot;active&quot;. As long as the issue is active, politicians with a relevant stand will have bonuses or penalties when he visits certain states. The game strongly encourages role playing.&#10;&#10;The climax of the game comes at the end, as you go down each state to see who has the most votes, thereby winning that state's delegates. There is a smart balloting system, in which the lowest scoring player drops out, giving his states' votes to the next strongest in each state. This continues, with players dropping out in each successive ballot until a winner is chosen.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;";1992;6.16313;3.5455;3;6;240;12;Political

478;Citadels;"In Citadels, players take on new roles each round to represent characters they hire in order to help them acquire gold and erect buildings. The game ends at the close of a round in which a player erects his/her eighth building. Players then tally their points, and the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Players start with a number of building cards in their hand; buildings come in five colors, with the purple buildings typically having a special ability and the other colored buildings providing a benefit when you play particular characters. At the start of each round, the player who was king the previous round discards one of the eight character cards at random, chooses one, then passes the cards to the next player, etc. until each player has secretly chosen a character. Each character has a special ability, and the usefulness of any character depends upon your situation, and that of your opponents. The characters then carry out their actions in numerical order: the assassin eliminating another character for the round, the thief stealing all gold from another character, the wizard swapping building cards with another player, the warlord optionally destroys a building in play, and so on.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player earns two or more gold (or draws two building cards then discards one), then optionally constructs one building (or up to three if playing the architect this round). Buildings cost gold equal to the number of symbols on them, and each building is worth a certain number of points. In addition to points from buildings, at the end of the game a player scores bonus points for having eight buildings or buildings of all five colors.&#10;&#10;The expansion Citadels: The Dark City was initially released as a separate item, but the second edition of the game from Hans im Gl&uuml;ck (packaged in a tin box) and the third edition from Fantasy Flight Games included this expansion and can be recognized by its rectangular box (not square).

There are over 200 different pieces in the universe, each with its special function.&#10; Stratego Legends is an &quot;optionally collectible&quot; game. Each box comes with a light army and a dark army whose pieces have been chosen to work well together. However, there are rules for customizing armies (and the lands they fight upon) to specialize your attack force. There are also rules for multiplayer games where 4, 6, or 8 players can square off as two teams.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.81792;2.2642;2;8;60;8;Abstract Strategy, Bluffing, Collectible Components, Deduction, Fantasy, Memory
486;Barnyard Buddies;"In Barnyard Buddies, a bunch of cards depicting various animals in different colors are placed faceup on the table. Each turn, one player reveals a card that depicts four animals, each in a different color. All players race to figure out the animal and color not depicted on this revealed card, then grab the card on the table showing this colored animal combination.&#10;&#10;This quick, mind-crushing exercise continues until the deck is depleted. Whoever collects the most cards wins!&#10;&#10;";1996;5.68285;1.0333;2;8;15;4;Animals, Children's Game, Real-time
488;Stake Your Claim;"A gold rush themed set collection game with a simple mechanic that enables swift play. There are two variants described, a 2-6 player game as well as a 2-player version outlined in the rules.&#10;&#10;Broad appeal to children and adults due to the clear mechanics and straight-forward play.&#10;&#10;The game utilizes 44 cards in 11 groups of four different images. Players build up their 'stash piles' by 'patenting' as many 'claims' as possible. This is accomplished by collecting sets in multiple stacks by drawing from a draw pile or common pool of 8 tiles in the center of the table based on matches and placing tiles into the pool if no match can be found.&#10;&#10;Matches can also be made with the top card of piles of any other player. The end game comes when all cards are in the possession of the players, and the stacks are consolidated to determine who has the largest stack of claims.&#10;&#10;The 2-player variant involves repeat-dealing of four cards to players when their hands are exhausted by set collection from the pool until all cards from the deck have been utilized.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by: &#10;&#10;    R&#195;&#164;uber&#10;&#10;&#10;";1985;6.00141;1.0;2;6;15;6;Card Game

492;Aladdin's Dragons;"After the immediate response to Richard Breese&#039;s Keydom at Essen 1999, Hans im Gl&#195;&#188;ck contracted to take the basic game idea and produce a version of the game.  Aladdin's Dragons, or Morgenland in the original German, is the product of their cooperation.&#10;&#10;The game features players putting numbered bidding chips face-down onto the board sequentially.  After the players have placed all of their chips, then each of the areas is resolved.  The bottom part of the board is where players attempt to gather treasure tokens, which is the overall currency of the game.  The middle part of the board features a number of special actions, which help the players cast spells, trade in their resource tokens, or block other players' actions.  The top part of the board is where players use treasure tokens to purchase artifacts, and the player who can collect the most artifacts by the end of the game will be the victor.&#10;&#10;Won Games Magazine Game of the Year award in 2001.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Keydom&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Aladdin's Dragons (card game version by same name as board game)&#10;&#10;&#10;Microbadges:    (Buy One)&#10;&#10;      Aladdin&#039;s Dragons fan&#10;&#10;&#10;";2000;6.88841;2.3596;3;5;90;10;Arabian, Bluffing, Fantasy, Medieval
494;Ave Caesar;"Set in the Roman stadium Circus Maximus, in Ave Caesar, players use cards to move their chariots around a quasi-variable track. The track itself has bottlenecks and lane-changing restrictions, which make the race interesting for the racers (very similar to Detroit-Cleveland Grand Prix or Daytona 500). Players are required to race three laps, and they must stop to 'Hail Caesar' before they can finish (a pit stop). The game is light, but if you waste too many moves taking the longer, outside-routes on corners, you may not have enough movement to finish the race. Later, the game was revamped into Ausgebremst, with the most notable changes being modular boards and options to reduce the luck.&#10;&#10;The Cafe Games/Pro Ludo edition has only 2 different tracks compared to the Ravensburger edition with 2 track variants on both sides of the board.&#10;&#10;It was re-released in 2022 by DiceTree Games with deluxe components, new maps, and new variants (by the designer).&#10;&#10;";1989;6.64922;1.3588;2;6;30;12;Ancient, Miniatures, Racing
496;Dilemma;"Dilemma is a curious combination of speed, dexterity, and bluffing. The starting player places a numbered card in an arena (a plastic dish). Players place or apparently throw numbered cards into the arena. If you do this correctly so that your card covers the opener neatly, you then duel with the starter. You each have a dueling block, showing peace or war. Lay this hidden, then reveal them together:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Peace/peace means the players swap the cards in the arena.&#10;    War/peace means war takes all the cards but loses one of ten lives.&#10;    War/war means no one gains cards and both lose a life.&#10;&#10;&#10;If you have no lives, you still duel, but can place only peace. When the game ends, total up the cards you've won, and whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;";2000;4.39861;1.0;3;5;30;10;Action / Dexterity, Card Game

500;MARK;"MARK is a game about collecting, processing, and reselling recycled components for a profit. Each turn, a player rolls a pair of color dice and chooses one of the showing die colors to perform an action with. Each color is tied to one type of recyclable material. A player can choose to receive a single new recyclable good to his delivery yard, or he can choose to move a single recyclable good from his delivery yard to his treatment area, or he can choose to sell one good from his treatment area to the market grid in the center of the board.&#10;&#10;The market grid has 5 rows, and each row can hold only one variety of recyclable materials. When selling to the market, if it is the first time that good has been sold, the player may choose which row to sell into (left-most position in the row only), otherwise he must sell into the next empty space in the row that variety already occupies. He receives the amount of money shown on the space where he places his recyclable good. When the row is full, all goods of that type are removed from the game. The game ends when four of the market rows are completely filled.&#10;&#10;If the player rolls both dice of the same color, he has no choice in which recyclable material to choose, but may perform two actions (delivery, treatment, or sale) with that type of good. In addition, there are two special symbols on the dice (one on each). One is a star symbol, which acts as a wild. The player can choose whatever color he desires. The other is a gavel, which triggers an immediate auction for the type of good shown on the other die, after which the player takes another turn. The auction is a closed-fist auction.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the player's turn, he must pay 5 dollars in storage fees if he has more than 2 recyclable materials in his delivery yard. He must also pay 5 dollars in storage fees if he has more than 2 recyclable materials in his treatment area. This provides tension between waiting for bigger pay-outs and selling recyclable materials early.&#10;&#10;The player with the most money at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;";1997;6.03226;1.6667;2;4;60;10;Economic

The goal is to have your balls land closest to the mark placed on the board.  The weight of the sand and the friction of the felt causes the balls to roll, sway, or stay put, seeming to defy gravity.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.64706;1.0;2;4;15;8;Action / Dexterity

506;The Big Cheese;"An auction game in which players bid from their pool of &quot;worker rats&quot; to gain control of corporate projects.  The workers from the winning bid are then are assigned to the project.  Each turn, one worker is removed from each project.  A project is complete once all workers have been removed.  The value of a numbered project is only determined at completion by a die roll. Two other projects, Veto and The Big Cheese, allow special actions during the game. The game has two different scoring schemes, depending on whether players use a single six-sided die or a set of seven polyhedral dice.&#10;&#10;This is part of the Hip Pocket Games series.&#10;&#10;Awards&#10;&#10;1999 Listed in GAMES Magazine's GAMES 100&#10;&#10;";1998;5.8844;1.3455;3;6;30;10;Animals, Card Game, Print & Play
508;Blue Max;"In &quot;Blue Max&quot;, each player pilots a World War I airplane in a dogfight. This  wargame can be played as a campaign, with new planes becoming available as time passes, and with surviving pilots getting better at what they do.&#10;&#10;Each plane has a maneuver sheet showing which ones it is allowed to do -- some maneuvers can only be executed by ace pilots, and other maneuvers are &quot;restricted&quot; in the sense that they can't be repeated from one turn to the next (the plane would stall).&#10;&#10;If you &quot;tail&quot; another plane, its pilot must show you whether he's going right, left or straight ahead. You get to shoot ahead of your plane, unless you have a bomber with an observer/gunner in the back (swivel-mounted guns). Damage is rolled on a table that determines severity in terms of blue and red hits; you then draw the indicated number of coloued chits from a cup. Hits are taken to the wings, tail, engine, etc. There's a chance the pilot is killed, or that the plane catches fire.&#10;&#10;Fuel eventually runs out and the pilots fly off to meet another day --if they survived. &#10;This is a lot of fun with massive numbers of players; you can put the 20-odd planes on the map at once, balancing the better airplanes with weaker pilots.&#10;&#10;The second edition introduced crude altitude rules, and in 1995 GDW put out full-blown miniatures rules.&#10;&#10;The 2014 edition of Blue Max had substantial changes, and can be found with its own game page HERE.&#10;&#10;";1983;7.17164;2.2673;2;6;60;13;Aviation / Flight, Wargame, World War I
510;Eschnapur;"Eschnapur is a game where players explore an Indian temple and try to discover the secret treasures hidden within.&#10;&#10;The game is a mixture of a variety of mechanisms; discovery chips, movement tiles, supply tiles and symbol cards. The game board shows a top-down view of the temple, showing a path through the temple off which are many niches holding the treasures. The pathway has stepping stones marked with a variety of symbols, one in front of each. To open the niche you must have the right symbol. To move around, you must spend footprint tiles. To obtain these, the player must reveal 2 supply tiles, keeps one and auctions the other. Players bid with anything they have, tiles, coins, cards.&#10;&#10;Sounds confusing? It is. You must win auctions to get the stuff you need to win more auctions and move and open niches and collect treasures to score points to win the game.  It might take a player a while to figure the true value of all of the items and how it all fits together, but once a player has the idea, the game really works.&#10;&#10;";2000;5.66924;2.3529;3;5;60;10;Exploration
512;Holiday!;"In this game, players attempt to guide an airplane around the world as the calendar progresses from day to day.  Players hold a hand of cards, each stating a city and day-of-the-week combination.  Their goal is to have the plane reach their destination as close to their card's day as possible.  (E.g. if I hold &quot;Paris - Tuesday&quot; then I'd like the plane to reach Paris on Tuesday, not on Saturday--it's worth more points that way).&#10;&#10;The method by which the plane moves is based on an auction.  Each round, players bid for the right to choose the plane's next destination (each player starts with a fixed amount of money and cannot earn any money during the game).  Movement is restricted to only adjacent cities.  Sometimes a player will receive a windfall when an opponent pays for the privilege of moving the plane but moves it to a place where it's beneficial to both players.  At other times, a player will see the plane start moving away from the area of the world preferred.&#10;&#10;Play continues until all players are out of money or one player has played all of his or her cards.  Most victory points earned (as the cards are played) determines the victor.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented as:&#10;&#10;    Shanghai&#10;    Maloney&#039;s Inheritance&#10;&#10;&#10;";1973;6.73872;2.0;2;8;40;8;Aviation / Flight, Travel

518;Cat vs. Mouse;"Cat vs. Mouse lets players &quot;Recreate the classic cartoons you grew up with and pound on your friends at the same time!&quot;.&#10;&#10;The game is for 2-4 players and each player gets a &quot;team&quot; of 1 cat and 2 mice. The main object of the game is to get 10 points, mostly by having your mice get food from the refrigerator back into the mouse-hole. The board is the layout of a house with the mouse-hole on one end and the refrigerator on the other end. Your mice try to get food and your cat tries to stop the other team's mice from doing so. There is a dog counter which can be moved each turn, and you use it to try to go after the opponent's cat. In terms of fighting, you can only fight an enemy (The mouse's enemy is the cat, the dog's enemy is the cat, and the cat's enemies are the mice and the dog). You can also pick up items throughout the house that you can use during combat to modify your strength. If you defeat one of your enemies in combat, it is considered &quot;Clobbered&quot; and cannot function until the next turn. Most items give a strength modifier but some items have special effects. In the basic game, you get 4 points for having your mice get a piece of food back to the mouse-hole, and 1 point when your cat clobbers an opponent's mouse. Optional rules include rules for variable points for the different types of food (cheese, drumstick, apple)&#10;&#10;";2000;6.14286;0.0;2;4;30;10;

524;Desperados;"Desperados is a partnership game where players in teams of two must work together to get the most points. In Reiner Knizia&#039;s first published game, there are nine mine-opening cards and nine mine-closing cards.  To score any points you've got to play gold, silver or copper cards onto the corresponding open mine and then close it.  Trouble is, your opponents can close your mine before you want or even try to steal it with bandit cards -- a tough gauntlet to run, but here and there a few points trickle through and into the scoring column.  On your turn you either play a card OR draw a card -- not both -- making this rapid-fire card game move at its own special pace, which is very quickly indeed. It was designed primarily for partnership play, and appreciated best by players with good partnership skills. For players who do not want a partnership experience, there are variations for 2 or 3 players.&#10;&#10;Originally published as Digging by Hexagames in 1990 (Later by Avalanche Press with new pictures on the cards and a trivial rules tweak).

526;Abalone;"This beautiful and functional board has room for two teams of large marbles. Players take turns pushing the marbles around the board, with the goal of pushing six of the opposing player's marbles off the board. The central idea is that a column of marbles has weight given by the number of marbles in line. Someone will need to push with a heavier group of marbles in order to push the column along that axis. However, with six possible directions, it's difficult to defend yourself perfectly. Also, it's possible to play the game with up to six players when supplemental marble sets are purchased.&#10;&#10;A winner of the 1988 Concours International de Cr&#195;&#169;ateurs de Jeux de Soci&#195;&#169;t&#195;&#169;.&#10;&#10;";1987;6.47995;2.1559;2;2;30;7;Abstract Strategy

This is mostly accomplished by jumping one ball over one or more others, Checkers-style, on a hex board. A player's turn consists of either jumping (which can be forced) or placing any color ball on the board and removing an empty space from the edge of the board. In this manner, the play space continually shrinks, giving the endgame an almost claustrophobic feel.&#10;&#10;This game is part of project GIPF.&#10;&#10;";1999;7.26878;2.7361;2;2;60;9;Abstract Strategy

538;Manager;"Manager is a deceptively simple game of economics for up to six players. Each player is the manager of one of the six companies, which are supposed to be manufacturers competing in the same market with identical products. (It is strongly hinted that the products are computers.) The player is responsible for setting the sale price of his product, buying machines to automate production, and buying or selling stock in any of the six companies.&#10;&#10;The object of each round--usually--is to charge as much as you can for your product without charging too much more than everyone else. Every turn starts with the players secretly setting the price for their product. The person who has charged the least gets to sell. The one who has charged next-to-least also gets to sell--as long as his price wasn't more than 1,000 DM above the person below him. In fact, as long as there isn't a 1,000 DM gap between one player's price and the next, every player gets to sell. But any player who has charged over 1,000 DM more than his next-lowest competitor--and all players who charged more than him--gets locked out of the market.&#10;&#10;The prices on the stock market vary depending on who got to sell and who didn't. The companies that got shut out of the market lose ground. The companies that sold their product gain, with the one who got the highest price gaining the most.&#10;&#10;There is room for all kinds of maneuvering in the game. After the first few rounds, you make more money on the stock market than you do running your company, so you can actually drive your company into the ground--advancing someone else's company--and come out ahead.&#10;&#10;";1979;6.39816;2.5333;3;6;60;10;Economic

The map board's Solar System Display keeps track of the 4 inner planets (Mercury through Mars) and the 9 larger asteroids along their orbits. The rest of the board is taken up by the various territorial displays; the larger planets are subdivided, plus there is Deimos around Mars, the Moon, L-4 and L-5 around Earth and Mercury's two artificial satellites --for a total of 42 territories.&#10;&#10;Leader Characters each have special powers. Troopers represent the grunts --infantry workhorses and cannon fodder. &quot;Gennies&quot; are Genetically Engineered fighters; they are stronger than Troopers but cannot leave the planet for which they were designed. Transport ships carry troops and factories between planets. War ships come as Fighters and Battlers (i.e., Bombers). Killer Satellites play the role of air defense. Factories make all these pieces - although you do have a Black Market option.&#10;&#10;As the planets move through their orbits you must plan your own moves well in advance to exploit planetary conjunctions.

550;Barbarossa;"Barbarossa, in Italian &quot;red beard&quot; was, according to its inventor, inspired by Patricia McKillip's Riddle-Master fantasy trilogy (Die Schule der R&auml;tselmeister in the German translation), in which wizards are devoted to the creation of riddles and riddle solving tournaments. In an interview designer Klaus Teuber stated &quot;As you know there are moments when you close a book really sad that it's over. After finishing the last page, you often feel like you've lost a friend -- to be somewhat melodramatic. So I was looking for a way to keep the book alive a little longer. Creating a game seemed the perfect solution. In this game, I was looking for a way to make riddles, to experiment with shapes and to let the players express their own creativity with clay.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game starts with players using modeling clay to make objects that can be guessed by the other players. Players then take turns to move around the board either by rolling a die or spending gems to choose their move. The spaces landed on determine actions. Either the other players receive victory points, or you can ask a letter of an object (What's the fifth letter of that thing?), or you can ask general questions or make a single guess until you get a NO answer. Players also have three curse stones that they can throw down twice in the game and make a guess.&#10;&#10;You make a guess by writing the word down and passing it to the owner, who answers YES or NO. If you guess right, you stick an arrow in the object and score points (5pts if you're first, 3pts for second correct guess). In addition, and this matters, the object owner can either gain points or lose points, depending on the total arrows sticking at the time. So if you make your object too easy, or too hard, you lose points, but if you get it just right, you gain. Plus, at the game end, objects lacking arrows also lose their owners points.&#10;&#10;Your objects must each represent a single specific word, which you note down in secret. Trying to think of two or three things that people will guess, but not too easily, is really tricky and makes Barbarossa a fun game. Hopefully the new edition has a better rules set, as players might get puzzled by the variety of actions.&#10;&#10;A later-developed game directly inspired by Barbarossa is  Dominic Crapuchettes' Cluzzle.&#10;&#10;Re-published by Kosmos / Rio Grande 2001.&#10;&#10;Republished by Mayfair Games in 2005, in an edition for a maximum of 4 players in a smaller-sized box.&#10;&#10;";1988;6.32134;1.5524;3;4;60;12;Deduction, Fantasy, Humor, Party Game, Word Game
552;Bus;"Prior to Essen 1999, a group of students created Splotter Spellen to sell some of their own game designs.  This game is regarded as one of the highlights of that group.  The object of the game is to deliver as many people to their destinations as you can.  To accomplish this, players place route markers on the board to connect passengers to their destinations.  However, the destination types (work, bar, home) vary from turn to turn, so you can follow certain passengers as they make their way through the daily grind.&#10;&#10;Players may buy more buses (they start off with one), build onto their bus route, bring new passengers to the city (via the trains), expand the city by adding more buildings, and run their buses. There is another option, the clock. The action board has one other clever feature. On some actions, route expansion and building, the first player to choose that action actually gets to execute the action last! Which leads to some interesting games of chicken and some painful decisions.&#10;&#10;Buying more buses allows a player to carry one more passenger every time they run their buses - hence scoring, in the best case, one more point. Depending on how the city gets built, however, finding lots of passengers on the street can be tricky.&#10;&#10;Bus routes extend from either end of a Settlers-style initial placement. Extensions are appended to either end. Routes may only run parallel if there are no empty streets at one of the ends or the line ends on the crossing as another player's end. All new passengers will arrive at one of two train stations so that is one concern when route building. One must also be careful to run by a nice mix of building types. And, when building, one must always have an eye towards spoiling other players' routes by placing a mix of building types at each of their intersection so that all of their passengers just walk! Finally, when carrying passengers, one wants to be careful to set up to carry the same passenger next turn.&#10;&#10;";1999;7.67038;3.0444;3;5;120;14;Transportation
554;La Città;"Set in the Italian countryside, La Citt&agrave; features various city-states vying for population. Each player starts with two cities and is charged with expanding the different aspects of those cities to attract larger populations.&#10;&#10;Players build farms to feed their people, quarries to finance their expansions, marketplaces to allow growth in their cities, and bathhouses to keep their people clean and healthy. Additionally, structures can be built that give the city influence in one of three categories; superiority in one of these categories causes population to shift from other nearby cities when the &quot;Voice of the People&quot; is decided at the end of each turn.&#10;&#10;At the end of six turns, the player with the most points &mdash; which are distributed for well-rounded cities, well-fed populations, and the overall size of population &mdash; wins.&#10;&#10;Note: The correct pronunciation is like &quot;Cheetah&quot;, but with the accent on the last syllable: &quot;La Chee-TAH&quot;.&#10;&#10;";2000;7.01046;3.2688;2;5;120;12;City Building, Civilization, Renaissance, Territory Building
556;7 Safari;"&quot;Lions and Rhinos and Birds, Oh my!&quot;&#10;&#10;In 7 Safari, players participate on a wild animal adventure. The mission of each player is to scout the jungle and collect as many different animals as possible, for as many points. You turn over a face-down card on a grid of cards, and replace it with a card from your hand. The catch is that each row and each column may never have more than one of each animal. Animals have different point values on their cards, and only one card will count positive points - more than one of a type will count negative points at the end. Hyenas, however are always negative.&#10;&#10;Originally Published in German as Alles f&uuml;r die Katz:&#10;The title means &quot;Everything for the Cat&quot; and may have an idiomatic meaning of &quot;all for nothing.&quot;&#10;&#10;In Alles f&uuml;r die Katz The animals in the zoo are loose and players must attempt to collect one of each type out of a face down grid which represents the zoo, but must avoid collecting any black cats which do not belong in the zoo. Adults should be sure to use the Advanced Rules to ensure an interesting game. Otherwise, the rules are the same as the English version (7 Safari).&#10;&#10;";2000;5.30841;1.1429;2;6;20;8;Animals, Card Game, Children's Game

Players have to manage their resources as they pick where they want to push the most in their fights over certain territories.  Throughout the game there are revolts against the reigning emperor and players must pick which side they will join.

561;Flußpiraten;"Produced by the company responsible for the singularly vicious Rette Sich Wer Kann (the original version of Lifeboats), this similar game has each player trying to get their pirates to the end of the river, while trying to stop the other players from doing the same.  The boats that players use have spaces for two pirates, and each time one of the occupants decides to row the boat, the rock-paper-scissors aspect of the game kicks in.  Players have the option of rowing, tossing the other player out of the boat, or attempting to beat the other pirate with a club.  Players usually cooperate at the beginning of the river to overcome the current, but as the their ship nears the end of the river watch your back!&#10;&#10;";1990;6.19043;2.1;3;6;90;9;Nautical, Negotiation, Pirates
562;Silberzwerg;"Players manage a set of dwarves mining for gems to fulfill randomly distributed contracts.  Each turn, players simultaneously decide where to send their dwarves.  Four of the dwarves are simply miners and will mine a particular color of gem, depending on placement.  Gem prices are set each round, cheaper the more dwarves that are mining it.  Players also have two boss dwarves, which can either be shadow dwarves (used to carry out evil actions on other players), or silver dwarves (usually beneficial actions for the player).  Assembling the correct assortment of gems and assigning a silver dwarf to fulfill a contract, he can score either his own contract or one of two open contracts.  Or he can assign a silver dwarf simply to sell gems for cash.  High score when all the contracts are gone wins, but usually someone wins before that happens by hitting 600 points.&#10;&#10;";2000;6.40423;2.5128;2;4;60;10;Economic

In Doolittle &amp; Waite, as in the real world of legal disputes, players deal head-on, negotiating, bluffing, and even threatening in an attempt to win the case before trial through that noblest of all legal institutions ---the out of court settlement.&#10;&#10;There are enough cards for up to 15 players, but 8 is a more practical limit.&#10;&#10;";1986;6.24552;1.8571;2;8;30;0;Bluffing, Card Game, Negotiation
564;Die Seidenstraße;"from the rules translation:&#10;&#10;In 1225 the Venezian Marco Polo arrived home from his great journey of discovery to the mysterious land of China. His accounts from the land was so overwhelmingly fantastic and adventurous, that one could hardly believe him. Yet, the precious cargo he brought with him, convinced even the most discriminating and suspicious among the Venezians.&#10;&#10;Everyone wanted to have some of the valuable goods from China. Through the Silk Road &mdash; the legendary trading route which connected China with Europe &mdash;  traders brought exquisite treasures home, most importantly, precious silk,  which no one outside of China knew how to make.&#10;&#10;But the road which led to Venezia through the Gobi desert and passing the great commercial centers of Xi'an, Samarkand, Buchara, Bagdad and Byzanz, was dangerous. This made the traders dependent on each other during the journey. Nevertheless this did not stop them from, using the right tactics and a trace of cunning, trying to gain advantages over each other. Especially in the Bazaars and at the large Trading Posts which lined the route. The first to arrive would make the most profitable deals and receive the most ounces of Silver when they arrived at the end of their trip.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.51474;1.7778;2;7;60;10;Racing

566;Wongar;"The board for this game features several square-ish areas, which each have their own draw pile.  Players each sequentially pick the top card which has the action they'd like to take.  These actions revolve around placing of control markers on the board.  There are three types of control markers that are available, and each type of marker will score each time the area is scored.  The areas are scored when either the Ancestor or the Elder tokens appear in the area, and moving either of the tokens gives the moving player the first-player status or extra scoring cards.  The scoring cards are the last element, as once an area is scored the players involved in the area use these cards to manipulate control makers in the general vicinity.  Scattered throughout the decks are scorpion cards, which ages the game to completion and increases the value of the scorings through the game.&#10;&#10;";2000;6.2873;2.9762;3;5;90;12;Prehistoric

Shortly before the opening of your pub the disaster happens. The competitors send hooligans to your premises that are about to destroy your work. You are determined to fight. Let 's hope that you have better cards than your opponents!&#10;&#10;Two teams of two or three players compete with the aim to open as many pubs as they can. But they not only try to set up their own enterprise but also to cancel the efforts of the other team by any means. For this purpose the teams can hire hooligans and bombers to threat the opponents. They can also cause other inconveniences like influenza for the personnel of the other team, pipe bursts or denial of credit. The other team can defend themselves with their own hooligans, managers or the two doormen Gaston and Gustave. Both, developing / opening of pubs and getting rid of the competitors, gain points. You have, for example, destroyed the other teams disco. Not only do the others not score points with their disco if you call a disco your own, their customers come to your premises (where else could they dance?)  and you collect MONEY (points)!! But even if you only have a simple beer garden, the bomb attack was useful for your business because the disco-dancers will visit the other pubs of the quarter if they don 't find their favorite disco, and yours is one of them.&#10;&#10;By the end of the game the most successful gastronome is obviously the one with the most points.&#10;&#10;";1997;5.5;0.0;4;6;45;0;Card Game, Fighting

Each game consists of ten hands, with the hand size shrinking by one each time, until the final one-card hand.  Along the way, trump is randomly determined and can be changed during the hand through the use of special cards.  There are also special cards that make the trump not count for a trick, others that can be declared any suit and value when played, and others that will give bonuses or penalties for taking the trick on which they're played.

On your turn you assign a movement of 6 to one car, 5 to another and 4 to the third car (on your next turn you may assign the movement allowances differently if you wish).&#10;&#10;To add a bit of racing flavor there is the option of slipstreaming (drafting). This is achieved by landing on a space marked with a chevron. If your car is directly behind another car then you may move an additional 3 spaces. If this takes you on to a space offering another slipstreaming opportunity (very rare!) then you may slipstream for a second time (but not a third).&#10;&#10;Grand Prix was also published in the compilations of Bertelsmann Buchclub in 1976 (see Jockey & Grand Prix),&#10;and in 1980 by Carlit as part of Spiele-Box .&#10;&#10;";1975;6.39091;1.3636;3;6;60;8;Abstract Strategy, Racing
574;Devil Take the Hindmost;"In this clever racing game, cars move around a 30-space track on which the spaces are numbered from 1 to 10, then 1 to 10 again, then 1 to 10 for a third time.  The cards have different powers depending on which number your car is sitting on.  For instance, a card might move you 8 spaces if you're sitting on an 8, but only 3 spaces otherwise.  Cards go in and out of your hand at a rapid rate as you play and discard your way through a series of races, and card management skills will come in handy if you've got them.  Each race goes by quite quickly, but the game consists of a whole series of races -- 11 if you play with the full complement of 3 cars each for 4 players or 2 cars each for 6 -- the gimmick being that, at the end of each race, the car that came in last is removed from the game, and the next race has one fewer starters -- and so on until the game is down to the last two cars and the last race for the ultimate victory.&#10;&#10;Originally released as Devil takes the Hindmost which has the same mechanics but is a cycling-racing game.&#10;&#10;";1991;6.42339;1.5135;3;6;30;8;Card Game, Racing

577;Parts Unknown;"Players are retail store owners who supply body parts to the local mad scientists. Viktor, a mad scientist, goes around window shopping. Whenever he stops to look at a particular type of parts, a demand for that type of part is created; all the parts at the cheapest price get sold. If there is still a demand, all the parts at the next cheapest price get sold. This continues until demand is met. If parts sold exceed demand, a surplus is created, which may put an extra townsfolk back into the population. If the demand is not met, a shortage is created which will be filled by removing a townsfolk.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players get a part from their gravediggers, and can pay for more parts. Players can buy store shelves, and stock those shelves with parts, setting them to a specific, fixed price. If parts don't sell. the may be shuffled off to the &quot;parts unknown&quot; pile, which will automatically sell at certain times at a highly discounted rate. There could be, at times, a monster on the loose which scares off shoppers, getting them to buy parts only at the cheapest price, ignoring other available parts.

586;Up Front;"Only once in a great while does a game dare to be truly different and abandon old concepts while striking out to chart virgin territory in game design. Rarer still are the instances in which these games succeed in presenting a simulation of unparalleled realism in an easily comprehended and playable format. In UP FRONT, we have just such a game. Gone are the hexes and charts of conventional wargames; replaced by innovative and attractive game components which have distilled a wealth of technical data into one of the most playable, yet detail laden formats ever devised.&#10;&#10;UP FRONT is a game of man-to-man infantry combat set in WWII Europe. In many ways, the game is more realistic than SQUAD LEADER principles in that its inherent mechanics simulate the fear and confusion of the battlefield and the inability of leadership to assert itself far better than any tactical combat game yet published. There is no playing board; it has been replaced by Terrain cards which become the &ldquo;hexagons&rdquo; of the game as players maneuver their forces via Action cards over constantly changing terrain. The scale of the game is measured in terms of relative ranges between opposing forces, with most combat occurring within a scale distance of 500 meters during the course of player turns measured in varying seconds of actual time.&#10;&#10;UP FRONT is a game player&rsquo;s game, rich in detail yet easily playable within the space of a lunch hour. However, it also contains engrossing Multi-Player and Campaign Game versions which could last a week or more. Like SQUAD LEADER, UP FRONT is an open-ended game capable of depicting endless Design-Your-Own variations of small unit actions between American, German and Russian combatants. Tanks, Assault Guns, Smoke, Anti-Tank Rifles, Demolition Charges, Pillboxes, Partisans, SS, Entrenchments, Anti-Tank Mines, Infantry Guns, Flamethrowers, Armoured Cars, Halftracks, Panzerfausts, Bazookas, Panzerschrecks, Wire, Ambushes, Radios, Artillery, Minefields, Mortars, Snipers, Starshells, Heroes, Prisoners and Fords are all accounted for. In fact, UP FRONT encompasses almost everything that the SQUAD LEADER game system has taken four gamettes to do, and does so in a far more playable format. The game can be summed up in four words: Innovation, playability, detail and realism.

587;Sumera;"This abstract includes 120 wooden squares, twelve wooden houses and thirty-two human&#10;figures in four colors for a game which is simultaneously about competition and cooperation.&#10;&#10;At the start there is a deserted, connected and fruitful land. You begin on a square of your choice and expand your territory by building on top of foreign tiles, skilfully placing your people, making useful marriages and attacking figures that get in your way.&#10;&#10;The victory formula is the number of tiles (of your colour) that are connected to your huts plus the number of your unmarried people on the board, all multiplied by the number of marriages you have concluded. &#10;Your aim is therefore to own a large territory and to make as many marriages as possible. If you do this better than the others, you become the monarch of Sumera.&#10;&#10;Credits state:&#10;&quot;With ideas from Frank Schaubrenner, Meersburg.&#10;An earlier version,The Walls of Babylon, contained a mechanism related to that of Wolfgang Kramer's Burgenland/Terra Turrium, and was shown in G&ouml;ttingen in 1987 and published&#10;by Witt Spiele at Essen in 1989.&quot;&#10;&#10;";1999;6.23966;2.6667;2;4;30;0;Abstract Strategy
589;Wiz-War;"In the light, beer &amp; pretzels type of game Wiz-War, players are transformed into wizards attempting to collect treasures from a twisted little maze. At the heart of the game is a deck of cards that the players use to cast spells, power-up spells, and augment movement. Each turn, players can move up to three spaces (or more with the use of number cards). However, the goal is to penetrate the other players' sections of the maze, pick up one of their treasures, and bring it back to your home base. The first player to capture two such treasures or kill all the other wizards wins.&#10;&#10;";1983;6.8611;1.9822;2;4;60;10;Fantasy, Fighting
590;Mille Bornes;"One Thousand Milestones. On French roads there were small marker stones giving the distance in kilometres to the next town. In this famous old French card game, players compete to drive 1000 km, dealing with hazards along the way. Draw a card to your hand, play or discard. You must lay a green traffic light to start, play cards showing mileage, dump hazards (flat tire, speed limit) on the other players, remedy hazards (spare tire, end of limit) from yourself, play safety cards (puncture proof), and try to be the first to clock up the distance.&#10;&#10;";1954;5.71492;1.2487;2;6;45;8;Card Game, Racing
592;Spades;"This trick-taking game is a standard deck playing card game and takes on many different group-specific rules.  Generally speaking, each player is given thirteen cards and a partner who sits across the table.  Each player bids the number of tricks they'll take, and then the partners collectively attempt to take at least as many as they bid.  The tricks are fairly standard with following suit if you can, and spades as the trump suit.  If you make your bid you earn ten times the number of tricks you bid, otherwise you lose that many points.  Plus there is usually a nil bid, which means you personally won't take any tricks but your partner still plays as normal.&#10;&#10;Call Break is a popular variation of Spades among card game players in South Asian countries. To win, players must score the maximum points in 5 rounds. Points equal the number of tricks bid in each hand. The player who wins that hand gains point, the loser loses the same amount of points.&#10;&#10;";1938;6.7993;2.0275;4;4;60;10;Card Game
593;Favoriten;"Favoriten is a simple betting/race game with a nifty element of press-your-luck thrown in.&#10;&#10;Five horses are involved in each of three races.  Players do not own any horse.  Rather, they each have three betting chips.  On a player's turn, she/he rolls a die and moves one of the five horses forward based on the result of the roll.  The race track pictured on the board has two lanes.  These lanes are used by the player to keep track of which horses have been moved in the current turn. At the start of a turn all of the horses shall be in the same lane. Then as a player moves the horses forward, he/she also moves them to the other lane. The player continues until they've rolled five times and moved each horse once.  The lane from where the horses started the turn will be empty.&#10;&#10;That's simple enough.  But before each turn, players are allowed to place a bet on a horse (starting with the rolling player).  After a person places a bet (e.g. &quot;I'll back the green horse&quot;) the next player can choose to or not to place a bet.  This continues until all players decline to place a betting chip.  Then the player starts rolling and moving horses.&#10;&#10;Eventually, three horses will cross the finish line and will pay out for win, place, or show positions.  The player who first placed a bet on the winning horse claims the greatest payoff.  Payoffs diminish the longer a player waited to support a horse (e.g. the second person to bet on the horse that ultimately wins pays less than the first player to back the second-place horse).&#10;&#10;The constant wait-and-see is agonizing.  If you back an unpopular horse, you'll watch it lag behind.  If you wait until everyone else is pushing a particular horse, you gain very little for joining the bandwagon late in the game.&#10;&#10;";1989;6.41249;1.3333;2;5;60;9;Racing
594;Sleuth;"In Sleuth, a classic deduction game from master designer Sid Sackson originally released as part of the 3M Gamette Series, players are searching for a hidden gem, one of 36 gem cards hidden before the start of the game. The remainder of this gem deck &ndash; with each card showing 1-3 diamonds, pearls or opals in one of four colors &ndash; is distributed evenly among the players, with any remaining cards laid face up. Thus, you and everyone else starts with some information about what's not missing.&#10;&#10;A second deck contains 54 search cards, each showing one or two elements, such as diamonds, pairs, blue opals, red pearls, or an element of your choice. Each player receives four face-up search cards; on a turn, you choose one of those cards and ask an opponent how many gem cards they have of the type shown. If you ask for, say, pairs, the player must tell you how many pairs they hold but not which specific pairs; if you ask for something more specific, say, red diamonds, the player reveals to everyone how many such cards she holds while you get to look at them in secret.&#10;&#10;Players track information on a score pad. You can guess the hidden gem at any time, or on your turn you can ask any one question regardless of which search cards you have, then immediately make a guess by marking your sheet and checking the hidden gem card. If you're wrong, you keep playing but can only answer questions; if you're correct, you win.&#10;&#10;The simplicity of the rules and the cards belies the complexity of the game. In some cases you see cards, while in others you hear only the number of cards that an opponent holds, making it tough to deduce. Any notation system you devise must be both flexible and reliable, recording negative information as well as positive in order to tick off the possibilities one by one...&#10;&#10;Reimplements:&#10;&#10;    The Case of the Elusive Assassin, with the core mechanisms of that game being used in Sleuth, minus the game board, movement and player proximity.&#10;&#10;&#10;";1971;6.90426;2.4648;3;7;45;10;Card Game, Deduction

Being absent unfortunately reduces the vizir's influence and importance at court and makes him an easy target for intrigues, and suspicions of betrayal can quickly lead to the dungeons - or to the Island of Banishing disappearing forever. Therefore a Vizir should not leave court for longer periods of time, and on his return should he always seek out the best place - such as one carrying a large number of votes (the seat-number).&#10;&#10;Only the player who is capable of balancing the various facets of the game - and most intelligently maneuvers his vizirs - will have a chance to win the struggle for subversion in the palace.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.02339;2.4;4;4;60;12;Arabian, Political

606;Pico 2;"from game review:&#10;&#10;The  game is composed of 11 cards. These are numbered 4 through 13 plus 16 and each also bears a number of &quot;pips&quot;. (From one on the 4 card to four on the 16 card.) A round is played as follows: each player is dealt 5 cards with the eleventh card discarded face-up. (Note that this means that you know exactly what cards your opponent holds.) Each turn both you and your opponent secretly select one of their respective cards and reveal them simultaneously. The higher card wins and that player sets that card aside scoring the number of pips on it. The loser retains his/her played card. However, if the higher card is more than twice the lower card then it's the lower card that is placed aside and scored. So the 13 will beat the 10 but lose to the 6. Play continues until one player is left with but a single card. Points are then scored and, here's the clever bit, players swap hands and do it again. This ensures that each game is exactly fair as both players will have equal opportunity to play a strong/weak hand. After these two rounds the points are totaled and a winner declared. There are, at most, fourteen card plays in a game and so the game is usually over in two or three minutes.&#10;&#10;";1997;5.89653;1.1515;2;2;5;10;Animals, Card Game

They use honorable weddings, weapons, cultural sponsorship and military power to increase the honor of the family (and attack each other) until one of them reaches a previously stipulated amount of honor. Whoever reaches this honor in the first place is the winner, and the new Shogun.&#10;&#10;";1996;5.93781;2.191;3;6;60;10;Card Game, Medieval

There are Roofs in each of the players' colors, which are used to score points when they cast a Shadow.  A Sun token is placed next to a Roof and will score the Roof's owner points for each Shadow placed on the other side.  The Shadows score points for the Roof's owner, and can be scored multiple times if surrounded by multiple Roof/Sun combinations.  Each turn, a player places three pieces in any combination, but must score at least one point per turn.  The game ends when one player plays his last Roof or the last Sun or Shadow is played.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.3504;2.52;2;4;70;10;Abstract Strategy
609;Ferkelei;"Players do essentially two things in Ferkelei: Shift their portfolios of stock in show pigs, and play cards to award prize money to pigs (or cause them to lose money or not to win). Many stock-based games have these features, but this game has a significant bandwagon effect. As one color of pig became active, many players would accumulate its stock, and the stockholders would naturally do things that helped each other, without forming explicit alliances. Then the color would play out, or other players would quash it or play the negative pig, and the game would move on to another color. The effect is like successive waves of popularity being washed out or dashed.&#10;&#10;More about the mechanics for those who are interested: On each turn, the player may exchange one stock chip for another or buy one. (At the start, nobody has cash to buy, so they only have their initial two chips available for exchange.) Then the player plays as many cards of one color as they like (from zero to five, except zero is not allowed if one has five or the draw pile is empty). Playing the cards can cover up competing pigs and/or bring one's favored pig to the fore, awarding it prizes depending on how far it has reached and how many times it appears on the board.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Merchants, with a number of changes&#10;&#10;&#10;";1995;5.67241;1.6667;2;5;45;8;Animals
610;Knights of the Rainbow;"Knights of the Rainbow is from FX Schmid USA. The box rates the game for 2-6, the rules rate it for 2-4, and the body of the rules refer to a maximum of five players. It is recommended that players stay within the 2-4 range, where 3 players seems ideal, otherwise the benefits of the honor cards (see below) are far too strong.&#10;&#10;Players start with seven strength, two gold, and no cards. On each turn a player can flip one, two, or three cards from the deck, keeping one of them and discarding the rest. All of a player&rsquo;s cards are kept face-up, stacked by type so everyone can see them.&#10;&#10;Players win by knocking out all opponents or having the highest score after three passes through the deck. Most of the cards are distributed among five color-coded types: strength, force, gold, magic, and honor. The player with the most cards of each type gains an advantage, usually at the start of his turn. The simplest of these increase a player&rsquo;s strength or gold, or decrease other players&rsquo; strength. The leader in magic can trade any of his cards for any card from the discard pile, or sacrifice any one of his own cards to destroy an opponent&rsquo;s card.&#10;&#10;Honor works differently. Shuffled into the deck are four &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Favor&rdquo; cards. When one of these is turned up, the player with the most honor gets two gold, two strength, or the top card from the deck. Misfortune cards are the dark side of the same coin, forcing loss of gold, strength, or cards from all players. Many cards bear a rainbow icon, however, and the player showing the most rainbows at the top of their stacks is protected from Misfortune.&#10;&#10;A player can spend gold at the end of his turn to buy another card from the deck, decrease an opponent&rsquo;s strength, or trade cards with an opponent. A player losing his last strength is knocked out of the game. Anyone who survives to the third appearance of the Long Live the King card (which triggers a reshuffle) scores a point for each magic card, strength, and gold they have. The highest total wins.&#10;&#10;";1999;4.95072;1.1667;2;6;45;10;Card Game, Wargame
611;Ironman Football;"Ironman Football is a team management game based on gridiron football in the early 1920's. That was a time when there were no TV million$, no real passing game as they played with a squashed medicine ball, shoulder padding was a sturdy arrant jumper, helmets were strictly optional and you were expected to play on both offense and defense.&#10;&#10;The game features such notable institutions as the Pottsville Maroons, the Dayton Triangles and the Frankford Yellowjackets, and mega stars like Red Grange, George Halas, Jim Thorpe and Paul Robeson.&#10;        &#10;The game works on the old system of pulling a team together, playing a series of games, whacking down some event cards and trying to obtain the best record to win the league.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game you are handed some event cards, a league franchise, a team name and, unless you are very unlucky, a handful of star players. You also get some money.   Your core players, the poor faceless grunts in the trenches, are abstracted into a simple team rating and a total salary bill (excellent idea) but the star players, the backs and ends, are each given their own individual card. As team manager, it is your job to balance the huge benefits of having these talented individuals on your staff with the interestingly high salaries they demand for performance.&#10;&#10;The three key areas of offense, defense and special teams can all be enhanced by the star cards.&#10;&#10;In addition to the player-controlled teams, who will usually play each other twice, the game also supplies a range of 'autopilot' opponents. There are league teams who are often as good, or even better, than the players' lineups and also sandlot teams.&#10;&#10;Event cards add a lot to almost any the game. They can be played either before your weekly scheduled game or during the game itself. Their effects are wide ranging; from new gadget plays that can give you an extra dice on offense, to sponsorship deals that enable you to sell out to local government for big money. There are college players, fan loyalty, rain insurance, scams, scandals, intrigue and even subtle stuff like players' agents, loyalty and defections.&#10;&#10;Once you have played the game, you work out the gate receipts, which are divided between the home team and the visitors based on a pre-agreed percentage split. There are variables such as number of star players on show, rain, home opener, whether you are playing a winning team, etc. As it is more profitable to be at home (no travel expenses) and to play the winning teams with the most star players, each team has an inherent draw factor - remember this is pre-TV - and can negotiate and earn high income accordingly. Want to play the top rated Canton Bulldogs (8-0-2, three star players) at home? You are going to have to offer their boss a healthy enticement to come to Oolong and perform against your 0-5 Indians, just to earn some money to pay off your overdraft.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, having pocketed your share of the take, you must pay all the players their salaries and if you can't meet the payroll, you will start to lose staff. They may stay on out of the goodness of their hearts, but you also need to apply to the league for a stay of financial execution and avoid bankruptcy. All this links into the league structure. If you have any sort of claim against your opponent you may appeal and have your rival reprimanded or fined, and always at the back of your mind is simply surviving game to game. You must maintain a winning record, you need to find new players to satisfy the butcher's bill of game injuries and, if you survive all that and play nine games well, you'll get a shot at the league title. Interestingly, the game can be won by other means than just having the best record. The team with the most money also gets a point, and a winning season will accrue another. It is unlikely that with a title win you'll lose, but there will be teams close on your tail.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.37766;2.25;2;8;180;10;Sports

You have to keep placing blocks until either the seesaw tips or the stack you are building collapses.  If you tip the seesaw and then blocks fall off, those blocks are given to your opponent. However, if the stack collapses before the seesaw tips, then you get stuck with any blocks that fall onto the table.&#10;&#10;In either case, any blocks that stay on the seesaw are left there to complicate future turns.&#10;&#10;Steady hands and a little knowledge of physics helps.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.95435;1.0;2;2;30;5;Action / Dexterity

Eventually this gives players enough information to deduce what is on their own cards and winning a point.&#10;&#10;The cards that the players have to guess show different numbers. Variations of the game uses letters (What's That on My Head? &amp; Egghead) and numbers combined with colors (Code 777). This results in a different question set.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    Code 777&#10;    What's That on My Head?&#10;    Egghead&#10;    Figure It&#10;    Amnesia&#10;    Guess What I Am!&#10;    Coyote&#10;    Pow Wow&#10;    Am I a Banana?&#10;&#10;&#10;";1974;6.71429;2.0;3;6;45;8;Card Game, Deduction
617;Alles Futsch;"The object of this game is to be the player with the most cash left when one other player goes bankrupt.&#10;&#10;Each player receives:&#10;1 play-table, which is placed face up in front of him&#10;4 marker stones&#10;Money worth 200,000 (3 x 50,000, 2 x 20,000, 1 x 5000, and 5 x 1000)&#10;&#10;The card holder is placed in the center of the table.&#10;The remaining cash is sorted and laid out in the bank..&#10;The object cards are shuffled and placed in the card holder.&#10;&#10;The top 5 cards are laid openly next to each other beside the card holder.&#10;&#10;If there are fewer than 5 players, the remaining play-tables and marker stones are placed back in the box.&#10;&#10;Play: Starting player selects one of the five face up cards for auction.&#10;&#10;Each player must increase the bids. Beginning with the player who selected the object card, in as many rounds as needed. Bids must increase by 1000 or a multiple thereof. Once a player passes, he may not re-enter this auction.&#10;&#10;The highest bidder pays the bank and receives the object card. The player may make change with the bank. The card will have 3 objects on it. The purchaser now has to distribute each of those objects.&#10;&#10;Three possibilities  exist for the card, each of the three objects on the card are used one at a time in any sequence desired.&#10;&#10;The sequence is decided by the player who paid for the card. Each item is released after it is used:&#10;&#10;1. An object for which he has only 0-2 copies in his collection: in this case he must take the object into his own collection. He sets one mark on the first field of the item or shifts it to the right to the next field. If this is the third type of an item, he immediately receives a bonus of 30000 from the bank.&#10;&#10;2. An object for which he already 3 or more copies in its collection. In this case he sells the object to any fellow player who has from 0-4 copies of the object in his collection. The fellow player cannot reject the purchase and must pay the seller 20000. The buyer moves his marker to the appropriate field. If this causes the marker to move to the third position, he should immediately receive a bonus of 30,000 marks from the bank.&#10;&#10;Note: the fourth and fifth objects of a type are thus always sold; one never receives these two objects from an object card that they have won for auction.&#10;&#10;Buying more than 3 types of art makes ones collection decrease in value. The buyer must pay the seller the fixed purchase price of 20000 marks and he must also pay 10,000 marks to the bank.&#10;&#10;3. A type of object which is not on his play-table (recognizably from the colored beam on his play-table at the bottom left hand corner). In this case, the auction winner sells such objects - as under 2 as described  to other players&#10;&#10;The object card is placed face up in the second side of the card holder after its 3 objects are distributed among the players.&#10;&#10;The top face down card is turned up and added to the remaining 4 face up cards.&#10;&#10;The player who purchased the last card, selects the next card to auction.&#10;&#10;The game ends the moment one of the players goes broke.&#10;&#10;First the fellow player is paid off, then the bank and then buyer receives any possible bonus.&#10;The winner is the player who has the most cash. In case of a tie, the player with more objects in his collection wins.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.28125;1.6667;2;5;45;12;Card Game

619;The Bottle Imp;"In this trick-taking game based on the short story by Robert Louis Stevenson of the same name, the goal is to gain the most points over a series of hands (usually the goal is set to 200 pts). Cards are numbered 1-37 and are found in three colors, red (comprising largely the highest numbers), blue (mostly in the middle) and yellow (mostly the lowest numbers) with colors being analogous to the suit in a standard deck.  There is one neutral card, the 19, that sets the &quot;price of the bottle.&quot;&#10;&#10;The entire deck is dealt to the three or four players in the game and then, similarly to hearts, cards are exchanged and a card is played to the bottle.  As per the usual elements of a trick taking game, players must follow suit if possible with high card taking the trick (regardless of suit).  The unique feature about this game however is how trump is determined.  Any card of value lower than the current price of the bottle (starting with 19) is considered &quot;trump&quot; and will win the trick.  If multiple cards are less than the current bottle price, the card valued closest to the current price (so highest card below the bottle) takes the trick AND THE BOTTLE, the bottle price is adjusted by the player taking the card that represents the current bottle price and replacing it with the card they used to win the trick.  Thus the price of the bottle will decrease with each trump card played, and the bottle is increasingly harder to win/purchase.  Ownership of the bottle will pass from player to player and the number of possible trump cards will decrease both as a factor of cards being played and cards being skipped as the bottle price descends.  One player will be stuck with the bottle at the end of a hand (when players have played all the cards in their hands).&#10;&#10;Cards have point values from 1-6 (not directly based on numerical value), at the end of the hand players will score points for the cards of tricks they've won, except the player who holds the bottle who will score NEGATIVE points for all the cards played to the bottle at the beginning, scoring nothing for the cards they won during the hand.  Play continues until the point goal is reached.&#10;&#10;In the 2003 edition the complete story by R.L. Stevenson http://gaslight.mtroyal.ab.ca/bottlimp.htm is included (in both English &amp; German) and the bottle is a nice wooden piece.  Earlier versions had a stand-up cardboard piece that you cut out.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.73631;1.8659;2;4;30;10;Card Game, Novel-based
620;We the People;"We the People was the first in what has become a very popular trend for wargaming.  The typically hex-based maps were simplified into an abstract system of connected spaces, which are used for army movement and to keep track of who controls the provinces politically.  The armies themselves are greatly simplified, but the general in charge of the army gains much importance through his ratings for combat effectiveness and overall strategic effectiveness.  Typically, dice are used to resolve conflicts between troops, however a deck of battle cards are used instead, which captures the feel of conflict much better and gives approximately the same results seemingly without the bitterness that accompanies skewed die rolls.  And lastly, the overall ebb and flow of the game is determined through the play of strategy cards, which ostensibly mark certain historical events during the Revolutionary War, but each card has multiple purposes depending on which side is attempting to use it.&#10;&#10;";1993;7.30396;2.7055;2;2;120;12;Age of Reason, American Revolutionary War, Wargame
621;25 Words or Less;"In 25 Words or Less, players divide up into two teams. The current clue-giver on each team looks at a list of five words that they're going to have to get their teammates to say using only words (a.k.a., no sounds or gestures). The clue-givers bid on the number of words that they need to say to accomplish the feat, with the lower bid getting the honor of doing so. If the team cannot successfully name the words in the allotted time and with the bid number of words (or less), then the other team gets the point.

The games are as follows:&#10;&#10;Game 1: Make Your Own Change Night In this one, you're all trying to score extra cash off a Zombie who's a little dim. If he hasn't got exact change for you, he'll give you more money than you gave him. Who can get the best deal?&#10;&#10;Game 2: Boneyard There are buckets of money on the table, and it's a silent auction to grab them. Your bids fall back into the buckets, and the first player who can get far enough ahead wins.&#10;&#10;Game 3: Diminishing Returns Simple, elegant, and the best of the set. Players start with the same collection of bills, and play money into a common pot until all but one player is out. It's a version of the old Cheapass standard (Fight!) played with bills in denominations of 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.27315;1.2105;2;8;30;10;Card Game

The title of the game, Business, seems like a bit of a misnomer, because there is little about business in the game.  Each turn, a set of colored chips are auctioned off for each player, however, the number of chips and color combinations are different.  Players simultaneously bid some of their bankroll to determine what order they'll pick their set.  Once all the chips have been awarded, players can cash in sets of chips for the values on cards which change every turn.

Some players complained of ambiguities in these rules and the Campaign Game became known as difficult to play, and unbalanced for 2 players to play.  Some commented that the Campaign Game felt &quot;tacked on&quot; to an otherwise excellent collection of scenarios.  General Vol. 23 Issue 4 provided official rules to help with the 2 player Campaign Game.  However, regarding the Naval Rules, an official correction (2nd Edition Rules of '81) would further complicate matters until the game designer released his own update in General Vol. 19. Issue 5.  The Campaign Game was further altered for &quot;more realism&quot; by an article in General Vol. 31 Issue 2.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;3rd Edition GameThis Unofficial 3rd Edition of the Rules compiles and reconciles all of the differences in the rules, as published by Avalon Hill over the years.

632;Cloud 9;"Cloud 9 - The Daring Game of Ups and Downs&#10;&#10;Players earn points by daring to stay in the basket of a hot air balloon as it rises. Points increase as the balloon climbs from cloud to cloud, but so does the risk of the balloon falling. Should you jump out to save your points or trust that the pilot will take you safely higher?&#10;&#10;Everyone places their passenger token into the balloon's basket to start the trip, and receives a hand of six balloon cards. Then, each turn, a different &quot;pilot&quot; rolls an increasing number of specialized dice to see if the balloon can stay aloft. The dice dictate how many of the balloon cards are needed of each color. (There are also optionally played Wild Cards to keep everyone guessing.) Each player decides whether they think the pilot will have the cards to successfully take the balloon up, or whether they should jump out and keep the points earned so far. If they stay, they run the risk of getting no points if the pilot fails. If the balloon does fall, it is placed back on the lowest cloud. Everyone hops aboard and draws one new card, and the next trip begins. When a player earns 50 points the game is over.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.48952;1.1527;3;6;30;8;Aviation / Flight, Bluffing, Card Game
634;River Dragons;"In Dragon Delta, you want to move your pawn over a system of bridge-like planks to the other side of the board. An easy task! Or at least it would be if everyone were working together, but alas you're not. Instead you're all working on your own right next to one another, each convinced that your way is best.&#10;&#10;In game terms, players simultaneously select five action cards to be performed from the nine actions available and lay them down in order they are to be played. The turn is then resolved one card at a time. The actions allow players to place plank foundations, place planks, move their pawns, cancel other players' actions, or remove planks or foundation stones. As can be expected for a design with simultaneous action selection, the game is rather chaotic.&#10;&#10;The 2012 edition of the game, River Dragons, includes a double-sided game board not present in earlier editions, with one side of the board featuring rock piles on which you place stones (as in the original Dragon Delta), while the other side has a featureless river on which players can place stones in any location.&#10;&#10;";2000;6.49158;1.7195;2;6;30;8;Abstract Strategy
635;Formula Motor Racing;"In this light racing card game the players must try to maneuver their team of 2 racing cars into the podium positions over a series of races by playing cards to manipulate the line of vehicles to their advantage.&#10;&#10;Players can advance their position by playing cards that move their vehicles up the line or drag other team cars back. More powerful cards may require the roll of a dice and can result in great gains or disastrous engine blow-outs that can put cars out of the race and cannot rejoin the fray until the next race begins.&#10;&#10;Play is quick and simple with players required to play one action per turn, carry out its effects and drawing a card to end their turn. Each race will end after the draw deck is exhausted with one final turn taking place. Points are then awarded for positions 1-6 and a leaderboard is recorded. As the game evolves the leaderboard will be forever changing and in the final race the drivers will know what they have to do to earn the points in order to sit atop the final standings!&#10;&#10;";1995;6.4124;1.1801;3;6;20;8;Card Game, Racing, Sports
636;Blindside;"A Nomination Whist variant that is played with an odd deck of cards. The deck contains the four regular suits, but each has 2 Kings, 2 Queens and 3 Jacks, 3 '10's and 3 '9's. There are also four jokers, which &#10;count as the highest trump. At the end of each hand, the players score a point for each trick made, with a&#10;bonus of ten if you make exactly as many tricks as you bid. If you bid zero and made no tricks, you score&#10;20 points - which makes zero very valuable. The game ends when any player reaches 77 points at the end&#10;of a hand: the player with the most points wins.  Each hand starts with dealing out the entire deck. Each&#10;player uses one face down card as a bid for the trump suit.  If one suit has more cards than any other,&#10;this suit becomes trumps for the hand. If not, the hand is played as No Trumps. There is a clear trade-off&#10;here between getting the suit you want as trumps and retaining as many cards as possible in the suit.&#10;However, it can also be a useful way of reducing your holding in a particular suit. Or even throwing away &#10;a high card that would otherwise win a trick, if you are going to bid zero tricks.  Once the trump suit has &#10;been determined, each player, starting to the left of dealer, states how many tricks they expect to take.&#10;This gives an interesting advantage to the dealer.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.30526;2.0;4;4;0;0;Card Game

638;Hera and Zeus;"Players are opposing gods from Greek mythology, Hera and Zeus, bent on destroying each other because each kidnapped the other's favorite mortal. Players lay out cards in opposite three-column, four-row matrices. Cards on the leading edges of the opposing columns can be used to attack, which means the combat value of the cards are compared and the loser is destroyed. However, cards are played facedown until they're engaged, adding an element of bluff and doubt to the game. Each turn, players have as many actions as they have columns, and actions can be used to attack, draw cards, or play special action cards. To win, you need to reduce the other player to zero columns, capture their hostage card from their hand, or make sure your opponent cannot use all of their actions during their turn.&#10;&#10;Hera &amp; Zeus is part of the Kosmos two-player series.&#10;&#10;";2000;6.48401;2.0479;2;2;30;12;Bluffing, Card Game, Mythology
639;American Megafauna;"From the designer/publisher:&#10;&#10;A quarter of a billion years ago, an unknown catastrophe engulfs the Earth. The swamps and ice caps of the Permian are replaced by the blistering deserts of the Triassic. On both land and sea, 96% of the animal species die.&#10;&#10;In the corner of Pangea that will be known as America, small survivors cautiously sniff the post-holocaust air at the dawn of the Mesozoic Era. Some of these unspecialized  quadrupeds have sloppy ever-replacing reptile teeth, these will be the dinosaurs. Others have sculpted &quot;one-shot&quot; teeth, these will be the mammals. The victor in this titanic  ecological struggle will determine the masters of the planet.&#10;&#10;Clearly, the ruling reptiles triumphed since that day, 248 million years ago, and dominated for 170 million years. Only to be overthrown, in what must be the upset of the eon, by the  mammals. Yet the contest is not over.&#10;&#10;American Megafauna pits dinosaurs against mammals in ancient America. The game is designed for two to four players, from  ages 9 to adult, or can be played solitaire. It recreates the titanic contest of these two types of prehistoric beasts from the  Triassic to the present.&#10;&#10;This is a game of ecology, evolution, and DNA. Players start as one of four nondescript archetypes, but can branch out to new species from this basic type by bidding on genotype and DNA cards as they are revealed. For auction &quot;currency,&quot; players use  gene coins from a &quot;gene pool.&quot; DNA cards allow players to create strange animals, from cud-chewing crocodiles with antlers, to  saber-tooth meat-eating camels.&#10;&#10;In the advanced version, the continent of Laurentia is occasionally flooded or glaciated; greenhouse levels change; and the three Milankovich cycles are handled by cards that occur with historical probabilities.

642;Oodles;"Oodles is made up of three main items... a nifty ticking electronic timer that stops when you hold the button down and starts up again when you let go of it, an extraneous plastic Oodle stick (a large &quot;start player&quot; marker), and a deck of Oodle cards.&#10;&#10;Each card has 10 questions on it, plus a &quot;Silly Starter.&quot; The &quot;silly&quot; question is asked to the player currently holding the Oodle stick and if he/she answers correctly, they begin answering the questions on the card (each answer begins with the same letter). You are allowed only one guess... so if you're wrong, the moderator calls an &quot;all play&quot; and reads the question again. The first player to guess correctly wins the right to keep answering questions on the card - in case of ties, the tied players both take a shot at the next question. The player who answers the last question correctly gets the card... and five cards wins the game.

643;Deadlands: Doomtown Range Wars;"Doomtown: Range Wars is a customizable disc game.  Each of the boxed sets contains 8 sheets of die-cut discs which may contain an assortment of combat markers, weapons and ammo, spells, cowboys, supernatural adversaries, terrain, buildings, and more. The starter set also includes a rulebook, and everything needed to play.  These sets were produced in 2000 by Fantasy Flight Games, and are set in the Deadlands game world of the wild west (but there are other themes that use the same disc mechanism).&#10;&#10;This game uses full-color illustrated discs to represent the cowboys, supernatural beings, buildings, and other accessories used in the game.  The discs are used to wage gunfights and large-scale western battles.  The discs each have game stats such as: pistol/rifle skill, hand-to-hand combat, movement, leadership, wounds, and special abilities which can help or hinder combat. This game is similar in style to many military wargames, except that the counters are much larger (1.5 to 4 inches in diameter!), allowing for amazing full-color unit illustrations, and detailed special abilities like those seen in fantasy card games.&#10;&#10;";2000;6.29207;2.2;2;8;90;10;American West, Collectible Components, Fantasy
644;Shipwrecked;"You are Shipwrecked... to survive, you must compete head-to-head in a bid for food, shelter, water, and friends. These entertaining contests require strategy, intuition, and nerve to determine who survives and who doesn't.&#10;   &#10;This is an auction bidding game. Each round, the lead off player flips over a card from the deck which will then be auctioned off. There are also Hidden Resource cards in the deck. When one comes up, players bid for the next card in the deck without knowing what it is!  Each player has 6 bid markers: 3 Pass, 2 Stop, and 1 Strike. Each round of each auction, a player must place one of these markers face down. The first round, the markers are placed in the '5 position'. This means if the auction is stopped at this position, the winner pays 5 for the item. If no one stops the auction, players place a marker in the '4 position'. Once again, if the auction is stopped, the winner pays 4 for the item. These rounds continue until the auction is stopped, or until the auction moved to the last '0 position'. Once the auction for that item is complete, the deck passes to the next player. Each time the deck comes to a player, he collects income as listed on each item card he owns. He may then choose to place an item sold back to the bank up for auction, or draw one from the deck to be auctioned. One thing that makes Shipwrecked stand out from other auction games is that you can't 'not bid'. You must participate in the auction, even if you really don't want the item.&#10;&#10;";2000;5.71049;1.4681;2;4;30;12;Card Game
645;Bosworth;"Bosworth is essentially a chess variant for up to 4 players.  The pieces are the same as chess (8 pawns, 2 knights, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, a king, and a queen), but they are represented as disks so that they can be drawn randomly from a pile.&#10;&#10;Players begin the game with 4 pawns in their edge of the board or &quot;field camps&quot; and four pieces from their draw pile as their hand.&#10;&#10;On each turn, a player must move or capture with one piece, fill empty spaces in their field camp with a piece from their hand, and then draw to bring their hand up to four pieces.&#10;&#10;Pieces move and capture just like in chess, except for pawns, which can move sideways and capture in any diagonal direction, and kings, which can capture their own pieces to escape check.  As in chess, the object is to checkmate all opponent's kings.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     GameTable Online (real-time)&#10;&#10;&#10;";1998;5.80076;2.0968;2;4;60;8;Abstract Strategy
646;Pirate's Plunder;"Pirate's Plunder is a card and dice game in which players take on the roles of pirates and engage in a life of swashbuckling adventure on the high seas.&#10;&#10;The game is played in turns.  At the start of the game, each player starts off in a lifeboat.  They have to steal a pirate ship (based on the result of a dice roll), otherwise, they are stuck in the lifeboat and have to skip their turn.  When they have a ship, players draw Playing Cards into their hand.  These cards offer maps for treasures, events to modify a pirate's guns and crews, and other ways to bend the rules of the game.&#10;&#10;A pirate's score is reflected by his treasure, which comes from the wealth-laden ships, loot, and hostages in the form of Treasure Cards.  These cards are drawn from their deck when a pirate plays a map in hand, or by making a successful &quot;Sail Ho!&quot; dice roll during their turn.  Pirates can bury their treasure to keep them safe, although they have to dig it up for it to be counted as score.&#10;&#10;Some Treasure Cards, however, are perils in the forms of deadly pirates (such as Blackbeard) and naval warships.  Players can play perils on fellow pirates, forcing them to engage in combat.  Players can also engage other players in battle as well during a successful &quot;Sail Ho!&quot; dice roll if they choose to do so instead of drawing Treasure Cards.  Such battles are resolved by comparing dice rolls, which are added to the player's number of guns or crew.  The loser's ship is sunk and the player has to start his or her subsequent turns in a lifeboat.  The winner also takes the loser's unburied treasure.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a pirate has 3,000 or more pieces of eight worth of unburied treasure and makes a successful dice roll to &quot;Sail Home&quot;, thus becoming the winner.&#10;&#10;";2000;4.56311;1.5;2;6;30;8;Card Game, Dice, Pirates

651;Zero Down;"How low can you go? In Zero, you want to score as few points as possible, but to do that you need to collect the right cards in hand.&#10;&#10;The deck consists of 56 cards, with cards numbered 1-8 in seven colors. Each player starts with nine cards in hand, and five, seven or nine cards start face-up on the table depending on the number of players. On a turn, you either knock on the table to pass or you swap one card in hand for one card on the table. After the second knock, whether from the same player or a different one, all players other than the second knocker have one final chance to swap, after which they reveal and score their hands. If you have five or more cards of the same color or number in hand, then those cards score 0 points. For each other number you have, no matter how many copies, you score points equal to that card's value. Thus, having one to four 7s in hand is worth 7 points.&#10;&#10;If, however, you manage to collect both five cards of a color and five cards of a number in hand (with one card fitting in both sets), then you can declare &quot;Zero!&quot; and end the round immediately, with everyone else scoring points as usual.&#10;&#10;After a number of rounds equal to the number of players, whoever has the lowest score wins!&#10;&#10;";1998;6.48202;1.2364;2;5;20;8;Card Game

These cover a variety of subjects (hobbies, art, business, porn and so on), and symbolize what the public wants to look at on the Web. The higher up the pyramid, the stronger the demand. Over time these change, and can even be reinforced - if the masses want cooking and nature, you give it to them. The players each try to set up their web sites, or content if you prefer, to match the demand and draw in users.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.42222;2.3333;3;6;120;12;Economic
653;Shit!;"It is a game where everyone simultaneously plays a unique number face down card a la Take 5 (6 Nimmt).&#10;&#10;There are 5 suits arranged in a circular pattern. The idea is you score the points based on the first person to hit their number traveling clockwise after the current number, e.g. if the colors are Green, Blue, Red, Yellow, Orange, Green, Blue, etc. and the current target card is Orange 6, then the first number after orange 6 wins a number of points equal to the interval. For example, orange 7 would win 1 point, but if it were not there and Green 1 were next closest, it would win 5 points. If the next closest card were orange 5 (unlikely but possible), it would score 49 points.&#10;&#10;Each player also always has in hand a Shit! card which cannot score, but playing it is the only way to get another card in hand. Strategy comes from watching when people play cards and how many they have left. Time it right and you can play while everyone else is drawing for monster points.&#10;&#10;It's a fun 20 minutes. The rules are in English.&#10;&#10;";1996;5.41835;1.1667;2;6;20;8;Card Game

Players are given a set of square cards which are to be played onto the table, which has a cardboard castle battlement layout. Cards are played into one of four regions: in the courtyard, on the battlements, on the towers, or outside the castle. And when played, the cards will usually allow you to take some sort of special action, which is unique to the card you played. The first player to rid himself of all his cards wins, which can be a tricky proposition at best.&#10;&#10;A winner of the 2000 Concours International de Cr&#195;&#169;ateurs de Jeux de Soci&#195;&#169;t&#195;&#169;.&#10;&#10;";2000;6.10077;1.9048;2;5;30;14;Card Game, Medieval
657;Münchhausen;"A pure bluffing game. Each player gets a set of cards numbered 1 to 8 and a playing mat, which goes in front of him or her. The starting player is the Baron and the other players in turn offer him a card face down from their hand, stating the value. Each player must offer an equal or higher value card than the last and the Baron must take the highest card offered or choose between equal offers. The Baron must then decide to Accept or Reject the offer. If he accepts, the Baron puts the card face down on his mat and the turn passes to the next player. But if the Baron decides the player was lying and Rejects the offer, he turns the card over. If the offer was False, the player takes it back to their hand and the Baron gets to dump one of his cards onto his mat. But if it was True, The Baron must take the card into his hand and the player dumps a card face down. When a player's hand is empty, the game is over and you total the value of the cards on your mat, subtracting any left in your hand. Highest score wins. A simple game of pure bluff, it works incredibly well. Very funny and requires some thought. Baron Muenchausen is a famous character from German folklore, a notorious liar who lived a fantastical life. The game mats show illustrations and stories from his life in German, but this has nothing to do with the actual game play and non-German readers can play the game easily.&#10;&#10;";1996;5.89414;1.0833;3;8;30;8;Bluffing, Card Game, Fantasy, Party Game
660;Riffifi;"From session report:&#10;A card game. The deck consists of five  different colored sets of cards, each set numbered 1 - 8. There are  also five matching sets of wooden disks, 10 of each color.&#10;&#10;The cards are dealt out equally to the players and they alternate playing one card face-up to the table. Unlike a trick-taking game, there is no need to follow suit; players may play any card they desire. If a player lays a card of the same color and a LOWER value as a previously laid card that round, the higher card is turned over and is out of play. When play returns to a player who still has his card face-up in front of him, he collects a number of chips from the stockpile which matches the number and color of the card he played. If his card is face-down, however, he does not collect any chips. In either case, he plays another card and the cycle continues until the players have played all of their cards.&#10;&#10;When collecting chips, if the stockpile of a certain color is depleted, the player then steals the required number and color of chips from the opponent who currently possesses the most chips of that color. Thus, each player's collection of chips is constantly in danger of being confiscated by their opponents.&#10;&#10;The basic rules call for a number of rounds equal to the number of players, with the player collecting the greatest cumulative total of chips over those rounds being the victor.&#10;&#10;";2000;6.14861;1.0;3;5;15;10;Card Game
661;Where's Bob's Hat?;"A form of estimation whist, with three colored suits (cards from 1 to 20), and the possibility of trumps or no-trumps.   You have to bid for which suit (or suits) you think you will capture most cards of, or you can bid to capture fewer cards than anyone else.   Get it right, you score; get it wrong, you take a penalty.   The number of cards per hand increases round by round, and the number of rounds depends on the number of players.&#10;&#10;From the Box:&#10;Where's Bob's Hat? is best with 3 or 4 players. Over several hands, players bid to take the most cards in one or more of the three suits, each a different kind of hat. Players who feel they will take few, if any, tricks may bid to take the fewest cards in tricks played during each hand. Players score points for making their bids and lose points for missing their bids.&#10;&#10;Several cards picture Bob's Hat in addition to the hat of their suit. When a player wins a trick containing a card with Bob's Hat on it, the player takes the Bob's Hat card (worth plus or minus 10 points). The player with the card at the end of the hand add (or subtracts) 10 points to his score.

670;Starship Troopers;"Starship Troopers is based upon the popular novel of the same name written by the dean of Science-Fiction writers, Robert A. Heinlein. In the novel, Heinlein describes a futuristic war involving homo sapiens from our Earth (Terrans) against a Humanoid race (nicknamed the 'Skinnies' for obvious physical attributes) and their cobelligerents, the totally alien Arachnids. Since this is a story of future wars and future advances in technology, much is changed in the fields of weaponry and tactics and strategy. One thing remains the same, however; the fighting still rests on the shoulders of the individual infantryman. Although great starships has shuttle men between the distant solar systems and the power of individual weapons has risen to awesome heights, wars still cannot be won unless men venture onto the face of alien planets and fight the enemy on their home ground. As Juan Rico, the protagonist of the novel, relates:&#10;&#10;&quot;We are the boys who go to a particular place, at H-Hour, occupy a designated terrain, stand on it, dig the enemy out of their holes, force them then and there to surrender or die. We're the bloody infantry, the doughboy, the duckfoot, the foot soldier who goes where the enemy is and takes him on in person.&quot;&#10;&#10;Although the mission remains the same, future inventiveness has changed the method considerably. In a galaxy-wide war, manpower is at a premium. Platoons fight where entire armies once tred. But these platoons possess the firepower equivalence of a Twentieth-Century mechanized division. More importantly, each man in the platoon is provided with a piece of hardware that allows him to fight and survive in the holocausts of future combat&mdash;his powered armor suit. As Rico describes it:&#10;&#10;&quot;A suit isn't a spacesuit &mdash; although it can serve as one. A suit is not a space ship but it can fly&mdash;a little . . . Suited up, you look like a big steel gorilla, armed with gorillasized weapons. But the suits are considerably stronger than a gorilla. If a Mobile Infantry man in a suit swapped hugs with a gorilla, the gorilla would be dead, crushed; the man and the suit wouldn't be mussed . . . The real genius in the design is that you don't have to control the suit, you just wear it, like your clothes, like skin . . . Even riding a bicycle demands an acquired skill, very different from walking. But a suit you just wear.&quot;&#10;&#10;With the suit and the incredible array of weaponry that go with it, the Mobile Infantry soldier is an exceedingly formidable opponent. He had better be. The enemies he faces are the most awesome adversaries in the galaxy. Of the two extraterrestrial races fighting the Terrans, the Humanoids are the least revolting. Rico describes them as&#10;&#10;&quot; . . . humanoid, eight or nine feet tall, much skinnier than we are and with a higher body temperature; they don't wear any clothes and they stand out in a set of 'snoopers' like a neon sign.&quot;&#10;&#10;In early scenarios they are fighting on the side of the Arachnids.  In later scenarios, after successful negotiations with Earth, they switch over to the Terran side. They're only effective fighters within the confines of their small city terrain and strong points on the board.&#10;&#10;But the 'Skinnies' were mild looking in comparison to the Arachnids:&#10;&#10;&quot;The 'Bugs' are not like us. The Pseudo-Arachnids aren't even like spiders. They are arthropods who happen to look like a madman's concept of a giant, intelligent spider, but their organization, psychological and economic, is more like that of ants or termites; they are communal entities, the ultimate dictatorship of the hive . . . But don't make the mistake of thinking that they act purely from instinct . . . their actions are as intelligent as ours (stupid races don't build spaceships!) and were much better coordinated. It takes a minimum of a year to train a private to fight and to mesh his fighting with his mates; a Bug warrior is hatched able to do this ...&quot;&#10;&#10;As the Arachnid Player, uses an Alien Control Pad sheet to record the placement of his underground central Hive cell complex and the attached tunnels radiating outward. Tunnels are used to move the Warrior units, along with Worker units mixed in as expendable decoys, to locations where they can pop up to the surface through a breach hole and attack the Terran units.  Completely unseen, and only paper recorded, Engineer units are used to create the breaches and, later, to extend the tunnels.&#10;&#10;The game is set up in a &quot;Programmed Instruction&quot; system of scenarios to slowly introduce the game concepts. Scenarios range from Scenario I, which starts players off with a basic MI raid on a Skinny city (just like the book. &quot;Flores died on the way up&quot;) to Scenario VII, The Battle of Klendathu: the final Terran assault on the Arachnid Homeworld.&#10;&#10;Warfare in the Twenty-second Century is the ultimate test of survivability of the human race.

671;Bull Run: The First Major Battle of the American Civil War;"&quot;Bull Run: The First Major Battle of the American Civil War&quot; is a tactical combat wargame of the first battle of Bull Run.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a map of the area over which the battle was fought overlaid with a hexagonal grid. Units are infantry, cavalry, and artillery, with brigade, division, and army leaders. Each turn is 30 minutes, and each hex represents 1000 ft. Units are basically regiments and batteries. Some infantry regiments with their brigade leader are capable of forming brigades, increasing offensive power at the expense of movement. Batteries can be limbered for increased movement at the expense of firepower, or unlimbered with full firepower and limited movement.&#10;&#10;Combat is a modified version of the classic system adopted by the earlier Avalon Hill games.  However, rules for leader command activation, infantry screening of artillery, and infantry forming brigades to prevent soak-off attacks, ranged artillery, rally of losses are give the game a unique flavour.&#10;&#10;The major terrain obstacle is Bull Run which provides the Confederate with defensive advantages and hinders Union movement. &#10; The game begins with the Union troops approaching partially hidden, unsuspecting Confederate forces.  As the Union attack develops, additional Confederate leaders and combat units are activated and are rushed to stem the Union advance.  The Union player wins if he is able to capture any of three objective hexes by the end of the game or takes Manassas at any time.  The Confederate player wins if he takes Centreville at any time or prevents the Union player from holding any of objective hexes at the game end.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a 32&quot; by 22&quot; mapboard, 260 counters, various charts, a 12 page rulebook and 1 die.&#10;&#10;&#10;Magazine References:&#10;&#10;The GENERAL Index  Article List:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The GENERAL Vol.20,No.5&#10;        Series Replay - Bull Run: The First Major Battle of the American Civil War, Rex A.

673;Star Traders;"from user review:&#10;Each player assumes the role of a intra-galactic merchant, traveling from planet to planet in a future where wars are unheard of and &quot;Traders&quot; are the heroes of the cosmos. The board shows 36 planets: six clustered together in the center of the board, six more in each of five arms of the galaxy. Planets are connected by &quot;jump lines&quot;: you can jump to an adjacent planet on an orange line, to a planet halfway down a galaxy arm on a purple line, and from one galaxy arm to another via green lines. The length of the jump line also indicates the difficulty of the jump, so to successfully complete an &quot;orange' jump you must roll a 2 or better on a single die, a purple jump requires a 4 or better, and the green jumps necessitate a 6.&#10;&#10;As the players scurry about the galaxy, they can pick up and deliver cargoes, which pay both in money and in &quot;Prestige.&quot; These &quot;contracts&quot; vary throughout the game, and only one player can fulfill any given contract. This isn't to say that multiple players can't pick up the named cargo, though. But only the first player to arrive at the contract's destination gets the payoff for a contract; everyone else with the cargo is now just stuck with unwanted junk, and may have to pay a penalty to dump it. Players can also build bases on the various planets as they move around. Building bases earns the players Prestige, and when a player tries to make a jump to a planet with a base, the jump is an automatic success if the player has the owner's permission. Traders obviously have permission to jump to their own bases, but if they want to jump to an opponent's, they will probably have to pay a fee. And since only one player can have a base on any given planet, bases rapidly become lucrative investments.&#10;&#10;";1987;6.34702;2.3043;2;6;120;12;Economic, Science Fiction

675;4th Dimension;"4th Dimension is a very spacey-looking game with a small circular board divided into sectors each track of which has twice as many spaces as the one closer to the center. Each player get 6 warriors, 3 rangers, 2 guardians, and one time lord. Guardians can capture warriors and rangers; rangers can capture warriors; the time lord can capture rangers and guardians; but the lowly warriors are the only ones who can capture the time lord and win the game. Captures are made by moving next to rather than on top of enemy pieces. Each piece can move only one space at a time but they can also &quot;warp&quot; by leaving the board and leaving a 4-D marker behind. The piece can then stay in the warp zone for up to three turns or warp back onto the board up to two spaces away from the 4-D marker. This game has an inconveniently small gameboard and plastic pieces that look like little futuristic chairs.&#10;&#10;The game was first published in Games &amp; Puzzles magazine. The designers produced it as a standalone game later the same year, and it was later licensed by TSR.&#10;&#10;";1977;5.3747;2.0;2;2;45;12;Abstract Strategy, Science Fiction
676;Ninja Wars;"Proudly touted as a &quot;NON-collectable card game,&quot; Ninja Wars is a simple battle game with single die rolls determining victory. Each player gets three town cards of identical strength and five randomly dealt hero cards with values ranging from 1 to 5. Players are dealt hands of five action cards they can use to attack players towns and heroes or to strengthen their own heroes and towns. Gold cards are also in the action deck which allow players to bolster the value of an attack card. Battling players each roll a die and add the  scores of either their attack and gold cards (for the attacker) or the hero/town and training cards (for the defender). Play is simple and quick for a battle card game. The randomly assigned heroes can create unfair situations, however.&#10;&#10;";1998;4.68129;1.0;2;4;30;10;Card Game, Fighting
677;Would You Rather...?;"Before they can roll and move, players must pick a card and present the rest of the players with a nasty choice between two thoroughly unpleasant hypotheticals in categories such as pain, embarrassment, ethics, and ingestion. If the player guesses the majority preference, he gets to move otherwise he must pass. Some spaces allow the player to invent their own awful hypothetical choice. The other players vote secretly on their choice in this case. If the vote is not unamimous, the player can move or send someone else back. Players roll a six-sided die and there are only 10 spaces to the goal so games go very quickly. Typical choices on the cards include, &quot;Would you rather lie naked in a bathtub full of live roaches or dive head first into a pool of tobacco spit?&quot; The answer &quot;neither&quot; is NEVER allowed.&#10;&#10;Variant:&#10;The 2003 version of this game &quot;Would You Rather?&quot; appears to have quite different rules to the above described game. There is a new simpler square board with more spaces. Unlike the 20 minutes of the above game, 1-2 hours is recommended by the manufacturer. Players roll a dice, then move and depending where they land, draw cards with dilemmas to pose to the rest of the other players. The current player must try to secretly predict the result of the other players' subsequent open discussion and consensus view. No-one is penalised for an inability to reach consensus, the game encourages one option picked at random perhaps by flipping a coin, to keep the game moving. If the current player predicted correctly, they get a bonus turn.&#10;&#10;Typical questions include &quot;Would you rather ... On senior prom night, have to take your parent -OR- your 12 year old sibling?&quot;&#10;&#10;Every so often players get the opportunity to take a difficult challenge with the winner being the first person to complete their third challenge.&#10;&#10;";1998;4.36561;1.1957;3;8;20;12;Party Game
678;X-it!;"X-it! is simple mix of &quot;Spite and Malice&quot; (aka Skip-Bo) and solitaire mechanics. There are two decks which each have four suits with 20 cards in each suit. One deck is used to establish a large tableau on a circular gameboard which has 26 card slots around the circumference and four slots forming a central &quot;X&quot;.  The second deck also contains 8 wild cards. Seven cards are dealt to each player from this second deck. The goal is to lay off all the cards in your hand onto one or more of the four &quot;X&quot; cards. The twist is you must be able to dump your entire hand on a single turn. In lieu of this option, a player must try to play a card onto one of the 26 ring cards. Ring and &quot;X&quot; cards must first be &quot;opened&quot; by playing the exact same card on it. After this, cards of any suit may be played on open cards in runs of ascending or descending order. At the end of a turn, a player must play a card even if he was able to discard. If a player puts a card into a run that could have been used to open a card, he loses a turn and must take a penalty card from the player who catches him in the act.&#10;&#10;";1997;4.04883;2.0;2;6;20;12;Card Game

Each character has its own strength and guile values. Players can move around the outer desert spaces to harvest monetary units of spice or can move around the inner castle spaces to build up strength. Players can use spice to buy random equipment cards, spice harvesters, or extra boosts of guile when under attack. Players can also invest in the craps-like commodity markets that pay off on certain dice rolls. The artwork is slick, the rules are relatively simple compared to AH's version, and games go fairly quickly since all fights are to the death.&#10;&#10;";1984;5.74106;2.16;2;4;90;10;Movies / TV / Radio theme, Novel-based, Science Fiction

As each piece moves, it literally leaves a paper trail of cardboard chits showing its progress through the game. A piece can be captured at any point on its timeline by landing on a square containing a chit, and any actions taken since then by that piece are reversed. In this way a piece can capture an opposing piece 'earlier' than when that piece captured a friendly piece, thereby returning the friendly piece to the board.

685;Marrakesh;"Marrakesh was designed by Prince Joli Kansil of Hawaii, the same designer as Bridgette, the two-handed bridge game. Marrakesh is an odd amalgam of backgammon and cardplay which works remarkably well. Each player sets up six pieces on their board based on the roll of six dice. Each player is dealt a hand of six cards from a special deck, and then try to collect two card tricks, using the card values to bear off the pieces. Points are awarded for bearing off pieces in various combinations, such as 2 on each of three turns, or the legendary Marrakesh itself, when all six pieces are borne off on the same turn. Defensive points are earned for keeping the opponent from removing many pieces from their board. Play continues for 12 rounds, which goes by quickly.

Each partnership takes the part of either the Sun or Moon cult, and plays cards only of its designated suit. An interesting mechanic is that since the cards are dealt randomly, it is often necessary and even prudent to have an opponent play a card for you. The object of the game is to collect souls (of either cult) and temples of your own suit (which serve as a multiplier). Rounds move quickly, and points can add up dramatically.

The game is strategic in scale, and units are generic strength points representing Taiping rebels, Manchu banner troops, provincial army troops, bandits and Mongolian cavalry.  The game map represents Manchu China.&#10;&#10;The Taiping player starts at an advantage in troops and leaders and seeks to conquer enough of the country to force a collapse of the Manchu government.  The Manchu player seeks to survive the Taiping onslaught, and gains strength as the provincial forces are brought to bear.  However, over-reliance on provincial forces will cause a reduction of Imperial authority, and that in itself may cause the game to be lost.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a map, playing counters, rules and numerous charts.&#10;&#10;A remake The Dragon and The Cross was published in 2018.&#10;&#10;";1988;6.03871;2.5;2;2;240;12;Post-Napoleonic, Wargame
689;Dubble Kross;"Dubble Kross uses a regurlar deck of cards, two six-sided dice, 11 plastic pegs and a house-shaped pegboard. Cards 2 through Queen each have a track on the board. Kings, aces and jokers are used as special action cards. After dealing out all the cards, four dice rolls determine the four penalty numbers. Any one who has the corresponding cards in their hands must pay to the kitty. In phase two, each player rolls the dice and either advances the corresponding peg on the board or pays more to the pot if the a penalty number is rolled. Like Parker Bros. &quot;Can't Stop&quot;, the length of each track is proportional to the probability of the roll. Therefore, the  &quot;7&quot; peg must travel the greatest distance while the &quot;2&quot; and &quot;12&quot; (Queen) pegs need only travel three spaces to win. When a peg crosses the finish line unchallenged, each corresponding card in players' hands are worth a quarter of the pot.&#10;&#10;";1991;8.0;0.0;3;10;120;0;Card Game, Dice

Each player has a different clue, and although clues are passed around, only one player receives three of the total five clues. From the actions of the other players (caravan leaders), the clues have to be guessed and camels have to be relocated, in order to save all the goods from the thieves.&#10;&#10;The next morning, the caravan continues its way towards Timbuktu, and players are challenged with different clues again.

One player acts as game master, revealing the maze-like dungeon piecemeal as the players wander.  Up to four other players take on a character (wizard, elf, dwarf, or barbarian) and venture forth into dungeons on fantasy quests. This game was made in cooperation with Games Workshop Ltd. who designed the miniatures and helped in many of the production details including background world and art in the rule book and scenario book. The HeroQuest series consists of the main game and a number of expansions.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a grid representing the interior of a dungeon or castle, with walls segmenting the grid into rooms and corridors. One player assumes the role of the evil wizard character (Zargon/Morcar), and uses a map taken from the game's quest book to determine how the quest is to be played. The map details the placement of monsters, artifacts, and doors, as well as the overall quest the other players are embarking upon. During a Hero's turn, the player can move before or after performing one of the following actions: attack, cast a spell, search for traps and secret doors, search for treasure.&#10;&#10;The game ends when every player has either returned to the spiral staircase, exited by a door, or been killed by the evil wizard. If the objective of the quest has not been accomplished then the evil wizard character wins. Items collected during the quest may be kept for future quests. The quests usually form part of a longer story, especially the quests which are part of the expansion packs.&#10;&#10;Additional material, which is generally missed since it is not technically an expansion, was published in the HeroQuest: Adventure Design Kit which did feature one more Heroquest adventure: A Plague of Zombies.&#10;&#10;";1989;7.2129;2.1335;2;5;90;14;Adventure, Exploration, Fantasy, Fighting, Miniatures

720;Fast Food Franchise;"Players compete with each other to start fast food corporations, open new markets, launch advertising campaigns, and build nationwide chains of restaurants.  The winner is the first player to make a million dollars, or be the only player left in the game if all other players go bankrupt.&#10;&#10;From Wikipedia:&#10;Initially, the game looks like Monopoly. There is a board, with spaces around the edges. Some of these spaces can be controlled. Each time you land on a space controlled by an opponent, you pay them money.&#10;&#10;The inside of the board is an abstracted map of the United States. There are no fixed &quot;color groups;&quot; rather, your controlled outer spaces (&quot;Markets&quot;) are the major cities of the USA, and you need to use the inner map to connect these markets.&#10;&#10;Connected markets act like multiple colors in a color group. However, the expansion in the middle map is far more strategic than random.&#10;&#10;Where Monopoly is a game about trading property, Fast Food Franchise is a game of controlling the inner map.&#10;&#10;";1992;6.34108;2.1389;2;5;180;12;Economic

You play against each other alternating as an attacker and a defender.  The attacker can select either a Fate or an Action card from draw piles.  Action cards map out actual plays with 2-6 passes and a shot on goal.  Each Action card has a number on it 5v3 or 3v3.  These numbers tell you how many dice you will be rolling against each other for each pass.  The attacker is always the first number.  If the attacker rolls a higher number it completes the pass and you go on to the next pass, if the defender rolls a higher number than the attacker the pass was not complete and the action card gets discarded and now the defender draws a Fate or Action card and becomes the attacker.  If the attacker completes all of his passes and is now at the last line on the card this is the shot on goal.  For the shot on goal the attacker and the defender only roll one die a piece to simulate the shooter and the goalkeeper.&#10;&#10;Fate cards are things that can happen during a game like red card, injuries, goalkeeper saves.  Fate cards can be used at any time to help you in your game.  The game is complete when all the action cards have been used.

745;War of Resistance;"Box description:&#10;War of Resistance is a detailed, operational level game which chronicles the second Sino-Japanese Conflict starting on July 7, 1937. Often touted as the true beginning of World War II, this 8 year war is the culmination of a decade of aggressive Japanese policy in northern and central China. The game covers the conflict through Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.&#10;The Chinese theatre is neither trivial nor inconsequential to the progress and outcome of World War II on a global scale. Over one million soldiers on each side perished. It is estimated that another 7.5 million Chinese civilians died. Over 40 million Chinese were left homeless. The vast majority of Japanese ground combat and support soldiers were engaged in China, preventing their use against the western Allies in the Pacific. America's material dominance may have been the decisive factor contributing to the Japanese demise, but Japan was already doomed to failure in the Chinese quagmire. This is essential to the greater understanding of the war in the Pacific.&#10;Western nations tend to ignore and forget the Chinese contribution to the war effort. It is an indication of western arrogance that World War II is considered to have started on September 1, 1939 and not July 7, 1937. The Chinese war effort was far from stellar, but it was enormous. The immensity of the conflict sapped the Japanese war machine to exhaustion.&#10;War of Resistance is a two-player game, with one player representing the military high command of the Japanese forces and their puppet allies, and the other the fractured Chinese military forces. The Japanese player must force the collapse of the Chinese national will to resist. The Chinese player must cling to survival until the entry of the western nations into the Pacific war ensures ultimate victory over the Japanese invaders. Both sides maneuver their forces and conduct combat in an attempt to achieve these goals.&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;&#10;    One rules booklet.&#10;    Two Orders of Battle booklets.

What gives Trax its strategic depth is the forced play rule which allows (or even requires) multiple tiles to be played in a turn.&#10;&#10;";1980;6.48153;2.1273;2;2;10;8;Abstract Strategy

With these new skills came seniority, prestige, and high standing amongst their peers.&#10;&#10;In the game, the townsfolk and their seniority are represented by numbered tiles. Keytown is played over four rounds. Each round represents a generation in the lives of the townsfolk, during which the townsfolk may work or study in the resource locations, gain new skills in the church, council, or market, or start a family in a cottage.

But the first boat is a sinking wreck whilst the fourth boat is a modern speedboat, so the seven must time their run down the path to be last, not first.

The object of the game is still basically the same (collect a full set), but you can either collect figures or colors.  In addition, each hand is played with a variable time limit, as the dealer gets to play either a quick hand (he thinks he can get the Remmi quickly), or a longer hand.  Either way, the first set (Remmi) gets the most points, with those that follow getting less or none.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.63273;1.0;4;9;30;8;Party Game, Real-time

The Big Battle queen in addition to the powers of the ordinary chess queen can also jump over an immediately adjacent piece. The pawns (called soldiers in Big Battle) can move one two or threes squares; not just on their first moves but for any move. It makes for a pretty sharp end game.

782;Win, Place & Show;"A race meeting consisting of 6 races, each with 6 horses of varying power and characteristics.  Board shows an oval track of six lanes, straightforward in straights but graduated on the curves.  Although dice play a part in the game there is plenty of room for skillful maneuvering in the course of each race, which can be from 5 furlongs to 1 1/4 miles.  An important part of the game is provided by certain marked squares: if you can get your horse to stop on one of these it can overtake one horse ahead of it in the same line, which can be vital considering that only two swerves are permitted in each turn (only one if the jockey is an apprentice).  Every horse has a distinctive racing pattern (slow or fast starter, stayer or fader etc.) represented by a set of numbers, one for each turn.  These numbers are added to a single dice throw (common to all the horses), so that the speed of each race can vary substantially.  There are many other interesting factors too numerous to describe in a short review.  Odds on each horse are pre-set and depend largely on the number patterns described above.&#10;&#10;Originally released as part of the 3M Sports Games line.&#10;&#10;";1966;6.73827;2.0842;3;6;120;8;Animals, Racing, Sports

Victory is determined on two levels, political and military, with each being given equal weightage.&#10;&#10;Units protrayed are mainly divisions, with special brigades, such as airmobile units, spec-ops units and helicopter units being represented.  The game map covers the entire island of Formosa (also known as Taiwan).  Map scale is 10km per hexagon.&#10;&#10;";2000;6.22105;4.3333;2;2;120;12;Wargame
804;Thunder Road;"Thunder Road is Milton Bradley's answer to Mad Max. You rocket your team (three cars and a helicopter) down a stretch of post-apocalyptic highway and try to either wipe out the other teams or outdistance them and leave them in the dust. Each turn consists of a dice roll to determine car movement and a combat phase where you try to shoot or ram your opponents. The gameboard consists of two pieces of highway and when the lead car exits the front piece of highway, the back piece is placed in front (after dumping all the wrecks and slowpokes off of it) thus creating a never-ending gameboard.&#10;&#10;";1986;6.64514;1.3571;2;4;45;10;Fighting, Racing, Science Fiction
806;West Riding;"West Riding is a train game about building new lines in a section of the UK during the Industrial Revolution. It is the first entry in the Riding Series, all published by Winsome Games.&#10;&#10;In West Riding there are two types of shares, Basic and Grouping. The primary strategy of the game revolves around these, as Basic Shares can be traded in for Grouping ones at a 2:1 rate, and the grouping shares slowly gain in value as the game progresses. The mechanics of portraying the theme do result in some extra bookkeeping as the game's eight railroads' values need to be reassessed with each turn.&#10;&#10;";2000;6.45897;3.5;3;6;180;12;Trains

816;2038: Tycoons of the Asteroid Belt;"2038 is a space mining adaptation of the 18xx series of games.  First, you have the ever important stock trading rounds followed by operating rounds where you try to deliver commodities mined from the asteroid belt.&#10;&#10;Instead of laying track, the players explore the asteroid belt and lay claims to various mining resources. During operation rounds, ships move from mine to mine limited only by their fuel and the players' refueling stations. Operation is thus more flexible than in most 18xx games, and the randomly generated map greatly increases replay value.&#10;&#10;";1995;7.10435;4.0196;3;6;360;14;Economic, Science Fiction, Space Exploration, Trains, Transportation
820;Axiom;"Axiom is a two player strategy game that is played in three dimensions.  The board is made up of twelve cubes, six of each color. Each player has two pawns which snap into the indentations on the cubes.  The object is to capture one of the other player's pawns.  On a turn, a player can move one of their pawns over the surfaces of the cubes, or move one of their cubes to change the playing surface.&#10;&#10;At Essen 2008, a new version was released with a new physical design: smooth curved pawns, held into the indentations by magnets.&#10;&#10;";1988;6.94534;2.875;2;2;15;9;Abstract Strategy
822;Carcassonne;"Carcassonne is a tile placement game in which the players draw and place a tile with a piece of southern French landscape represented on it. The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, et cetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of their meeples in one of the areas on it: in the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, in the cloister as a monk, or in the field as a farmer. When that area is complete that meeple scores points for its owner.&#10;&#10;During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&quot; or &quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, thus making it a harder for them to complete it and score points?&quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.&#10;&#10;First game in the Carcassonne series.&#10;&#10;";2000;7.41266;1.8886;2;5;45;7;Medieval, Territory Building

826;Cartagena;"Cartagena takes as its theme the famous 1672 pirate-led jailbreak from the fortress of Cartagena. Each player has a group of six pirates, and you want to be the first to have all six escape through the tortuous underground passage that connects the fortress to the port, where a sloop is waiting for them.&#10;&#10;To move a pirate, you need to play a card from your hand. Each card bears one of six symbols (dagger, pirate hat, etc.), and when you play a card, you move one of your pirates forward to the next matching symbol in the tunnel, leapfrogging over matching symbols where another pirate already stands. The only way to get more cards, however, is to move backwards; more specifically, you move one of your pirates backwards to the first space that holds one or two pirates, drawing one or two cards after doing so. Each turn, you take 1-3 actions, whether moving forward or backward or both.&#10;&#10;When you move a pirate to the end of the track, it jumps on the sloop where it must await the other pirates in its crew. With every step toward victory, though, you have fewer and fewer pirates to move each turn, possibly locking you in to actions you don't want, so be sure to plan ahead and not leave yourself empty-handed!&#10;&#10;";2000;6.68076;1.5987;2;5;45;8;Nautical, Pirates
828;Wizards;"This is Avalon Hill's game of Fantasy Adventure.&#10;&#10;This game uses hexagonal modular map sections, providing a different board layout for each game.&#10;&#10;Map tile-sections are placed on a blank mapboard to make up the arrangement of the Enchanted Islands for that game.&#10;&#10;Most of the game consists of performing various mini-quests by moving around the 18 islands to pick up marker counters for the specific quest.&#10;&#10;Each quest adds to the 10 quest per fortnight (14 days) requirement. Failure to reach this total of quests among all players causes one of the 18 islands to be flipped over and taken out of the game.&#10;&#10;In this way the players are competing mainly versus the game system.&#10;&#10;Endgame consists of players racing against each other to be first to collect 6 Gem Fragments and take them to the High Druid.&#10;&#10;";1982;6.39727;2.9615;1;6;240;12;Adventure, Fantasy

834;Chronology;"Chronology is a card game of all time. More specifically, during the game each player builds a timeline of cards, with each card listing an historical event and the year in which it occurred.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, players are dealt two cards, which are then placed face up in chronological order. On their turn, a player is read an event from a new card; the player must then indicate the position on their own timeline where the card should be placed. If they're correct, they take possession of the card and inserts it in their line; if not, the next player gets a crack at it, and so on. The first player with ten cards wins.&#10;&#10;Some versions of Chronology have players compete to create a timeline of only five cards.&#10;&#10;";1996;6.51525;1.3973;2;8;30;12;Card Game, Educational, Party Game, Trivia

840;Corsairs;"Corsairs is essentially a card game where players attempt to assemble the correct combination of provisions in order to be able to board galleys, whilst possessing a strong enough crew in order to board the ship and fend off their opponents potential counterattacks. The game comes with 30 galleys tiles in five different colors. Four of these galleys are placed face-up on the table and are ripe for the taking. Each galley indicates the combination of provisions which must be played before a player can attempt to board it. In addition, each galley indicates the victory points it is worth, as well as the 'boarding' strength, which must be met or exceeded for it to fall prey to the pirates.&#10;&#10;Players are each dealt an initial hand of six cards, most of which depict one of six different types of provisions (water, bread, meat, rum, bananas or beans). In addition, several cards depict corsairs (pirates) with values ranging from 2 - 4.&#10;&#10;On their turn, players must play 3 cards. They may play them:&#10;&#10;a) beside a galley to begin amassing provision cards so as to eventually match the provision requirements indicated on the galley. &#10;b) to the discard pile, replacing them with cards chosen from rummaging through the discard pile&#10;c) 'fire a broadside' by playing any card to the discard pile and rolling dice. He may then steal matching provisions placed by the galley by other players.&#10;&#10;Once a player assembles all of the necessary provisions, he can attempt to board the ship. He needs to have enough corsairs, to add to the roll of two dice to beat the boarding value of the galley. Other players may also attempt to board the galley at the same time, and the one with the highest boarding value wins it. The others lose all the cards played next to the galley. A new galley is then made available.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player with most VP from galleys boarded.&#10;&#10;(precis from the review by gschloesser)&#10;&#10;";2000;6.05788;1.6667;2;4;60;10;Card Game, Fighting, Nautical, Pirates
844;Mausoleum;"In this Edward-Gorey-inspired card game, players invite their wealthy relatives to parties where they meet with horrible accidents, and their inheritances are used to build lavish tombs, with the end goal being to build the largest Mausoleum. Cards represent your various relatives (Petulant Brats, Eccentric Widows, Bumbling Gardeners, Clever Nephews, etc.), the horrible accidents that befall them (Lost in the Hedge Maze, Fallen Down the Well, Mildly Suspicious Suicide, etc.), various graves, and &quot;incidents&quot; which have various affects, like causing an heir from an opponent's party to go &quot;On Holiday&quot; before (s)he could be done in, or causing an opponent's dead relatives to be &quot;Misplaced&quot;, and thus negating their value.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://studiohunty.com/sg/mausoleum/info.html&#10;&#10;";2000;4.6117;1.3636;3;5;20;12;Card Game, Humor
848;Tip Tap;"In TohuWabohu, a.k.a. Tip Tap, players must race to finger the right items on the table &mdash; but winning an item isn't good enough as you need to protect it from being stolen while still hunting for more.&#10;&#10;In more detail, you set up the game by placing all of the multi-colored and strangely shaped cardboard bits on the table. Each round, one player is the director and takes charge of flipping over a card that depicts one or more of these bits. Everyone races to place a finger on the depicted items first, and once you've placed a finger on an item, you can't move it again. Once all the depicted items are found (assuming they were correctly figured), the fingerers place those items in front of themselves, then the director flips another card. If a card shows an item previously claimed, the owner of that item must secure it with a finger; if they don't, any opponent who touches it first will steal it away.&#10;&#10;If a player has seven or eight bits in front of them, then the round ends and everyone scores one point for each item that they collected. After playing as many rounds as the number of players, the game ends and whoever has scored the most points wins.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.79228;1.0;3;6;45;7;Party Game, Real-time

The object of the game is to build up the New York skyline, consisting of twelve numbered sections.    Each section has four pieces, one in each colour - 48 tiles in all.   Each player has a colour for which they will score.   You start with a hand of six tiles, a &ldquo;draw pool&rdquo; of six face-up, and the rest face-down.   On your turn; you lay a tile, you replace from the draw pool, you replenish the draw pool.   The game continues until all the tiles are laid; though you can stop laying tiles if you want (to &ldquo;protect&rdquo; some of your own colours on show), but once you&rsquo;ve stopped, that&rsquo;s it, and other players can still lay theirs.   At the end, you score for any face-up tile of your colour, with bonuses for getting tiles adjacent.&#10;&#10;";1989;5.82528;1.2857;2;4;30;8;City Building

Players then take time to sort out their hand as they want to play it. When everybody has fixed their hand, the first trick is lead. You may only play a card from either END of your hand, you may NOT re-order your hand or choose from the middle. Score the tricks you won. Each card with a Blind Hen has some eggs on it, the eggs count against you - minus one point each. But if a trick has more than one Blind Hen in it, you total the Hens and multiply with the total eggs to give the score for that trick.&#10;&#10;";1997;5.31882;1.125;3;6;20;8;Card Game
860;Scotland the Brave;"from Consimworld:&#10;&#10;The Situation&#10;There is no greater hero in Scottish history than William Wallace. In 1297 he began what grew into the Scottish Rebellion. The death of his wife at the hands of the English launched Wallace on a quest to expel them from Scotland. Unlike other leaders in the rebellion, Wallace never betrayed his country, his comrades or his cause.&#10;&#10;The Game&#10;SCOTLAND THE BRAVE is based on the opening of the Scottish War for Independence. Beginning with the revolt of a minor land owner named William Wallace in 1297, it culminated in the victory of Robert the Bruce in 1315 at Bannockburn. SCOTLAND THE BRAVE simulates the first two years of the conflict in which William Wallace was the dominant figure. Players take the place of either William Wallace or King Edward of England as each attempts to gain the assistance of Scottish nobles and control of southern Scotland.&#10;&#10;SCOTLAND THE BRAVE originally appeared in issue no. 49 of Shadis Magazine. This Avalanche Press Edition features different components, complete with mounted mapsheet, and new rules. This is a fast-playing game which can be learned and played in a single sitting. Battle is a means to an end, with control of the towns the key to winning. Introducing randomness in the form of Strategy Markers adds a bit of spice.

864;Mage Knight;"WizKids' first game, Mage Knight cleverly applies the CCG concept to miniatures; a &quot;Starter Pack&quot; contains 10 random pre-painted, plastic miniatures, while &quot;Booster Packs&quot; contain 5. Figures' stats are kept track of via dials on their bases, which change depending on how much damage they've taken.&#10;&#10;As in most miniatures games, players each create an army with the same number of points (with each miniature having a different point value), then take turns moving and attacking until all of the opponent's forces are dead or captured, the opponent withdraws, or your pre-determined time limit expires.&#10;&#10;The same figures could be used in two other games:&#10;&#10;    Mage Knight Conquest&#10;    Mage Knight Dungeons&#10;&#10;&#10;Mage Knight 2.0&#10;&#10;Mage Knight 2.0 changed many rules which overhauled or expanded, they introduced new strategic possibilities to the game, including capabilities to customize Unique warriors and battles via styrene cards called Items, Domains, and Constructed Terrain.&#10;&#10;Later expansions introduced more options via Spellbooks, Spells, and Adventuring Companies.&#10;&#10;It was eventually counted as a new game since the old figures were ruled obsolete for all tournaments that utilized the Mage Knight 2.0 format.&#10;&#10;The two &quot;versions&quot; can be distinguished by their logos; the original Mage Knight sets feature a straight short sword through the logo while &quot;2.0&quot; and its subsequent expansions have a curved scimitar.&#10;&#10;";2000;6.21952;2.382;2;4;60;10;Collectible Components, Fantasy, Miniatures, Wargame

The full-color cards allow the use of pikes, swords, war bands, elephants, heavy cavalry, foot skirmishers, light horse, siege towers, artillery, and galleys. Special cards allow you to develop better military leaders, diplomats, traders, and engineers. However, winning the game is not just about having the largest empire.

A timer is used to determine how much time one has to construct the required shape. Once you complete the required shape you turn the timer on its side. Others then have the remaining time to solve the puzzle or can work as a group to solve and get the points for solving.&#10;&#10;Shuffle the 36 task cards and 8 event cards together and placed them in the unsolved tasks area.  Each player takes a set of stones/playing pieces.  Players place their marker on the beginning of the scoring track.

876;Tennis Masters;"Goldsieber attempts to capture the feel of tennis in this oddball dexterity game.  Each player has a  still tennis player figure which is used to volley the ball back and forth across the net.  Under each player, and under the translucent surface of the board is the movement paddle for that player, which dictates how far the playing figure could move for the subsequent turn.  The game field is set up just like a tennis court, with the requisite lines and a net, and the players volley a soft tufted &quot;tennis ball&quot;.  One player serves the ball, and if it lands within the fair territory, the receiving player checks to see if it fell within their movement paddle space.  That player then moves the center of their paddle under the ball and uses their figure to return the ball, and so on until one player scores by their opponent knocking the ball out of play, or by playing the ball in a space where their opponent cannot reach it within their movement zone.  All of the ball volleying is performed by tensing back the racket of the playing figure, and then releasing it to launch the ball across the net.  Scoring is handled just like regular tennis scoring.&#10;&#10;";2000;5.67553;1.5;2;2;40;8;Action / Dexterity, Sports

Hunt Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid! Rich rewards await those brave and daring enough. Just don't let them slip away...&#10;&#10;From the Publisher:&#10;In Wyatt Earp, the players are bounty hunters who work cooperatively and competitively to try to capture the most notorious outlaws of the old west. They do this by collecting and playing sets of cards for the various outlaws. When a player plays a set, he both adds to the reward and improves his chances for collecting the reward for that outlaw. At the end of each hand, players collect money for the outlaws that they helped in capturing. After several hands, the player who has collected the most money in rewards is the winner!&#10;&#10;While not officially included, Wyatt Earp is often considered part of the Mystery Rummy series.&#10;&#10;This game is #1 in the Alea small box series.&#10;&#10;";2001;6.83531;1.8422;2;4;45;8;American West, Card Game
882;Derby;"Players represent bettors at a horse track. The state of the betting is handled via a set of non-intersecting bet cards which players may draft. Movement of the horses is controlled by a combination of cards, one of which indicates which horses may move, the other which indicates how fast. Players must consider the probable goals of their opponents as well as what opportunities they may provide to the player on the left.&#10;&#10;";2000;6.06848;1.5;3;5;60;0;Bluffing, Racing, Sports
884;Way Out West;"In this western themed game, players are looking to drive cattle across the west, establishing towns.  If you don't like the way something is going, you can fight other players for control with your cowboys.  You can rob the bank, rustle cattle, and shoot those pesky farmers!&#10;&#10;Gameplay:  To Start each player receives a set of colored player counters, matching turn order token, and two black action tokens and either $20 or $25 depending on number of players.  The dice are rolled to determine the start player. Each player in turn order will place one of their cowboy counters in a town box of any of the 5 towns on the map until each player has placed 3 cowboys.&#10;&#10;Each turn the players will bid for turn order, take actions and move the turn marker one space.  To bid for turn order each player places an amount of money under their turn order token in current player order.  Players may either raise or drop out.  If a player drops out all money bid so far is paid to the bank and their turn order token is placed in the furthest available spot from start player space on the turn order track.  This continues until one player remains and becomes the start player for the round.&#10;&#10;During the action phase each player will take 1 action in turn order.  After everyone has taken a turn they repeat the procedure.  The actions available are limited in number so turn order is important in doing what a player wishes to do.  Actions available are: Buy Cattle in a town containing their cowboy(s), Purchase more Cowboys, Move Cowboys to different towns, Move Cattle from one town to another, Purchase Buildings or Transport counters in a town, Take a Farmer(reduces income and victory points from Cattle in the town they are placed), or Gunfight.&#10;&#10;There are six different building and transport counters: StageCoach (these earn $1 per cowboy when cowboys are placed in or moved from the town containing the player's StageCoach), Train (this doubles the income gained from all players Cattle in the same town and doubles victory points gained from Cattle at game end),  Bank (earns its owner $2 for each building or transport counter in the same town), Store (earns the owner $1 for each Cattle counter belonging to other players in the town and $2 per Farmer counter in town),  Hotel (earns $1 for each cowboy belonging to other players in same town), Jail (the sheriff in the Jail acts as an extra cowboy controlled by owner that can be added to Gunfights). Cattle and Farmers also earn money for players during an income round.  Each Cattle counter earns its owner $2 UNLESS the town also contains a Farmer (it only earns $1 if this is the case).  Oh, the Farmer and Cowmen can't be friends.&#10;&#10;Gunfights can be started to take over another players Building or Tranport counter, rustle Cattle, rob a Bank or remove a Farmer or Jail.  The player choosing the Gunfight selects the target of the attack.  All Cowboys belonging to each player in the town will be involved.  The remaining player's Cowboys in the town are not involved. However; the owner of the Jail can choose to help themselves, if they are attacking, or they can add the Sheriff to the defender if wished.  Farmers that are attacked defend as a single cowboy.  Banks and Trains both have an intrinsic 1 Cowboy defense in addition to those in town of owner's color.  The player with the fewest Cowboys fires first and immediately removes casualties.  Each 5 or 6 rolled kills a Cowboy.  If the number of Cowboys is tied then firing is simultaneous.  A player may retreat instead of firing by moving each cowboy involved to a different town (only 1 per town) and loses the engagement.  If the attacker wins they take control of the target of the attack and may replace the counter (up to 2 counters if rustling Cattle) with one of their color (except for Banks, Farmers and Jails).  A Jail or Farmer is removed from play and a Bank is robbed.  The successful robber rolls 3 die 6 and takes that amount of money from the owner of the Bank (the Bank remains under owner's control).  If the owner of the Bank cannot pay the full amount (then pays all they have to the robber and the Bank is removed).  Each time a player wins a Gunfight they take a Wanted Counter.  If none remain they take it from another player their of choice.&#10;&#10;Victory:  After taking turns 3,6,9 and 12 income is paid to players as delineated above.  The game ends after round 12.  Victory points are awarded for each Building or Transport counter (1 point per size of town).  So a building in a Town with 4 Building or Transport Counters including itself is worth 4 points to the owning player.  Each Cattle Counter is worth one victory point for the owner.  If a train is in the town each Cattle Counter is worth 2 points.  If a Farmer is in the town Cattle are worth 1 victory point less.  To illustrate, if a Farmer is in same town Cattle counters are worthless unless a Train is also present in the town.  In this case, they would be worth 1 point each.  The player with the most Building/Transport counters and Cattle in a town is considered to control the town and scores bonus points equal to the size of the town (Cattle do not affect town size but do affect control).  The Player with most money gains 5 victory points (2 each in case of a tie).  The Player with the most Wanted counters scores 4 victory points.  The player with most Points wins.&#10;&#10;";2000;6.13047;2.6203;3;5;120;12;American West

The board has a scoring track and there is an element of swindling your opponents.&#10;&#10;From MNG-AJM Games Catalog 2005:  Players purchase shops and then enhance them and buy more shops as the game goes on.  The board shows an overhead view of a city centre around which customers wander - some normal, some big spenders and one thief. A special die is used to let you move a customer - the idea being to direct the spenders to your shops and away from those of opponents while making sure the thief stays away from your shops and goes to as many opponents' shops as possible.&#10;&#10;The game was redeveloped and published as The Market of Alturien, the first game in the Alturien series.&#10;&#10;";1988;5.59876;1.625;2;6;30;8;Economic

904;Nightmare Productions;"Reiner Knizia's auction game about producing movies. In four rounds, players bid on chips representing genuine directors, actors, camera, effects, music, guest stars and agents (or in Nightmare Productions edition: creatures, locations, directors, musical conductors, cameos, and contractors). These all get placed on players' film-strips to complete the movie production. So one movie might need 2 actors (in editions prior to Nightmare Productions), but no music or effects and so on. As films are completed, the points value is marked and another film-strip taken. There are two parties (in Nightmare Productions edition: horror cons) each round where players get to pick from offers without paying anything. There are bonus points for first films completed and best films, best directors (in Nightmare Productions edition: best creatures), even worst film.&#10;&#10;The auction is a basic rising offer with passing until one winning bid remains. Players pay into the pot with contracts (in Nightmare Productions edition: money), and the rest of the players share the pot each turn. So it's a closed economy with players trying to time to bid on what they really need to complete films.&#10;&#10;See Movie Comparison - Traumfabrik for listings of movies and actors in each version prior to Nightmare Productions edition.&#10;&#10;Note: There have been many editions of the game under varying names.

911;Empires of the Middle Ages;"This classic SPI game from 1980 covers the economic and political landscape of Medieval Europe from 771 to 1467 on an area map.  Several scenarios allow players to do anything from a solitaire game during the Charlemagne's reign to the &quot;Grand Scenario&quot; that covers historical trends throughout the period.&#10;&#10;Decision Games published a second edition in 2004, with a differently styled map.  It added optional expansion rules &amp; counters for Armies, Fleets, and Civilization Markers, along with additional Event Cards -- raising their number from 56 to 164.&#10;&#10;At the start of each player's Round, Event Cards are drawn which change the strategic situation (such as Plague or Bounty) or benefit a player in various ways.  The descriptions of the Events contain a great deal of historical information, adding much interest to the game.&#10;&#10;Each player may attempt to perform up to five &quot;Endeavors&quot; per 25-year long Turn.&#10;&#10;There are six types of Endeavors:  Conquest, Pillage, Diplomacy, Defense, Fortification (including building Armies/Fleets) and Ruling. Additionally, moving Armies/Fleets and Taxation may always be performed.&#10;&#10;Endeavor resolution is diceless; instead &quot;Year Cards&quot; which show an array of results for each type of Endeavor are drawn.  The card might also require a Leader Stature Check, which can change the player's Combat, Administration, and Diplomacy ratings.&#10;&#10;Endeavor resolution is affected by the appropriate Leader rating, and the involved areas' language, religion, population, and Social State (which changes frequently).  Poor performance can lead to Unrest or Rebellion in an Area.&#10;&#10;An area's Social State value rises and falls as a result of Events and Endeavors, and improving the Social State of your empire is an important object of play.&#10;&#10;Optional rules add non-player Raiders and Magnates.&#10;&#10;The Sword And The Stars is a galactic empire game based on the Empires Of The Middle Age game system.&#10;&#10;";1980;7.173;3.5439;1;6;360;14;Civilization, Economic, Medieval, Political, Wargame

915;Mystery of the Abbey;"Mystery of the Abbey is a whodunit deduction game in the spirit of Clue. A monk has been murdered in a medieval French Abbey. Players maneuver their way through the Abbey examining clues and questioning each other to find out who is the culprit.&#10;&#10;Monks are of three orders, fat-thin, bald-hatted, bearded-clean shaven. One monk card is hidden, and the rest of the cards are distributed.  Turns consist of moving up to two spaces, and then asking a question of any other monks who are present there. (For instance, &quot;how many fat monks do you have?&quot;.) Players may either take a &quot;vow of silence&quot; or answer truthfully; they then in turn get to ask the accuser a question.  &quot;Mass&quot; occurs every four turns: all players go back to the Sanctuary, an event card is read, and they then pass an ever growing number of cards to their left neighbor. Various rooms have special events or cards associated with them, e.g. in a Cell you get to pick a card from a neighbor, in the Cryptorum you get to pick up a card to take an extra turn later. Unlike Clue you don't automatically win by making a correct Accusation: you get 4 points for getting it right, but you also get 2 points for each correct Declaration of a single trait, and lose points for incorrect declarations and accusations. So, e.g. a person could correctly Declare the culprit but lose the game.  Unique Events cards add randomness to each play, and the game begs for House rules to limit the questions.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.53652;2.2031;3;6;90;8;Deduction, Medieval, Murder / Mystery, Religious

923;Breakaway Rider;"Simple card game of cycle racing. Players fight to hold the yellow jersey when the race ends.&#10;&#10;Players are dealt 6 cards and draw a 7th before playing a pace card, and any additional modifiers. There are 84 pace cards numbered between 39 and 50, Spurts (which add 2 to your pace), Headwind (which subtract -2 from your pace) and Mountains (which ensure that no one can take the lead from the current player).&#10;&#10;One player starts as the race leader with a yellow token, and plays a speed card. Successive players must match the leader's pace to stay in the Peleton (the race pack), and each enjoys a +2 to their pace card simulating the benefit of decreased wind resistance.  If a player falls more than 2 behind the pack, than they draw chips (representing minutes) equal to the difference from their card and the race pace.  If a player starts his turn not in the Peleton, than he does not get the +2 slipstream bonus.&#10;&#10;If a player plays a card that is faster than the race leader, they either take the lead, or make up time until they catch the Peleton.  If they take the lead, they take the yellow token, and successive players must now match their tempo.&#10;&#10;You must play Headwinds when you draw them, and you can use Spurts as you like.  You play Mountain cards on yourself or the race leader, and they prevent anyone from passing the leader, and they also remove the 2 km slipstream bonus that other player otherwise enjoy.&#10;&#10;The race ends when the deck runs out.  The player holding the yellow token wins and scores a point, the other players lose points equal to the chips in front of them.&#10;&#10;Timing is everything if you plan to win.&#10;&#10;";1963;6.17223;1.2745;2;6;20;8;Card Game, Racing, Sports

There is also a Moderator who controls the flow of the game.&#10;&#10;The game alternates between night and day phases. At night, the Werewolves secretly choose a Villager to kill. Also, the Seer (if still alive) asks whether another player is a Werewolf or not. During the day, the Villager who was killed is revealed and is out of the game. The remaining Villagers then vote on the player they suspect is a Werewolf. That player reveals his/her role and is out of the game.&#10;&#10;Werewolves win when there are an equal number of Villagers and Werewolves. Villagers win when they have killed all Werewolves.

926;CATAN: Cities & Knights;"Adds several new aspects to Settlers of Catan but the two major ones are creating knights to protect the land from invading barbarians and building city improvements that confer benefits upon that city's owner. Adds tactical complexity to the game and game length.&#10;&#10;Belongs to the Catan Series.&#10;&#10;The game changes the base game in three main ways:&#10;&#10;First, there are 3 new commodities in the game, distinct from resources - paper, cloth, and coins, which can be acquired from Forest, Meadow, and Mountain spaces, respectively. Cities that would normally produce two of one of those resources instead produce 1 resource and 1 of the corresponding commodity. (To make commodities easier to obtain, each player starts the game with 1 city and 1 settlement on the board.) These commodities allow players to build city improvements that confer various advantages and eventually points.&#10;&#10;Second, the deck of development cards is replaced by three different decks, each corresponding to one of the commodities. Building city improvements gives players a chance to draw these cards with every roll of the dice. Building more improvements will increase these chances, but cards cannot be bought directly in any way. These cards are similar to the development cards in the base game, but with a wider range of effects. (Some cards are balanced better as well - the new Resource Monopoly card, for example, can take no more than 2 of the named resource from any one player.)&#10;&#10;Finally, players can also build knights on the island along their network of roads. These knights can be used to claim certain intersections and move the Robber (taking the place of Soldier cards), but are also used to defend the island from periodic barbarian attacks. If the island is successfully defended, the player(s) with the most knights are rewarded. If not, the player(s) with the fewest knights each have a city downgraded to a settlement.&#10;&#10;";1998;7.44983;2.8949;3;4;150;12;Expansion for Base-game, Medieval, Negotiation

A given planet may provide mineral resources and a number of settlement points -- the minerals can be collected for victory points, and if the planet is sufficiently terraformed, the settlement points go to whichever player sent the most settlers.&#10;&#10;";2000;5.08916;1.3571;2;4;30;8;Card Game, Real-time, Science Fiction
928;Gerüchteküche;"In &quot;Gossip Kitchen,&quot; players attempt to sort through the truth of the many rumors flying around. The deck consists of 10 types of rumors (each with its own symbol, such as a heart) with six cards each, for a total of 60 cards. To begin, one card is removed from play and all the remaining cards dealt out (distribution may be uneven). Players now seek to collect full sets of six rumor cards and deduce which rumor set is missing a card. Players ask another about their hand, e.g. &quot;Do you have three hearts?&quot; Players need only respond with an answer of &quot;more&quot; or &quot;less&quot; if the&#10;number asked is incorrect, and play passes clockwise from the asking player. If the number asked is correct, the questioner receives those cards and play passes to the&#10;answering player. Sets of six rumors collected are placed on the table and score three points. At any point, a player may guess which rumor group is missing, scoring 10 points &#10;for a correct guess and taking a penalty of 5 points for an incorrect guess.&#10;&#10;";2000;5.06333;1.1667;3;7;20;7;Card Game, Deduction
929;The Great Dalmuti;"A light card game where players gain status by going out first.&#10;&#10;The 80-card commercial deck contains cards ranked from 12 to 1, along with two Jesters. Each card bears a number, which is not only its rank, but also tells you how many of that card exist in the deck. In other words, there are twelve 12s, eleven 11s, four 4s and a single card ranked 1. The lower the number, the better the rank.&#10;&#10;The deck is dealt out to all players and the object is to get rid of your cards as fast as possible. The hand begins with one person playing one or more card to the center of the table. The cards played must all be of the same rank (although Jesters are wild, and may be played with any other cards). Each player in turn must now either play the same number of cards of a better rank, or pass. Play continues around the table until everyone has passed; at that point, the cards are cleared and whoever played the last set of cards leads the next round. After everyone has gone out, the players are ranked. For example, the person who first got rid of all his cards becomes The Great Dalmuti. Players change seat position to represent the new hierarchy and begin another round.  The Great Dalmuti is generally played for many rounds.&#10;&#10;It is a commercial version of the traditional playing card game President (based on the Chinese game Zheng Shang Yu), which has also been reimagined as:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Dilbert: Corporate Shuffle&#10;    Pyramid Card &#10;    Scum: The Food Chain Game &#10;    Deathtrap Dungeon: Card Game&#10;&#10;&#10;";1995;6.59242;1.2857;4;8;60;8;Card Game, Medieval
930;Böse Buben;"Players play cards onto five lanes of a race track. As soon as there are four goblins in a particular lane, a fight breaks out and the first goblin card played in that lane is ejected from the race. Each additional card in a lane causes another goblin to drop out and as soon as four goblins from one of the five lanes have dropped out the race finishes. Each lane is then scored separately, with the player who has the highest valued goblin or goblins in that lane winning 3 Ducats. There is also a penalty for finishing a race, and after four races, the person with the most Ducats wins.&#10;&#10;";2000;5.34;1.25;2;4;20;12;Card Game, Racing

If you place advanced RACE, you can also make money by betting!&#10;&#10;This game is based on running and betting;&#10;Each player gets 200.000 credits and the deck of &quot;Speed cards&quot; is shuffled and divided among the players, who now sort out the cards in the order they want.&#10;Now the &quot;Contestants cards&quot; are stacked face down. Each card matches the colours of the player pawns (Red, Yellow, Blue, Green, Purple and White). Now there will be an auction of the cards, where you figure our what to buy by the help of your &quot;Speed cards&quot;. Each bidding starts with 10.000 credits and is raised by 10.000 credits. All players have to have at least one (1) &quot;Contestant card&quot;.&#10;&#10;The last player to buy a card starts, and plays a &quot;Speed card&quot; to move all the pawns as the card shows; a pawn can only be moved ahead; either straight or diagonally; never backwards or sideways. Only one pawn is allowed on a spot, and it is NOT allowed to jump over another pawn.&#10;An example of a Speed card could be:&#10;Blue: 6 spaces&#10;White 4  - &#10;Black (means joker/free choice that is not on the card): 2 -&#10;Yellow: 1 -&#10;The speed cards also include &quot;Sprints&quot; and &quot;Injury&quot;&#10;&#10;The player who's colour is first over the finish line gets 200.000 in price money. Second place pays out 150.000, 3rd 100.000 and so on.&#10;Even if your colour have finished the race you continue playing your remaining speed cards.&#10;The race ends when the fifth player have crossed the Finish line or when all &quot;Speed cards&quot; have been played.&#10;&#10;The card dealing of both SC and CC plus the auction is now restarted and the next race goes on untill the agreed amount of races.

934;Die Kette von Saba;"extrapolated from session report:&#10;&#10;The theme of the game is based on the legendary necklace of Saba, which went to the grave with its owner upon her death. Sadly, dastardly grave robbers plundered the tomb and the valuable gems which comprised the necklace were scattered across the globe. Now, a wealthy sheik is anxious to reassemble the necklace and present it as a gift to his lovely bride. Players are charged with the task of assisting the sheik, attempting to purchase the many gems at auction and then reassemble the necklace in the proper fashion.&#10;&#10;The board depicts the frame of the necklace, with space for its 36 missing gems. In total, there are 44 gems in the deck, many of which will ultimately prove to be forgeries. Depending upon the number of players, each player receives from 3 - 7 gems to begin the game, along with $20,000. Four gems are revealed from the remainder of the deck and positioned into the frame.&#10;&#10;The game is played in two major phases. During the first phase, players alternate placing a gem up for auction, ala Modern Art. The auctioneer receives the funds from the high bidder, who receives the gem. The winner has the option of keeping the gem, or placing it into the frame. If placed in the frame, the gem earns $2,000 for other gems it touches and those radiating from it in straight lines, including itself. During phase 2, the reward is reduced to only $1,000 per gem.&#10;&#10;Following an auction, the auctioneer has the opportunity to purchase another gem from the deck for $2,000.  &#10;Phase 1 ends when the gem deck expires. Phase 2 then begins with players reconstructing the necklace. In turn, each player places a gem into the frame and earns funds as described above.&#10;&#10;The twist in the game are the rules which must be followed in reconstructing the necklace. The main rules are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The necklace must be symmetrical, with left and right halves containing the same jewels in the same places. All cards appear twice in the game, so what appears on the left side must appear in the same position on the right side. The only exception to this is the center column. Any duplicate pieces are considered forgeries and are worthless. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Pieces of jewelry containing the same type of gem must be placed in uniform columns. Thus, the first gem placed in a column dictates what kind of gem must appear in that same column. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     The number of gems on a card can only be one greater than the number of gems on the cards directly above it. &#10;&#10;&#10;Once the first gem is placed in a column, it 'locks' that column AND the corresponding symmetrical column. Only gems which meet the above rules can subsequently be placed there.&#10;&#10;The game ends once the necklace is completed. The player with the most money is victorious.&#10;&#10;";1984;5.38295;1.4;3;7;60;8;Economic

937;1825 Unit 1;"1825 is Francis Tresham's &quot;1829 revised&quot; 18xx game. It is released in 3 distinct modules, or units. 1825 Unit 1 and 1825 Unit 2 broadly cover the same area as the 1829 southern board. 1825 Unit 3 covers most of the remainder of England and Scotland, and with unit 2 will cover the same area as the 1829 northern board. Along with the units are a number of expansion kits, which introduce extra money, trains, tiles, companies, and phases. There are currently three, and will be four regional kits, which cover areas of England, Scotland and Wales not included in the three base units.&#10;&#10;The rules are largely 1829 with improvements. Survey parties are now optional, and track is built in much the same way as most other 18xx titles. The stock market is largely the same, but multiple leaps up the market are allowed if dividends are high enough. Trains can now run to, but not through tokened out stations, and company shares become available in &quot;bands&quot; of the same value. All shares in each band become available when one of the companies in the previous band is sold out.&#10;&#10;Play time varies enormously, depending on how much of the game you play. A single unit on its own will last 1 1/2 to 3 hours, and accommodate 2-4 or so players. Multiple units and expansions add to both the number of players and the playing time. Two units and all the expansions should accommodate 3-6 players (7 max. officially) and last for anything from 4 to 8 hours. All three units will work for 4-9 players, and a fair amount longer.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.8224;3.56;2;5;180;14;Trains, Transportation

941;Turbo Taxi;"Flickwerk is a neat little competitive puzzle game, similar in feel to Ricochet Robot. With multiple sets, even more players can participate in the same game.&#10;&#10;Each player has an identical set of 12 tiles displaying part of a network of computer cables. A further set is shuffled and placed face down in the centre of a 3x3 grid, representing the nine rooms through which the cabling will flow. Four markers are placed around the edge of the grid and these represent the only points at which the cabling can leave the grid. The top card of the centre pile is turned over and players have to re-arrange their own tiles in front of them to form a valid network, using the same centre tile as displayed and connecting up the four &ldquo;perimeter&rdquo; markers. First one to complete a valid network wins the centre tile (1 VP). He then rearranges the perimeter markers if he wishes and turns over the next card to be played for.&#10;&#10;The updated edition, Turbo Taxi, features city streets rather than computer cables. The markers on the edge of the grid are a yellow taxi, yellow house, black taxi and black house. Players must ensure that their tiles create valid routes leading the yellow taxi to the yellow house, and black taxi to the black house.&#10;&#10;This game can also be played solo as you try to complete a grid in the least amount of time.&#10;&#10;The contents of Turbo Taxi is:&#10;&#10;1 rulebook (the number may vary for multilanguage editions)&#10;1 city board&#10;&#10;60 cardboard tiles:&#10;&#10;     12 green player&#10;     12 yellow player&#10;     12 blue player&#10;     12 orange player&#10;     12 neutral (with a medal in its back)&#10;&#10;&#10;4 wooden pawns&#10;&#10;     2 black pawns&#10;     2 yellow pawns&#10;&#10;&#10;";2000;6.06397;1.4711;2;4;30;8;Puzzle, Real-time

943;Ligretto;"In Ligretto, each player has their own deck of forty cards, with cards 1-10 in four colors and a unique symbol on the back to identify which cards are theirs. At the start of each round, each player lays out 3-5 cards (depending on the number of players) face up in front of them to create their row; places a face-up stack of ten cards, seeing only the top card, next to their row to create their Ligretto stack; and holds the remaining cards in hand face down.&#10;&#10;Playing at the same time, each player tries to empty their Ligretto stack. If a player has a 1 card on top of any face-up stack, they play it to the center of the table. If they have a 2 card of the same color as any 1 in the center of the table, they can place the 2 card on the 1. All cards in the central piles must be played in ascending order and must be the same color.&#10;&#10;If a player can't play anything, they can reveal cards from the stack in their hand, counting them out in groups of three, then laying them face up while revealing only the top card. They can play this top card onto a central pile as long as the rules for doing so are met.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player empties their Ligretto stack, the round ends. Each player scores 1 point for each of their cards among the central piles, then loses 2 points for each card remaining in their Ligretto stack. In some versions of the game, the player with the highest score wins; in other versions, players then sort all the cards and play another round, with the first player to reach 99 points winning.&#10;&#10;A rules variant for Ligretto allows a player to play cards from their Ligretto stack or the cards in hand onto the cards in their row, but only if the numbers are in descending order and the colors of adjacent cards are not identical.&#10;&#10;";1988;6.19382;1.1693;2;4;10;8;Card Game, Real-time

949;Twixt;"Twixt is a 2-player abstract game invented by Alex Randolph. TwixT is a &quot;connection-type&quot; game, very similar to Hex. Other related games are Havannah and The Game of Y. &quot;Connection type&quot; means the object is to form a path connecting something to something else. This requires very different thinking from the standard battle-type game such as chess or checkers.&#10;&#10;Some old US sets mention a 4-player variant, with 2 teams as in Bridge, but this probably wasn't Randolph's idea.  The game was popular in the 60s and 70s as part of the 3M Bookshelf Series. Avalon Hill then acquired the series and issued the game themselves. Several European publishers have sold the game as well.&#10;&#10;Twixt employs a pegboard, pegs and links.  The playing surface is a 24x24 square pegboard, usually minus the corner holes, with two opposite sides marked with one player's color and the other two sides marked with the other player's color.  Each player has a supply of pegs and links of their color.  50 of each piece type of each color, a total of 200, is an ample supply. Players alternate turns placing pegs and links, if possible, in attempt to have a continuous path of links connecting the two sides of the board with their color.&#10;&#10;After the 3M edition, Randolph added the pie rule. After the first peg is placed, the opponent has the option to swap sides. This reduces the imbalance from the first move advantage.&#10;&#10;On your turn you place one peg of your color on the board, and then add or rearrange your color links. Pegs may be placed in any vacant hole in the board except the corners and the last row on the sides of the opposing player. When two pegs of the same color are at opposite corners of a six hole rectangle (3x2 or 2x3), a link may be placed between those two pegs.  Links may not be placed such that they cross other links.  Multiple links may be added on a single move. Usually, all links are to the peg just placed, but on your move you are allowed to remove as many of your own links as you wish, and add your own links anywhere on the board as long as they are legal as described here.&#10;&#10;When a player connects his two sides with a continuous path of links, he prevents his opponent from doing the same, the game is over, and the player connecting his two sides wins the game. If neither side can complete such a path, the game is a draw.&#10;&#10;";1962;6.60099;2.49;2;4;30;12;Abstract Strategy
950;Four Dragons;"From the designer Frank Branham: A 4 player partnership trick taking game themed around the Mexican Day of the Dead. (A particular favorite holiday of ours, as Sandi and I were married on that day in Marietta Confederate Cemetery.) It is short (about 30 minutes), and rather brain bending.&#10;&#10;Dia De Los Muertos (Day Of The Dead) is played over three days as you send animals, then children, then adults on to the afterlife. It is a basic trick taking game, except that most cards have an action with them. You play as a partnership, and if your side wins scoring cards (the dead or food), you exchange a card with your opponent. Other cards allow swaps between partners, asking a question, cancelling other cards and so on.&#10;&#10;The first time you play, there's a lot of checking the rules, checking the crib sheet, remembering if you exchange cards. You spend more time figuring the game than playing the tricks. But after a couple of hands, it makes sense and you switch to game-playing mode. And here's where it pays. If you enjoy Bridge, you can figure out what your partner signals when they swap a card, or you can read the deck based on what's been played, you will really enjoy Dia De Los Muertos. If you don't like Bridge, or can't figure trick-taking games anyway, steer well clear. It is rather brain-bending.&#10;&#10;The original game has nice native graphics of the dead abroad and has a variant for 3 players. The re-issue as Four Dragons has an oriental theme.&#10;&#10;Not to be confused with:&#10;&#10;     Dia de los Muertos (2007)&#10;     Dia de los Muertos (2016)&#10;&#10;&#10;";2000;6.56546;2.3556;3;4;30;12;Card Game, Deduction, Horror
951;Football Strategy;"Football Strategy boils the sport down to play calling skill. The game's structure is simple: The defensive player selects one of 10 formation cards (ranging from an 8-man line &quot;goal line stand&quot; to a pass prevent defense with five safeties); the offensive player calls a play (a choice of 20, plus punting). Cross-indexing the choices on a matrix shows what happened. Except for &quot;long gains&quot;, the outcome of each play against each defense is always the same. Dice are rolled only to determine the distance of long gains and the results of kickoffs and field goal attempts.&#10;&#10;Each play consumes a prescribed number of seconds, from 15 to 45. The players mark off the time and play four quarters, following the standard football rules.&#10;&#10;For variety, three types of offense (&quot;pro style&quot;, &quot;aerial game&quot; and &quot;ball control&quot;) are available, each with a different, though not radically different, results matrix.&#10;&#10;Simple though it is, the game is engrossing (see the &quot;More Information&quot; screen), and play generally follows realistic patterns, though the handling of punts and on-side kicks (both more effective than in real life) is questionable. Also, because the design changed little after its debut in 1959, the plays and defenses don't reflect the state of the art in contemporary professional football. This is the era of Otto Graham, not Eli Manning.&#10;&#10;For those who are so inclined, Football Strategy lends itself to mathematical analysis. Many years ago, an entrant into the tournament at Origins went to the trouble of using game theory to generate charts showing the optimal mix of plays in different situations. He reached the finals but, in a victory for human intuition over number crunching, lost the championship game by a touchdown and a field goal.&#10;&#10;";1959;6.43717;1.5526;2;4;150;10;Bluffing, Sports

963;The Gardens of the Alhambra;"The Gardens of Alhambra is an abstract influence game from Dirk Henn where each player is represented by plants of a particular color.  Using tiles with all four colors on them, the players place them onto the board in fixed locations.  In doing so, they try to surround victory point markers and capture them.  Of course, since each tile has all of the player's colors represented, every tile placement must be carefully thought-out so that you maximize your points while minimizing them for your opponents.  Ties disqualify players - and so the next highest color total will earn the points.  The player with the most victory points at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;";1993;6.16079;1.7931;2;4;60;8;Abstract Strategy

975;The Keep;"A tie-in to the horror film of the same name. One player controls the evil demon, Molasar, while the others have twelve turns to find the Hilt, the only weapon that can destroy him. It can be hidden in one of six rooms near the heart of a labyrinth. There are intriguing elements to the game; Molasar starts with twelve servants but actually has to &quot;eat&quot; one per turn, reducing his options in terms of blocking the searchers. Combat is handled by the attacked searcher nominating another searcher to play a combat card, which is compared against Molasar's; the loser is forced to &quot;retreat&quot; by the difference in values. If the searcher wins, they pick up a bonus (non-combat) card. All the searchers have (minor) special powers and Molasar has a number of one-off special cards he can play in trying to delay them.&#10;&#10;You can think of it, almost, as a very early, much simpler version of Lord of the Rings - except that in this one, one of the players gets to be Sauron!&#10;&#10;";1983;5.58541;1.6667;3;6;60;10;Horror, Movies / TV / Radio theme

Ruled by a weak and mentally unstable king, Henry VI, demoralized by the defeat in France at the end of the Hundred Years War, and encouraged by the ambitions of Richard, Duke of York, and his sons; the country's noble families used their large private armies in attempts to gain control of the throne.&#10; The game is based on the premise that the powerful Noble families used the Lancastrian and Yorkist princes as pawns in a greater struggle to gain control of England. The nobles in a player's faction use their military and political powers to gain control of royal heirs in an effort to crown one and put him or her on the throne. Of course everyone is out to capture and control the last heir alive, so once acquired, an heir needs to be protected. &#10; Kingmaker has been published by several companies, starting with Philmar under their Ariel imprint in 1974, by Avalon Hill in 1976, by Gibsons Games in 1983, and by TM Games in 1988/9.

997;Canaletto;"An open auction game, players bid for the heirlooms in Venetian palaces, which then get sold on as groups are completed. A circuit of palaces is seeded with the items, and a marker shows which palace is being auctioned. As players bid, they move a gondola along the circuit, which points which the next auction will be when this one is resolved. Players start with 30 points on the scoring track, and there's a marker to allow debt on the same track. Debt costs double at the game end. There's also a marker to allow you to bribe the auctioneer and take a lot for no cost.&#10;&#10;A series price tiles show the potential value of the next completed lot. So you might get to sell your pictures for 16 each, but you might be forced to sell when the price is only 4 each.&#10;&#10;The game is totally open, and you can do the maths to work out the potential benefits to each player, but the game remains fun and quick. Tying the next auction to the current price is a clever idea too, and it can be worth bidding a bit more to control where the next auction will be. Long out of print, Canaletto stands up well with auction games like Medici.&#10;&#10;This later saw incarnations in 1996 as Le Jardin and 2000 as Der Garten des Sonnenk&#195;&#182;nigs.&#10;&#10;";1995;5.3783;1.7143;3;4;45;12;

1029;Lieber bairisch sterben;"From the translation:&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Better to Die Bavarian&rdquo; is the battle for rule over the Bavarian people in 1705. Three sides fight for power: the Imperial Austrian Army (yellow counters/ Symbol:  Imperial Orb); the Prince&rsquo;s soldiers (blue counters/Symbol: the crown), and the rebellious farmers (red counters/Symbol:  Pitchfork). There are also the monks, who surprisingly intervened in the power struggle.&#10;&#10;Players don't represent a particular faction, but instead must court the factions' leadership each turn. He acquires counters of the corresponding color. The main shareholder is awarded the leadership for that turn.  In the course of the game, the leader of a side can change.&#10;&#10;With his faction, a player tries, during the round, to gain points. Points are awarded for the capture of the most important towns: Munich, Regensburg, Passau, Straubing, Landshut, and Burghausen. You have to occupy these with a unit.  Occupying a town brings money into the bank, with which you can pay for the cost of the troops.&#10;&#10;Battles are dealt with by using the Maneuver Cards and Dice. The action cards give support to the players when they court points and power. The points acquired by each player are recorded on the pad.

Each player plays one of four semi-fictional TV networks, and the goal is to end up with the most money when the game ends (which is either when only one network is left on the air, or when certain tiles run out).&#10;Players move pawns around a standard square-track board, with spaces that trigger various events -- drawing an event card, auctioning off a new TV show or star or academy award movie, or triggering a ratings war.&#10;During a ratings war, players lay out the tiles representing their prime-time line-up of shows and movies, along with bonuses for stars and reviews.  Shows with the lowest ratings in their time slot are cancelled, and when a network has no shows left, it goes off the air and the player is out of the game.&#10;&#10;";1987;5.58343;1.9286;3;4;90;10;Economic, Movies / TV / Radio theme

1035;Squad Leader;"A shot disturbs the eerie silence of a deserted city street, punctuated by the frantic footfalls of men seeking cover. One of Kruger&rsquo;s last veteran NCO&rsquo;s lies motionless in the street. The remnants of the dead man&rsquo;s squad are nowhere to be seen&mdash;scattered in nearby houses and gutters&mdash;all thoughts of the advance abandoned with the sudden demise of their leader...the compulsion for revenge obviously overcome by their instinct for self-preservation. Off to the right, Kruger&rsquo;s own men have located the source of the lethal shot and are laying down a steady stream of fire on the church steeple directly ahead. The absence of responding fire suggests that the lone Russian marksman has beat a hasty retreat or been victimized by the withering fire of the German retort. Kruger has seen enough. He is to occupy the church and set up a regimental observation post at once. His orders leave no leeway for delays by a single sniper. He gives the signal to rush the building. Obedient to their training, his men, veterans of France, the Balkans, and 18 months of fighting in Russia, spring to their feet. Seconds later the sharp, staccato retort of a Russian machinegun concludes with the assertiveness of death itself that this time Kruger was wrong.&#10;&#10;This is Squad Leader, a game of WWII tactical combat in Europe. You make the instant decisions resulting in life or death for your men, victory or defeat for your army. You direct the fire of your squad, select your plan of attack, or set your defenses against massed Russian human wave or armor assaults. Will that hedgerow provide adequate cover for your flanking efforts, or will your men be cut down by the American machinegun position in the woods? The decision is irrevocable and yours alone.&#10;&#10;Squad Leader is more than just a game, it is a game system which can be used to portray any WWII infantry action. Its system does for infantry combat what Panzerblitz and Panzer Leader have done for armored warfare games. Squad Leader provides rules for morale, leadership, machineguns, flamethrowers, demo charges, smoke, hidden placement, sewer movement, off-board artillery, radio contact, anti-tank guns, night actions, wire, entrenchments, mines, bunkers, rubble, multi-story building differentiation, fire, river crossings, roadblocks, mortars, and much more.&#10;&#10;Squad Leader utilizes programmed instruction to guide you through 12 scenarios of increasing realism and complexity. The scenarios run the gamut from street fighting in Stalingrad to armored advances across snow covered roads in the Ardennes. A Campaign Game ties the individual scenarios together and allows your own personal leader counter to advance in rank and ability. In addition, a &ldquo;Design Your Own&rdquo; section is included so that players can create an unlimited number of play situations of their own creation.&#10;&#10;Each hex in Squad Leader represents 40 meters of real terrain with counters representing individual leaders, support weapons, and vehicles or 4 man crews and 12 man squads. Each game turn is divided into two player turns with 8 phases, equivalent to two minutes of actual time.&#10;&#10;Squad Leader is not an easy game. Do not attempt it without prior wargaming experience. Squad Leader is rated Tournament Level IV on the A.H. Complexity scale.&#10;&#10;";1977;7.56299;4.0328;2;2;60;14;Wargame, World War II

1041;San Marco;"Players are attempting to score the most points by building up influence in the districts of Venice via their aristocrats. The game uses a card distribution mechanic whereby (in the case of a four-player game) two players draw cards and divide them up into two piles each, the other two players pick one group and the remaining groups go to the players who formed the groups. The action cards allow players to place and remove aristocrats, erect and move bridges, and score individual regions.

1043;Pitstop;"PITSTOP is a motor racing board game. 65 special tiles let the player build virtually any circuit they like. The game comes with multilingual rules (english, spanish, italian, german and french) and instructions to build 10 different F1 circuits.&#10;Each player must set the gear and roll an appropriate number of special dice, that determine the speed of the car and the fuel consuption. The game is turn based and the phasing player, after moving his car, must set the gear for next turn. The box strategy is the most important decision to take. You can decide to complete all the 3 laps without stopping or making one or two pitstops.&#10;The game is not a &quot;simulation&quot;, but to win you need a good amount of skill. Even if the speed of your car is determined by dice, you have to choose carefully the &quot;braking point&quot; in order to enter the curves at the best speed. If you exceed the curve's speed limit, you lose &quot;tyres points&quot;. Of course, you can simulate a championship playing different circuits. What's interesting is that the game strategy changes from circuit to circuit and if you design your own circuit you need all your &quot;driving skill&quot; to be competitive. Rookies can win, but they will find very hard to beat a skilled player.&#10;Game components: 65 tiles to build the circuits (an avarege of 25 tiles are needed for each circuit), 6 plastic sport cars, 12 special dice, 6 &quot;dashboards&quot;, 40 speed limit tokens, 24 plastic pawns, one rules booklet.&#10;&#10;";2001;6.32051;1.5714;2;6;60;10;Racing

They place two balls on each figure. They now take turns and choose one of the following three actions.&#10;&#10;1.Move: Players can move the chosen piece as many squares sideways, forwards or backwards as the piece has balls, if it has 4 balls it must move 4 squares. The pieces may neither jump nor change direction.&#10;&#10;2.Sharing: Players may take all the balls from a selected piece and place one each on any of their other pieces. Exception, if a tower has six balls only five balls may be placed on the other five pieces and so one ball is lost and is removed from the game.&#10;&#10;3.Capturing: Only balls are captured, not pieces. The capturing piece and the threatened piece stay on their own squares. Example a white piece and a brown piece stand two squares apart. They have two balls and three balls respectively. It is whites move and white can remove the three brown balls from the game as long as there is no piece between the white and brown pieces. Pieces whose balls have been captured can be activated again by the sharing of balls.&#10;&#10;Therefore, capturing only limits the movement possibilities, the number of pieces always remains the same.

The pattern of stones in your playing area must always &quot;match&quot; some group of stones remaining on the board.  In two-person play, your opponent will try to take stones that make it easy for him to build matching patterns, and make it hard for you to find good matches on the board.

1063;Schraumen;"Schraumen is a card game based on a nonsense culture, enacting nonsensical laws written on scrolls, paid for with plums.  The name of the game is a portmanteau word from the German Schriftrollen (Scrolls) and Pflaumen (plums).&#10;&#10;The 77 scroll cards are shuffled and the top 11 removed from the game without looking at them.  Deal each player three scrolls and give each player seven plum tokens, which are both money for bidding and victory points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Each scroll is a rule of the game that must be followed when the scroll is played.  If a rule cannot be followed, the scroll is burned in the fire - that is, removed from the game.  Examples include, &quot;Each player must put three plums in the garden,&quot; if at least one player has fewer than three plums.  Or, &quot;The player with the most plums must give all other players a plum,&quot; if two or more players are tied for having the most plums.&#10;&#10;Players take turns reading the scrolls they wish, enacting the new laws, all of which involve plum distribution in some way.  You don't have to enact any of your scrolls unless you have more than five, at which point you MUST activate (or burn, if illegal) enough to bring your hand down to five cards.  A player then draws a scroll, reads it silently, and auctions it off without telling the others what's on it.  He may bid for it himself.&#10;&#10;The game ends when either all scrolls are taken or when the text of a read scroll requires the game to end.

On a turn, the active player takes one sand and one water card from his hand to create mud, then hurls it at another player. (Again, not literally...) That player has a chance to defend herself by playing umbrella cards to block either the sand or water or both, or by playing special cards that, for example, redirect the mud back to the thrower or spread it out on all other players. Other players can add to someone's attack in order to make the perfect mix of mud &ndash; e.g., adding a 1-value water to a muddy mix of 5-value sand and 4-value water &ndash; and by making the perfect mix, they get to redirect the attack at any player.&#10;&#10;After the mudball hits its target or splats on someone's shield, each player refills her hand to seven cards, then the player who was hit in the previous round starts the new round by choosing a target and throwing. The game continues until the deck runs out of cards, in which case players shuffle discarded cards in order to finish the final round.

1091;Explosiv;"Theme&#10;In this simple card game players are Chicago era mobsters trying to make off with briefcases full of stolen loot. But careful, some of those briefcases might explode...&#10;&#10;Aim of the game&#10;Collecting the most points by collecting &quot;explosive cards&quot; with high values.&#10;&#10;Game play&#10;There are four sets of 8 cards, each with values from 1-8. Each player gets a set of one colour.&#10;The explosive cards show briefcases with positive values from 1-8 on one side, and bombs with negative values from 1-8 on the other side. They are shuffled and a number of explosive cards equal to the number of players plus one are laid out, positive side up. The remaining explosive cards are set aside.&#10;&#10;Players try to win as many positive explosive cards as possible. They take turns placing one of their number cards in front of one of the explosive cards. Whoever places the highest total on each explosive cards gets to take that card.&#10;&#10;Rules for card placement:&#10;&#10;     You cannot play another card directly on top of one of your own cards.&#10;     Each number can only be played once per explosive card, i.e. if another player has already played the 4 on an explosive card, you cannot play a 4 on the same explosive.&#10;     8 is an exception; there is no restriction on how many 8s can be played on one explosive card.&#10;&#10;&#10;If there are already 7 number cards on an explosive card, a player can blow it up by adding an 8th card. The explosive card is then turned from its briefcase side to the bomb side, and the player who wins it gets negative points instead.&#10;&#10;A round ends when all players have played all their cards. Card values on each explosive card are added up, with the last card in a row earning its owner an extra two points. The player with the most points in one row wins that explosive card.&#10;&#10;Players get back their number cards and a new round starts with new explosive cards.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all explosive cards are gone or there aren't enough left to start another round.&#10;Players add up the points from all their positive and negative explosive cards. The player with the highest total wins the game.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.89603;1.75;2;4;20;12;Card Game

The top chutes are loaded with your coloured discs in sequence (1 through 5). On your turn, you twist one of the knobs so as to move one of your discs down. The knobs don't have the same indentations for either player, so you're never sure if you're helping the opponent or not.&#10;&#10;First one to get his discs down to the base in sequence wins.

1105;Titus;"Theme&#10;The cards show coins, possibly Roman, but this is a very abstract card game with a memory element.&#10;&#10;Goal&#10;Players try to collect as many victory points as possible by collecting series of four consecutively numbered cards.&#10;&#10;Game play&#10;The 54 coin cards have values from 1 to 19 printed on both sides. The value on one side differs from that of the other side by a maximum of two.&#10;The goal of the game is to collect series of four coins with consecutive values (e.g. 1-2-3-4 or 9-10-11-12). Series of four are exchanged for victory point cards. There are 12 victory point cards with values from 18 to 7. The first player to collect a series gets the 18-point victory card, the next series is worth 17 points and so on, so the sooner you complete series, the better.&#10;&#10;On his/her turn, a player has the following choices:&#10;&#10;     They can take the top card from the draw deck and use it in their own card display.&#10;     They can give the top card from the draw deck to one of the other players and get a single (i.e. not part of a series) card from that player's display. Before they can add it to their own display, they have to turn the card over, so its value can be up to two points lower or higher than what they originally saw.&#10;     They can take the top card from a completed series for which another player has already scored points. That card has to be turned over and used with its other side up too.&#10;&#10;&#10;If a player manages to incorporate a card into his/her card display, they get another turn (limit: 3 consecutive turns). There is no limit on how many rows a player can start in his/her display.&#10;&#10;The game ends when there are no cards left in the draw deck.&#10;The player with the most victory points wins the game.&#10;&#10;";2000;5.21236;1.6;2;4;30;10;Card Game, Memory

1115;Poker;"Poker is played with a standard deck of 52-cards, and sometimes Jokers are added as wild cards. The object of the game is to win the pot which contains all the bets the players have made in a deal.  Players are dealt cards which are usually reduced to a Poker hand of five (5) cards. Betting and bluffing are used in rounds until all bets are squared up, or until all other players have conceded the pot (folded). If all bets have been squared up, the rounds are followed by a &quot;showdown&quot; in which all hands are fully revealed; the one with the best combination of a Poker hand of five (5) cards being the winner.&#10;&#10;The following table describes and ranks the standard Poker hands:&#10;&#10;Five of a Kind (Only if wild cards are in use):  Four cards of the same rank and one wild card (eg: A, A, A, A, Joker).&#10;Straight Flush: A straight with all cards of the same suit (eg: A, K, Q, J, 10: all spades). (The highest Straight Flush is nominally called a Royal Flush)&#10;Four of a Kind:  Four cards of the same rank (eg: A, A, A, A, K).&#10;Full House:  Three of a kind in one rank and a pair in a different rank (eg: A, A, A, K, K). &#10;Flush:  Five cards of the same suit (eg: A, K, Q, J, 9: all spades)&#10;Straight:  Five cards in sequence of rank (eg: A, K, Q, J, 10).&#10;Three of a Kind:  Three cards of the same rank (eg: A, A, A, K, Q).&#10;Two Pair:  Two pairs of different ranks (eg: A, A, K, K, Q).&#10;One Pair:  A pair of cards of the same rank (eg: A, A, K, Q, J).&#10;High Card:  High card without any other higher combination (eg: A, K, Q, J, 9).&#10;&#10;";1810;6.71106;2.4309;2;10;60;12;Bluffing, Card Game

Players auction off the top animal of the deck, or try to complete their set by trading with another player. Highest bid wins, but auctioneer always has the choice to buy the animal for the same price as the highest bid.&#10;Trading is a blind bidding system: both players place their bid face down on the table and reveal them simultaneously to each other. High bidder gets the other player's animal. Both players swap their bid. It's best to bid just a little bit more than your opponent, but just how much did he bid?&#10;&#10;reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;Kuhhandel Master (2009)&#10;&#10;";1985;6.58203;1.6261;3;5;45;10;Animals, Bluffing, Card Game, Humor
1125;Big Shot;"Big Shot is an auction game in which a set of colored cubes is put up for auction each round based on a random die roll. Whoever wins the bid, places those cubes in areas on the game board. Once an area has seven cubes in it, that area is locked and no more cubes can be added. Whoever has the majority of cubes in that area owns it &mdash; except that ties for majority are disregarded, so in a spread of 3/3/1 cubes, the player with only one cube owns that area!&#10;&#10;Players have a limited amount of money with which to bid. They can take one loan each turn, but the first loan gives them only $9 more, while the second loan gives them $8 and the third $7. At the end of the game, the player must repay $10 for each loan taken, with that money coming from the value of the property they now own.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players tally the value of what they own (with some properties being doubled in value if the player owns that region's doubler as well as areas within that region), then repay all loans.

1127;Encounters;"Encounters is a light, &quot;take that&quot; sort of card game with a  D&amp;D / fantasy theme.  The game features a deck of cards consisting of heroes, monsters, weapons and treasure.  Each player starts the game with a party of adventurers (hero cards) on their side (think clerics, fighters, elves, etc.).  During your turn you draw two cards and play two cards, allowing you to perform actions like sending monsters to fight other players, equipping your heroes with weapons, or placing acquired treasure in your personal vault.  A simple combat system is used to resolve monster attacks (which can kill your heroes), and then play passes to the next player.&#10;&#10;Adding some complexity and theme are a number of special ability rules that apply to the different heroes and monsters, such as spells, turning undead,  armor abilities, fiery breath, etc.  When only one player has heroes left standing, that player gets a gold bonus and the round ends.  The cards are collected and a new round begins!  Rinse and repeat until the winning player reaches a certain level of accumulated wealth.&#10;&#10;Re-issued as a CCG with more cards in 1995 under the name Fantasy Adventures.&#10;&#10;";1982;5.892;1.6667;2;4;60;10;Adventure, Card Game, Fantasy, Fighting, Medieval
1129;Archimedes;"This is a strategy game for 2-3 players. It takes place on a 6 sided game board with pieces moving on the triangles. Each player has 4 pawns in the form of dice. The triangular fields of the board are molded so that a corner of a die exactly fits in. The die can be moved from space to space with a simple nudge at the top.&#10;&#10;Object of the game is to get your 4 dice across the board.&#10;&#10;PREPARATION FOR THE GAME WITH TWO ? The younger player chooses a color and puts his 4 dice into four edge spaces of his side of the board.&#10;&#10;WHAT DOES A TURN CONSIST OF?&#10;&#10;1.) Each turn must be executed completely. One might not skip a part of the turn. You may not move a die less than its actual movement unless you reach the finish without completing your die roll  &#10;2.)   Dice may not touch. So a die will block 3 spaces. (2 spaces if on an edge.)&#10;3.)   If a player has no legal move, he skips his turn.&#10;&#10;GAME RULES FOR THREE PLAYERS All rules of the normal game for two persons are valid also for the game with three. &#10;Additionally you must follow these rules: 1.) Set up is different .

Occasionally, Hit-Men can be penalized for making mistakes (cards are drawn and effects are carried out), sometimes attempts at rubbing out mob bosses may occur.  There are also opportunities for negotiation &aacute; la:  &quot;If you help me with a vote of support, I will pay for the next business venture you land on.&quot;  Cards, money and promises are all possible bargaining chips.

1135;Quest For Power;"Quest for Power is billed as a &quot;Game Masterless Role-Playing System&quot;. In actuality, it is a fantasy-themed board game where the board is constructed each play session from randomly dealt cards. It has all the trappings of a role-playing game: character generation, multiple races and professions, skills, spells, weapons, etc. But the actual game play is very much a board game: move along the board, turn over unexplored cards, and deal with the situation given on them. Players can compete against one another, or work cooperatively. Like any good multiplayer game, there are alliances and treacherous betrayals among the players. In the end, in order to defeat the evil lord in his castle (the main objective of the game) at least some of the players will need to team up because the castle lord is more powerful than any one character can handle.&#10;&#10;Evidently the publisher had visions of making a whole series of games based on the R.A.G.G.S. (Random Adventure Game Generating System). The sub-title for the game is &quot;Darkness in the Light&quot; and it is called a &quot;Starter Set for Character Levels 1 - 3&quot;, presumably because other scenarios and rules for higher level characters were planned. As far as I know, no expansions for the game were ever produced and Infinite Imagination, Inc. is no more.&#10;&#10;";1997;3.125;2.0;1;8;90;12;Adventure, Card Game, Exploration, Fantasy, Fighting

Whoever can land at his destination first wins. Fantastische Ballonreise will take you flying all over Germany and its neighbors following a &quot;must visit&quot; list set at the start of the game. At the various stops you will read a card which is descriptive of the folklore of the location and has a special effect on play, including trivia contests, drawing pictures or singing songs. This game was developed as a promotional item for the soft drink manufacturer Fanta. Includes five miniature plastic balloons which go up and down on stands to show their current altitude. Players race their balloons, and special dice are used to determine the change of orientation of a large wind rose, which indicates the amount of movement permitted in each direction, but lines on the board indicate which directions can be travelled in from each space. Cards are dealt out to indicate start position, end position and four intermediate points in each player's route.

Warrior Knights is a game where players use armies to conquer cities and rout opposing forces.  Cities provide income which pays for armies and city improvements.  The interesting aspect of the game, though, is the Assembly where players vote on various motions drawn from the deck of Assembly cards.  These motions are mainly for titles and appointments such as governors, ambassadors and other offices which give the holder additional troops, or for concessions which create additional income for the holder.  As in any game of this nature, alliances are forged and broken between players in order to further goals until one player emerges victorious.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Warrior Knights&#10;&#10;&#10;";1985;6.62575;3.2203;2;6;180;10;Fantasy, Fighting, Medieval, Negotiation, Political, Territory Building

1155;Capitol;"&quot;Architects of the Eternal City&quot;.&#10;&#10;Rivalry in old Rome for the most spectacular buildings and dominance in the Roman prefectures. Whoever uses the 90 blocks and 40 roofs best will win. There are four rounds to a game: Each round has a building phase, an auction phase, a scoring phase and a card drawing phase. In the building phase, players decide on the height of the buildings and build them at the side of the board; if they have the necessary permit, they can build on the board itself. A building is finished when it has a roof; the first roof in a prefecture determines the shape of all other roofs. In the auction phase players can auction for temples, wells and amphitheaters, earning extra points. This is a beautiful production.&#10;&#10;This game by Alan R.

1159;Evo;"217,453,883 years, seven months and 26 days before our time, the first dinosaurs left their home in the sea and climbed onto the land. The ever-changing climate was their first adversary, forcing them to remain constantly on the move. But weather was not their only problem. In order to survive and flourish, they had to evolve, and to do it quickly!&#10;&#10;In Evo, you control the survival and evolution of a species of dinosaurs called Dinos. You guide their migrations to temperate climates, you acquire the perfect genes to develop your Dinos and mutate them, and you push out other creatures that have yet to learn the meaning of the term &quot;dominant species&quot;. At the end of the game, you and your Dinos will not be the winners unless you've evolved more quickly and successfully than everyone else.&#10;&#10;Each turn is divided into six phases, in which Dinos move, fight, reproduce and evolve to ensure that their species has the characteristics to survive the various perils of  prehistoric life. Players earn and spend mutation points to adapt their species for survival &ndash; but don't spend all of them as the remainder are counted to determine the winner.&#10;&#10;With every round of play a meteor moves one step closer to earth.

Each player sits on one side of the board. The red, green, yellow or blue strip at the board&rsquo;s edge determines the color each player uses.&#10;&#10;A player is chosen to be banker. He distributes to each player 1 million dollars (5 x $10,000; 3 x $50,000; 3 x $100,000; 2 x $250,000). He puts the remaining money beside the board and administers it separately from his own money.&#10;&#10;The 25 movie cards are mixed thoroughly and a card is put face down on each board space.&#10;&#10;The 25 miniature screens and the 6 Golden Suns are put beside the board.&#10;&#10;Everyone throws the numbered die once. The player with the highest result (the star equals 6) begins. The game proceeds after him clockwise.&#10;&#10;Play, phase 1 &#10;On his turn, a player throws both dice. The intersection of the column (number-die) and row (letter-die) determines a board space. If the movie card on this space is face down, the player can and should buy this space with this card. He pays $10,000 to the bank and turns the card face up. Now, a miniature screen is put on this space. The player takes a screen from the reserve and puts it on the space so that his color appears through the two gaps in the framework of the screen.&#10;&#10;Finally, the acquired movie card is put into the screen, face up.&#10;&#10;Play, phase 2&#10;As soon as all 25 movie cards are owned and face up in miniature screens on the board, the second game phase begins. Now movie cards can change hands.&#10;&#10;Debts and bankruptcy&#10;If a player must pay a sum and no longer has sufficient cash, he must sell his movie cards and/or Golden Suns. The player chooses what he would like to sell. The bank pays the sums printed on the cards, and Golden Suns fetch the same amount. Sold movie cards are turned face down again, and the screens and Golden Suns go back to the reserve. How-ever, the bank only takes back cards and Golden Suns if a player is insolvent.&#10;&#10;A player who cannot settle his debts must declare bankruptcy. He gives all his remaining cash, miniature screens and Golden Suns back to the bank. The movie cards are turned face down again. The player retires from the game. If movie cards are turned face down in the second game phase, the game returns to the first game phase. Therefore, takeovers of movie cards that belong to other players cannot take place.&#10;&#10;Negotiations &#10;All players are allowed to negotiate with other players anytime, even if it is not their turn. Movie cards may be bought, sold or traded. Players can also negotiate in order to pay debts. They need not necessarily sell to the bank if they receive better purchase offers from players.

1179;Tendix;"PROCESS OF GAME&#10;The player whose turn it is draws one tile from the bag and places it on any free space.&#10;The colour on top is decisive for the effect of the tile. All tiles in the distance that corresponds to the colour (straight line) are turned upside down. Diagonal distances do not count here. Violet (zero) up means of course that nothing is turned. Only a just placed tile can have an effect, there are no chain reactions.&#10;Example: If I lay down a tile with orange up, all tiles that are exactly two spaces away from that tile are turned around, but not those who are one or more than two spaces away. The games lasts until all tiles are placed and the board is completed.&#10;&#10;from the rules translation&#10;OBJECT OF THE GAME&#10;At the end of the game every player counts separately the number of tiles showing his two colours on the top. Now he subtracts the lower number from the higher one. That is his final result.&#10;Example: With red and green as my colors, eight red tiles are tying up and three green ones. Thus I have five points.&#10;If the final result, of two players is the same, the player with more tiles up (sum of the two colours) wins the game.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.5625;2.0;2;3;45;0;

1191;Card Caper;"Each player is dealt a Hidden Card to begin.  The object is to accumulate points by deducing the opponents' Hidden Card as quickly as possible.  Next, each player is dealt an equal portion of the remaining deck, and must give information to the opponents; s/he must lay down a card of Higher Value, Lower Value, Different Value, and Different Suit.  Players are given notepads in the style of Clue to make notes about what cards are played, and what can't be the Hidden Card of each player. Then, each player takes it in turn to roll the die, and either reveal more information, or guess at the identity of an opponents' card.  Wrong guesses give no penalty, so you may as well try.  If you're right, you get one point for each card remaining in that player's hand.  This creates reverse suspense: players race to be first, because cards are dropped each round, and five points for last with a Hidden Card unguessed isn't enough to overcome someone who nailed two Hidden Cards early on.  After everyone has revealed their card, whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;";1997;4.88646;1.0;2;4;30;8;Card Game, Deduction, Memory
1193;The Bottom Line;"The idea of The Bottom Line is to accumulate $5,000,000 and land on the Bank, so as to buy it.  Not as easy as it sounds.  You have $1,000,000 cash, $2,000,000 in debt and 2000 oz. of gold to begin. There are several different businesses, and you can buy parts of them for anywhere from $100,000 each for Residentials, to $600,000 for Casinos.  When someone lands on a property you own, you get $50,000 per property of the same kind you own.  But the big money comes when you collect a full set of property.  Land on a Drive-in Realtor and you can collect multiple millions for selling your set.  There are also Options, which allow you to buy lots from your opponents at nauseatingly low prices, and gold is bought for $600,000 a brick (or in that area) and sells for over $1 million.  Gold seems to be the fast way to money, but you must have the appropriate card, or you'll get fined $100,000.  As players get out of debt (or deeper in it), they will find themselves in a die-rolling race to land on the Bank, or square 17, which allows you to go anywhere you want.  A good finance game, but it was only printed for a year in America. Copies do pop up on eBay (where I got mine).&#10;&#10;";1985;5.50481;1.8333;3;6;90;10;Economic, Negotiation

1207;Big Deal;"Big Deal is a game of corporate business deals. Players are big investors (and I mean big - the smallest notes are $50 million and billions of dollars change hands) and wheeler-dealers.&#10;&#10;Players acquire shares in companies, primarily randomly (picked up as cards), but also possibly through purchase of other players' previous sales. To form the companies they must also acquire resources, which are bought from 4 sets. The pricing mechanism for these is like Palmyra and McMulti - each purchase increases the price and each sale decreases it. Once an appropriate set is acquired for a matching set of (at least two) shares in a company, the company can be formed. Companies pay income to their owners each turn. They can also be sold off at a premium, or split up (provided the owner has enough shares and resources) to gain double income. The real heart of the game comes in the option to conduct hostile takeovers. A player lays one or more shares in a company owned by another player and then starts a bidding war to takeover the company. Each player is bidding to buy the shares of the opponent (bids are per share). The &quot;winner&quot; gets the company and all the shares, the &quot;loser&quot; is paid off at the final bid price. Who is actually the winner and loser depends, of course, on the balance of the final price.&#10;&#10;There is a sudden death variable finish, when assets plummet in value, so there is a tense few final rounds when players can try to realize assets while they are still valuable. During this period the judgment of takeover prices becomes even more tricky (and a gamble).&#10;&#10;";2001;5.55558;3.0;2;6;120;12;Economic

You also have a silver platter; you can use that to send the ghost to another cat --but he'll then have the silver platter for later, and you won't...&#10;&#10;One final note: when multiple players bet on the same meal, their betting tokens remain on the card for the next betting round --this mechanic forces the implicated players to choose something else, and can signal an opportunity for the lone player to be in a position to bet on that meal...&#10;&#10;Simple and fast playing.&#10;&#10;";1993;5.32857;2.0;3;6;20;10;Children's Game
1225;Quest;"&quot;A family game of knights in search of the magical ring, set in the age of myths.&quot;&#10;&#10;Each of the four states of Tirad, Urgad, Galad and Elgad has one large city.  Life in a city flourishes for the inhabitants only when the magical ring is there.  Unfortunately, the ring never stays long in one place.  A band of brave knights is gathered together in Galad where they hear rumours that the ring has been seen in Tirad.  The Quest begins...&#10;&#10;Each player tries to find the ring and transport it to the cities.  As a reward, they receive the seals of these cities.  Collect three different seals to win.  Many obstacles are to be overcome and dragons slain before a knight's quest is complete.&#10;&#10;This is a fairly abstract game.  Each player has three extra &quot;lives&quot; and loses one when defeated by a dragon or when attacking another player.  These lives are replenished by visiting cities.  The ring allows its bearer some significant advantages such as passing through obstacles.  Special spots on the map allow new obstacles to be placed or existing ones to be moved, so a player can be affected even by other players far from him.  The end game can drag a bit as all the other players coordinate their efforts against the leader.&#10;&#10;";1984;5.13993;1.7857;3;6;50;12;Adventure, Fantasy, Medieval
1227;Stonewall;"Designer/Publisher's Description:&#10;&#10;The object of Stonewall is to race your opponents from your starting point to your diagonally opposite corner of a 144 square grid board and back again by the roll of the dice.  Every time you move you may place one wall piece of any length (single,double or triple)on the playing board to help your path or hinder your opponent.  Rolling a four will get you an extra turn and landing on an occupied square will send your opponent back to the start.  Once you have made it to your opposite corner on the turn you pass around it you must change one wall that has already been placed, this can be done to speed up your path home or to force an opponent to go backwards if they are winning.&#10;Stonewall has great strategy play patterns but the dice play throws the element of luck into it.  As a two player game Stonewall is very competitive yet as a four player game it is very social.  New Zealand Consumer Magazine has rated us as the top game in there December 2000 issue after having the game independently play tested,and we are now starting to sell thousands throughout New Zealand.&#10;&#10;";1996;6.12821;1.5;2;4;45;8;Abstract Strategy, Maze
1231;Bandu;"Players take turns choosing blocks and giving them to each other to place on their structure.  A player may pay a certain number of 'beans' to refuse a block and it gets passed to the next player.  When a player's structure falls, they are out of the game.  Last player standing wins.&#10;&#10;Description of Bandu (1992, Milton Bradley, 2-6 players):&#10;Bandu is based upon the game of Bausack. Each player is given a base block and a number of beans. During a turn, a player chooses a wood block from a common supply and either holds a Refuse or Use auction. All player bid with their beans and the winner/loser must place the piece on their tower. If your tower falls you are out of the game. The last tower standing wins.&#10;&#10;Description of Sac Noir (Rio Grande Games, 2-8 players):&#10;There are five variations on how to play. The goal in all of them is to build a tower. The bag contains very different wooden pieces (i.e. an ashlar, an egg, a ring, a fir tree etc.) as well as a sack of beans for the &quot;auction variation&quot; of the game. Depending on the variation you choose, either each player builds his own tower or all build one together. The &quot;auction variations&quot; are the most suspenseful and surprising. One might end up spending quite some beans to avoid building an especially difficult element. Gambling and bluffing abilities are needed just as much as a feeling for statics and construction skills. It's a game with almost endless building possibilities. It's a challenge for steady hands and shaky suspense for clever tacticians.&#10;&#10;";1987;6.7968;1.2862;2;8;45;7;Action / Dexterity, Party Game

1235;Yellowstone;"The eternal turning of the seasons has come full cycle once again. Spring in the hight country enters with a wash of fresh green and the warming chinook, while the show still lies deep on the mountain peaks. As the snow recedes, wild flowers of every hue splash across the lush meadows of the Northern Rockies. The small life in burrow and den creep forth, the birds sing loudly in the pines. Spring is the true beginning of the new year in the awakening wilderness of the Yellowstone.&#10;&#10;The old buck raises his head and turns his gaze to the horizon. The time has come - now to lead the herd to the summer pasture where the bounty of this land will drive away the hunger of winter past. But other animals have come forth from their dens with the spring - the coyote, grizzly bear, mountain lion, and the deadliest predator of all - Man. The natural dangers of this magnificent, rugged land loom ahead. Yet the herd, to prosper, must take to the well-worn trail, seeking to cross the migratory paths of the other grazing masses. As the young gambol and explore, every instinct of the old buck must be devoted to the trek. Without hesitation, he takes the first step toward the future.&#10;&#10;Yellowstone is a less complex game dealing with moving your herd from Winter Pasturage to Summer Pasturage back to Winter Pasturage.  Players control one of the following herds: bison, elk, sheep, or mule deer.  Along the way, you try to pick up Food Points and avoid predators.  You can move the animals in your herd a certain number of hexes in a turn; males are the fastest, females are a bit slower, babies are really slow and should be accompanied by females.  However, when you finally get back to Winter Range, you score more for babies and females than you do for males -- so you may find it necessary to sacrifice a male or two to predators.  Predators are controlled by your opponents, but you get to control them on your turn.  They are not major threats, but inducement to keep moving.  Collect those food points!  You'll need them for winter.&#10;The game's map centers on the Yellowstone Park area and some of the land south of there.&#10;&#10;";1985;5.74021;1.7812;2;4;120;8;Animals, Farming, Racing

Limit Cards specify limits (0 - unlimited) for the number of allowable cards in each of the 5 colors. Players place one of their cards face down in front of them -- these will modify the limits, adding one per card played this round. In turn order, players either challenge a previous player's play, or play card(s).&#10;&#10;Challenging: may &quot;call&quot; any player's last played card. Figure out which card they played last, and count how many of those cards have been discarded. Reveal all face-down cards and add those matching that color to the limit on the Limit Card. If the total exceeds the Limit, you get +1 VP and the challenged gets -2 VP; otherwise, vice versa.&#10;&#10;After resolving a Challenge, flip discard pile face down and place under draw deck WITHOUT shuffling. Players return their Limit-modifying card to hand; reveal a new Limit card and play again (player who got the -2 VP plays first).&#10;&#10;Playing Card(s): place a card to the discard pile, then draw a card.

1265;Mystery Rummy: Jekyll & Hyde;"It's still rummy at heart, with multiple suits of 5 cards each, with the twist being that the suits are designated J for Jekyll, H for Hyde, or J/H for suits that count as both Jekyll and Hyde. The unique mechanism in this version of MR is that there is a two sided card (the 'identity card') on the table next to the draw deck, which has Jekyll on one side, and Hyde on the other. At the start of the game, Dr. Jekyll is showing, but this can change if a &quot;potion&quot; card is played (one of the three gavel cards, cards you can only play one of on your turn). You then flip the identity card over, and draw 2 cards from the draw deck. This is important, because you can only play melds whose suit matches the identity that is currently showing.&#10;&#10;The identity card is important in scoring as well, because any melds that match the identity card when scoring count double, and during scoring if all your meld suits match the current identity card, you shut the other player out! This makes for a tense endgame, especially if you're trying to go for a shutout, because there is a card 'transformation that can change the value of your or an opponents meld from one suit to another.&#10;&#10;Add in one more gavel card type ('work in lab') which lets you draw three cards from the draw deck and keep one, or the top of the discard pile, but only if the card you take matches the identity currently showing. The round ends when one player goes out, and scoring then occurs. Cards in your hand count as negative points.&#10;&#10;This is #3 in the Mystery Rummy series.&#10;&#10;";2001;6.63664;1.531;2;2;45;10;Card Game, Murder / Mystery

The gameboard is a 4x4 array of movable ice floes; more exactly, each one is either on the right or left of its square, and this is critical for adjacency. You split your movement points between your penguins and moving the ice floes (which is good when you can shift several carried penguins), but sometimes the die has you move the polar bear instead. He chases after penguins, sending them back to the starting area.&#10;&#10;The game has some similarities to the German game Im Reich des wei&#195;&#159;en B&#195;&#164;ren that was designed by Charles Lerue and published by Schmidt Spiele in the same year (1991).&#10;&#10;";1991;5.53254;1.2105;2;4;30;6;Animals, Children's Game, Racing

The 20th anniversary edition is a deluxe version of the game with a large color game instruction book, quality game board, and six sets of different colored glass markers that allows play with up to 6 players.&#10;&#10;Other five-in-a-row games include Go-Moku and Renju (which do not feature capturing), and Ninuki-Renju (which does).&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;&#10;    5ive Straight&#10;    Take 5&#10;    5 in a Row&#10;    Go-Moku&#10;    Renju&#10;&#10;&#10;";1977;6.65772;2.0803;2;4;30;8;Abstract Strategy

1299;Trivial Pursuit: Genus IV;"Each player has a circular playing piece with six pie-shaped holes. The goal of the game is to collect a pie in each color. The colors correspond to different question categories.&#10;&#10;The board consists of a circular track with spaces in seven different colors. Six of the colors correspond to question categories while the last color gives a new dice roll. Six spaces along the track are &quot;pie spaces&quot;, and from these there are &quot;spokes&quot; of track leading to the middle of the board.&#10;&#10;Players roll a die and move along the track in any direction they like. When a player stops on a color they get a question of the appropriate category. If the player answers a question correctly while on a pie space, they get a pie of that color (assuming they don't already have it). A correct answer on another square allows the player to roll again.&#10;&#10;Once the player has one pie in each color, she can move along the spokes to the middle of the board to win the game.&#10;&#10;The trivia game of general knowledge questions.

1301;Netrunner;"Netrunner is a cyberpunk-themed collectible card game.  The two players are the Corp (who wins by completing Agendas) and the Runner (who wins by infiltrating the Corp and liberating Agendas).&#10;&#10;Each side has a limited number of both actions and bits (money) to spend per turn; bits are gone once used, and actions must be spent to gain more.&#10;An important thing when evaluating the power of cards is to see the Bit per action ratio.&#10;&#10;One unique feature of this game is that the Runner physically moves on the &quot;board&quot; created by facedown Corp cards.  It has the feel of a &quot;capture the flag&quot; game, with the Runner moving in dataforts to steal Agendas from the Corp.&#10;&#10;Another unique feature is that the Cards are NOT the primary strategy of the game; in fact, players can win by simply &quot;playing with the rules&quot; itself (a concept difficult to understand if you've never played Netrunner).&#10;&#10;Both players play as both Corp and Runner in a game, one after the other, with each player's Runner going against the opponent's Corp.  A winning match provides 10 points and the loser scores points equal to the number of agenda points scored/liberated. The winner of the game is the one who has the most points in the 2 submatches.&#10;&#10;Though Netrunner is traditionally a two-player duel, there are formats that allow for more players (called &quot;The Big Sell Out&quot;).&#10;&#10;";1996;7.44651;2.9336;2;2;45;10;Card Game, Collectible Components, Science Fiction
1303;The Squirrel Game;"A cute game for 5-10 year olds.&#10;   You are a squirrel running around the forest in a figure-eight track, picking up pine cones to bring back to your hoard (which you can enter once every lap).  The first squirrel to gather 15 pine cones in his hoard wins.  Spaces on the track give you one to three pine cones when you land on them, and the special die makes you lose your move now and then --instead, every squirrel gets a free pine cone.&#10;   The tricky part is that your wheelbarrow tips over and loses its contents whenever you exceed its capacity: six pine cones.  Every other squirrel laps the track in the opposite direction to yours, so there are plenty of squirrel encounters.  Every time you leap over another squirrel (going one way or the other), you can steal from or give to him up to three of your cones.  Therein lies all the strategy.&#10;&#10;";1987;5.3131;1.125;2;4;20;5;Children's Game

There are five different tile types, for each of which there is a tribe that can produce goods there. Each player has tribes in only three types. A tile has a maximum number of inhabitants, no production takes place if there are more tribes on a tile.&#10;&#10;The game is won by obtaining amulets, these can only be bought from opposing tribes which are currently producing. Amulets increase the magical power of a player.

1313;1826: Railroading in France and Belgium from 1826;"1826 is an 18xx game set in France and Belgium and reflects the full period of Franco-Belgian railroading, from the origins to the present day. Both countries developed their railroad systems under close Government supervision and this is reflected in the game. The two major French nationalizations are covered, as are the post-war electrification and the introduction of high-speed rail (the TGV).&#10;&#10;1826 is a moderately complex game, designed for experienced players who are looking for something different than the usual round of 1830, 1856 and 1870. Due to the nature of the French political environment, this is not a game for extensive stock market manipulations, nor is it primarily a game of financial management. 1826 is an operationally-centered game in which technology management--getting the right trains on the right companies--is key.&#10;&#10;Companies are incrementally funded, and can buy and sell their own stock. Companies start out as five-share companies and can convert to ten-share companies upon reaching their destination. The first four train classes, including the first-generation permanent trains, have a range in hexes (2, 4, 6 or 10) rather than cities: the last two train classes, which are permanent, have a range in cities. There are two merger corporations, one of which may form relatively early (when the green tiles become available) and the other somewhat later (its first opportunity to form is when brown tiles become available).&#10;&#10;";2000;7.39317;3.8;2;6;210;14;Trains
1315;Africa;"In Africa, players take on the role of explorers in uncharted Africa. The circular playing counters are placed upside down in random locations upon the various circles of the board. Each turn the player may elect to move his explorer to a revealed location anywhere on the board, or move twice, each turn moving 0, 1, or 2 adjacent revealed spaces. The explorer may then take an action (such as reveal an unrevealed tile, or move various revealed tiles to other locations). The tiles represent trade goods (of various sets), nomads, herds of animals, gold, diamonds, and monuments. When the 11th monument is revealed, the game ends. Players tally up their points and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;This being a Knizia game, there are various methods of scoring the revealed tiles, including immediate points, delayed points, opportunity points, and end points.&#10;&#10;Awarded &quot;Best Family Game&quot; title by Games Magazine in 2002.&#10;&#10;";2001;5.99858;1.7664;2;5;60;10;Exploration

Players compete to take either the most or the fewest tricks, depending on the total value of a few hidden cards played at the beginning of each hand.  Problem is, however, players aren't sure whether most or least is good until after all 4 cards are revealed...&#10;&#10;";2001;6.74773;1.3333;3;4;30;10;Card Game

This is done through card play. Two or three numbered cards may be played per turn. The first card determines which goblin moves. The second/third cards determine how far the goblin moves. Goblins ascend the five-tier, 3-D board by landing on top of another goblin. There are also special event tiles that can help or hinder players, and magic stones, which can increase the number of cards in a player's hand.&#10;&#10;";2001;5.95437;1.5625;2;5;30;8;Card Game, Children's Game, Fantasy, Racing

1325;Wild Pirates;"A children's trick-taking card game of racing pirate ships around a series of islands to reach the treasure.  The card play is straightforward with four suits, called trump, and following lead suit.  The number of tricks won determines how many spaces a ship moves, but certain spaces move your ship forward or backward, limit your movement, or force you to take the long way around an island; therefore, there are times when you may not want to win as many tricks as you would be able.  Landing on an opponent's ship sends them back to the closest harbor.  The first ship to land on the treasure wins!&#10;&#10;";1989;5.59144;1.25;3;5;45;8;Card Game, Nautical, Pirates, Racing
1329;Hyle;"Hyle (or Entropy) is played on a board with 5x5 spaces. During each round one player (Chaos) randomly draws and places colored wooden disks on a vinyl/cloth map. After a disk is placed, the other player (Order) may move any disk on the grid horizontally or vertically in order to form palindromes (sequences of colors that run the same forward as backward, for example, red/blue/yellow/blue/red).&#10;&#10;The game is played over two rounds (so that each player assumes each role once) and points are awarded to Order equal to the length of the palindromes formed: blue/blue=2 points, blue/red/blue=3 points, etc. (Note that blue/blue/blue is worth 7 points because it contains two 2-point palindromes and one 3-point palindrome.)&#10;&#10;Hyle 7 is the same game on a 7x7 grid instead of 5x5.&#10;&#10;";1979;6.85123;2.8667;2;2;45;10;Abstract Strategy
1331;Showdown Yahtzee;"Yahtzee meets a board game.  Players move pawns around a board with 12 open spaces and 4 'wild' spaces.  If you land on an open space, you can try to complete one of the 12 standard Yahtzee combinations (not counting the 'Yahtzee' -- more on that later).  If successful, you place the card for that combination on the space and a certain number of your chips to signify ownership.  If another player lands on that space later, they have to match or beat your roll to steal ownership of the board space.  Once a combination has been assigned to a space, it stays there -- so the number of combinations available to fill a blank space on the board decreases throughout the game.  If a player lands on a 'Wild' space, they can try for any combination, then move their piece to the appropriate space and steal ownership.  Also, if a player gets a Yahtzee, they can ignore the space they're on and claim ownership of any space on the board.  Once all combinations have been claimed, each player gets one more turn in which they're allowed to keep playing as long as they keep stealing ownership of a card.  Whoever has the most chips on the board at the end of the game wins.  A very interesting twist on the classic Yahtzee mechanism.&#10;&#10;";1991;5.80561;1.2667;2;4;30;8;Dice
1333;Boom-O;"Boom-O is a simple elimination card game from the makers of Uno. Each player gets 7 cards in hand and three time bomb cards in front of them. Most of the cards in the deck either increase or decrease the timer total. Other cards include familiar commands such as Skip, Reverse, Draw 1 (or 2) and Trade Hands. Player discard one card per turn trying to clear their hand while keeping the timer total under 60. If a player can't play a valid card, they must flip over one of their three time bombs. If a player clears their hand, all other players flip one of their time bombs. Whoever flips all three of their bombs is out of the game.

1335;Gnadenlos!;"Gnadenlos! (Merciless!) is a game in which players enter a prospecting boom town and try to accumulate the most prestige points. Rather than doing the dirty work themselves, players hire adventurers to pan for their gold, fight their gun battles, and sit in for them in the poker games. Since the money hasn't yet come in, these rough-tough folk are hired merely with pieces of paper - IOUs. But on pay day the IOUs come due, and if a player can't pay off debts, then the vultures swoop in.&#10;&#10;Players bid for adventurer cards that will be used in various events - Gold Fever, High Noon, and the Poker Game. Each adventurer carries a number (a rating) for each of the three events. When it's time to play out an event, players place an adventurer card face down. All players simultaneously turn the cards over. The adventurer with the highest number pertaining to the event wins; the lowest loses (ties are usually kept as ties, with both receiving the benefits or penalties). In Gold Fever the winner and second highest receive gold, which may be exchanged for prestige points or used to pay off debts. In High Noon, the winner gets to pick back up two IOUs (not necessarily his or her own); the loser is shot and loses the adventurer card. Also the undertaker advances one space along a timing track. In the Poker Game, the winner moves forward on the prestige track; the loser moves backwards. The IOU cards used in bids for the adventurers are placed in rows along the board, each beside one of six dice symbols (showing 1 through 6). When as many rows as there are players in the game are filled, it's Pay Day. A die is rolled and the outermost card beside the corresponding die symbol is turned up. The player who owns that IOU must pay up. This continues until either all cards of one die symbol have been turned up, or a player cannot meet a debt. The unfortunate player in this case gets a vulture chip and moves back 5 spaces on the prestige track. The game ends either when one player has 3 vulture chips; a player reaches or passes the winning space on the prestige track; or the undertaker reaches his final space. When the game ends the player farthest along the prestige track wins.&#10;&#10;";2001;5.91477;1.925;3;4;45;10;American West, Bluffing

Thirteen red neutral marbles in diamond shape start in the center of the grid. Players can push on any open end of their marbles to push the neutral or opposing marbles off the edge. Every time a player pushes a marble off the edge, they get to move again. First player to push off 7 red marbles or all of his opponent's movable marbles wins.&#10;&#10;";1994;6.25622;1.9;2;2;20;8;Abstract Strategy
1339;Dungeon!;"In many ways &quot;Dungeon!&quot; is similar to Dungeons &amp; Dragons, although much simplified and transformed into a board game. Players explore a dungeon that is divided into levels of increasing difficulty, fighting monsters for valuable treasure. As players venture deeper into the dungeon, the monsters become more difficult and the treasure more valuable. Several character classes each have slightly different fighting abilities &ndash; most notably the wizard, who can cast spells. Combat is simulated using dice; players roll the dice to attack a monster, and if unsuccessful, the dice are rolled to determine the effect of the monster's counter-attack.&#10;&#10;The winner is the first player to bring a certain amount of treasure back to the Dungeon's entrance.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Classic Dungeon&#10;    The New Dungeon&#10;&#10;&#10;";1975;5.99413;1.5548;1;8;60;8;Adventure, Exploration, Fantasy, Fighting

1365;Olix;"Olix is a 2-player abstract strategy game.&#10;&#10;Each player places one piece on the board each turn. Once placed, pieces are never moved nor captured. The board is a simple 11 by 11 square grid.&#10;&#10;The players are attempting to form the largest formation in each of the four different types:&#10;&#10;    O = A rectangle occupying all exterior spaces of the rectangle (meaning there can be a hole or even filled with a friendly or opposing piece).&#10;    L = An L shaped formation (horizontal and vertical - not diagonal) with each leg having at least 3 spaces.&#10;    I = Any horizontal or vertical line of spaces of at least four spaces long.&#10;    X = Any diagonal line of at least four spaces long.&#10;&#10;&#10;Adjacent to the board is a scoreboard showing the lowest possible values for each formation:&#10;&#10;    O = 4, 6, 8, 9&#10;    L = 5, 6, 7, 8&#10;    I = 4, 5, 6, 7 &#10;    X = 4, 5, 6, 7 &#10;&#10;&#10;The player with the largest O, L, I, or X, marks its value on the scoreboard. If both players are tied for the largest formation of a type, both mark their scores on the scoreboard.&#10;&#10;The game ends when either player has an automatic win or when they concede that no further higher scoring formations can be made. The board should be about 66% full at this point and there simply won't be room for any higher scoring formations to be placed. The winner is the first player to form a formation larger than the scoreboard can handle (an automatic win), or at the end of game, the player who won more scoring columns than their opponent, wins. Ties are broken by the player with the furthest advanced scoring marker.&#10;&#10;Originally published in spielbox magazine.&#10;&#10;";1994;5.98636;2.1429;2;2;30;8;Abstract Strategy
1367;Grand National Derby;"This is the precursor to Titan: The Arena (later known as Colossal Arena) and Galaxy: The Dark Ages.&#10;&#10;The theme is horses racing in a steeplechase.  Each round represents a fence that the horses must jump.&#10;&#10;Players bet and then place speed cards on each horse.  When all of the horses have a speed card on them, the one with the lowest speed card is eliminated.  When there are three horses left (which happens after 5 rounds), the players are paid for their bets on the surviving horses.  Earlier bets are worth more.&#10;&#10;The game in each case is essentially similar to Titan: the Arena except:&#10;-  There are no special powers, nor special cards.&#10;-  The deck goes to 0-9, not 0-10.&#10;-  There are no secret bets.&#10;-  In four or five player games, each player gets 4 bets.&#10;-  If there is a tie for lowest card when a round ends, the tied horse furthest on the left is eliminated.  (Play does NOT continue as it does in Titan: the Arena or G:tDA)&#10;&#10;";1996;6.3267;1.7143;2;5;30;10;Animals, Bluffing, Card Game, Racing, Sports

1371;Mustangs;"This game is about dogfights between fighters in WW2 using a very abstracted and simplified method to &quot;simulate&quot; flying.  The game is played in a number of impulses, with faster planes getting to move more often.  A maneuver can take several impulses to complete and is marked with a maneuver marker in the hex that shows the plane's final position.  The object is simply to shoot the other players down before they shoot you down.&#10;&#10;The basic game is relatively simple and pays some attention to realism (e.g., it has a unique system of simulating different maneuvers).  Some attempt was made with additional rules to attempt to add some sense of &quot;realism&quot; (with added complexity):  ammo and fuel limits, critical hits, pilot quality, spotting, multiple planes on each side, etc.&#10;&#10;Includes 95 counters.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;     Mustangs: Expansion Module &#10;&#10;&#10;";1991;6.63527;2.2759;2;4;150;12;Aviation / Flight, Wargame, World War II
1373;Midway;"Very Similar to Guadalcanal.&#10;&#10;The basic idea is each player has their own map of the area (in this case the Midway Island) behind a screen.  Each player &quot;searches&quot; for the enemy fleet by flying search planes to the hex and calling the hex number.  Once found, bombers can be sent in to sink the enemy fleet.  The actual attack is fought on a separate battle board where the ships are first placed on hexes and the attacking planes are placed in hexes to indicate which ship it is attacking.&#10;&#10;The basic game is very simple.  But there are many additional rules which add realism (and complexity):  CAP fighters, surface actions, bases, inaccurate search reports, etc.&#10;&#10;The game is superior with a neutral referee for true double blind play.&#10;&#10;204 counters (5 of them are blanks)&#10;&#10;";1991;6.43595;2.3333;2;2;240;12;Nautical, Wargame, World War II

1377;Danger;"In Danger, players draw numbered and colored cards, trying to collect as many points as possible in each color each round without exceeding the limit of 15 points.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player draws the top card from the deck and places it in front of her in a row for cards of that color; some cards are multicolor, and the player chooses in which row to play these cards. After laying a second card in the round, a player has the option of securing a row at the end of each turn. To secure a row, the player must not have the lowest total in that color when compared to the other players; the player secures a row by turning the last card in that row 90&ordm;. A player can secure only one row each turn.&#10;&#10;If a player exceeds a total of 15 points in a row, that row is now blocked and worth 0 points; the player turns those cards face-down.&#10;&#10;If a player draws a colored card for a row either secured or blocked, she must discard the card. The next player in turn order has the option of taking this discarded card instead of drawing randomly from the deck.&#10;&#10;Once the fourth row of any player is secured or blocked, the round ends immediately. Whoever has the fewest points in a color (with blocked rows worth 0 points) scores nothing for this color; all other players score points equal to the numbers showing in this color in their row. Players then empty their rows and continue playing with the cards remaining in the deck. After five complete rounds, the player with the highest total score wins.&#10;&#10;";2001;4.42288;1.125;3;5;30;8;Card Game

The spaces are filled randomly with the 18 pawns, 3 each of 6 colors, and each player is secretly assigned a color.  Your turn consists of picking up one of the pawns, looking at the number (1, 2, or 3) on the bottom, and moving it that many spaces.  If it lands on another pawn, it pushes it into the pool!

1387;Alaska;"Players compete to collect their container blocks from a central island and return them across the ice sheet to their respective camps before the Spring thaw.&#10;&#10;The game runs in two parts; Winter as the players lay ice tiles across the hex board to the central island, and Spring as the thaw allows the players to remove ice tiles. In your turn, you draw from deck 1 which shows a 1,2 or 3 hex tile and a number on the winter/spring header/footer. After placing the tile in the hex-board, you then draw an action card from deck 2. Most are played immediately (Polar Bear, Frostbite, Found Container) but others you can save and use later (Robbery, Fog, Helicopter). Then the player can move their truck up to free places.&#10;&#10;A 3-hex ice tile counts as one space, so a player with a shorter route may profit early, but when the thaw comes, the other players can quickly remove the shortcut. The Polar Bear acts as a barrier and is often moved around. The other action cards can be beneficial (Found Container means you simply put a container in your truck where you are) or hinder you (Frostbite means you must drop the container and your truck jumps to your camp). Players can only rob dropped containers, not other trucks.&#10;&#10;The Spring thaw only comes when all the ice tiles that can be placed are down. You keep using deck 1, but simply read the alternative symbol for the thaw. There are fewer thaws, so the ice sheet stays active for some time, forcing players to make longer detours. You cannot remove an ice tile if it holds a truck or the bear, and tiles with dropped containers only go last. The game sort of stops when no containers can be collected, but since Helicopter action cards allow you to jump from place to place, the actual end-point is not precise.&#10;&#10;";1979;5.88974;1.4516;2;4;60;12;Transportation
1389;Alles oder Nichts;"Game material&#10;48 playing cards&#10;42 trick indicator cards; 6 colored sets with values of 0 - 6&#10;1 scorepad&#10;1 pen&#10;1 rulebook&#10;&#10;Description of the game&#10;The main task of the 3 - 6 players is to correctly assess their cards. They use a trick indicator card to declare the number of tricks they expect to take. If they're right, they get a bonus. It's also up to the players to decide whether they will openly announce the tricks they expect to take or whether they keep it secret. But beware! A face-up trick indicator card increases the possibility that the other players will be able to influence the outcome. With increased risk it's true that you get: &quot;Alles oder Nichts (Double or Nothing)&quot;.&#10;&#10;A game last for seven rounds. Each player receives:&#10;in the 1st round - 6 cards&#10;in the 2nd round - 5 cards&#10;in the 3rd round - 4 cards&#10;in the 4th round - 3 cards&#10;in the 5th round - 4 cards&#10;in the 6th round - 5 cards&#10;in the 7th round - 6 cards&#10;&#10;After the cards are dealt, the dealer turns over the top card of the remaining cards. The color of this card is the trump color. After distributing the cards, players take the playing cards into their hand. Each player now judges for himself how many tricks he thinks he can take. Players select the appropriate card from their trick indicator cards and place it face-down in front of themselves&#10;&#10;Once all players have made their decision, the dealer, starting with the player to his left, asks each player if he wants to openly announce the number of tricks he plans to take (by turning over his trick indicator card) or if he wishes to keep it secret. Once each player has indicated his decision, the dealer asks the other players in clockwise order until all players, including the dealer have indicated their decision. Turning over the trick indicator card brings a higher risk but also potentially more points.&#10;&#10;Rules of play:&#10;&#10;Players must follow suit (play the same color as the card that was lead) if it is possible for them to do so.&#10;&#10;If a player cannot follow suit, he has two possibilities:&#10;1. Play trump - play a card of the trump color&#10;2. Throw off - play a card that is neither the trump color nor the color that was lead. You can never win a trick when you throw off.&#10;&#10;If no trump was played, the player who played the highest card of the suit that was lead wins the trick.&#10;If trump was played, the player who played the highest trump card wins the trick.&#10;&#10;If the trump color was lead, it must also be followed. If a player does not have any cards in the trump color, he must throw off a card with another color.&#10;&#10;Scoring&#10;Secret trick indicator cards:&#10;Players whose trick indicator cards were face-down get one point for each trick that they took. Players who took exactly as many tricks as noted on their trick indicator card get a 3 point bonus.&#10;&#10;Openly declared trick indicator cards:&#10;Players whose trick indicator cards were turned face-up only get points get if they take exactly as many tricks as they predicted. If they fulfill this condition, their score is equal to the number of tricks they took multiplied by 2 plus the 3 point bonus.&#10;&#10;Goal of the game&#10;The goal of the game is to have the most points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;";1988;5.05882;2.0;3;6;30;8;Card Game

There are six rows of cards representing airplane stunts, and no row may contain two cards of the same color or shape. Each turn a player draws a card from his pile (or on the first turn from a neutral pile), then all players try to find a legal placement for that card; the first player to do so draws a card from his pile to start the next turn. Calling an incorrect row earns that player a crash chip, and three crash chips eliminates him from the game. The first player to run out of cards wins.&#10;&#10;Crash Pilot has also been published with a grocery store theme as Check Out.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.42768;1.125;2;5;20;6;Aviation / Flight, Children's Game, Real-time

1403;Turn the Tide;"Players are dealt a hand of 12 from a deck of 1-60 (the remainder go back in the box for the whole game), and then lay out marker cards that show the other players the strength of their hand. Another scoring deck of 24 has values of 1-12; two cards from this deck are laid face up.&#10;&#10;Players choose one card from their hand in secret and reveal them simultaneously. The highest value played takes the lowest scoring card, which goes face-up to a pile in front of you. The second highest takes the other card likewise. Remaining cards are discounted. Then look at everyone's face-up deck: the highest scoring player turns one of his or her marker cards over! (The original game had cockatoos becoming cuckoos; this edition is themed on lifesavers). At the end of a round, players score according to their markers cards that they managed to save (cockatoos or life-savers).&#10;&#10;There is a further twist! Players then pick up all their playing hand, and pass it clockwise. So as each round commences, you are using the cards previously used by your neighbor! Are you smarter? Can you make a better fist of the same hand your neighbor had? Play out rounds until all players have had each hand. Top score wins.&#10;&#10;";1997;6.7809;1.5171;3;5;30;10;Card Game

1407;Alcatraz;"Players try to escape from the prison island Alcatraz in this quite abstract game. Board resembles a chess board, it's a 9x9 grid where players must move their pieces from one end to the other. Each piece can move horizontally or vertically as many spaces as the player wishes, but there are few complications: the guards. Each row has a guard. Whenever a piece moves to a row, the guard on that row moves as many spaces towards the piece as the piece moved (if you move three rows up, the guard on that row moves three spaces towards you). If the guard catches you, the move is illegal. Of course, it's legal to make the guards catch other players' pieces... The first player to have three of their four pieces escape wins.&#10;&#10;Alcatraz is fun, quick game and a nice brain-teaser, especially with more than two players when the board gets quite crowded.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.50932;1.9091;2;4;30;10;Abstract Strategy
1409;Spawn: The Game;"While this is essentially a Parchessi variant, the game mechanics were well adapted to the comic book character Spawn, as he was expressed at the time.&#10;&#10;Players play cards from their hands which may affect themselves, affect another player or function as tiles on the board.  In this case, they alter the movement point cost to enter that space.&#10;&#10;Next, players roll dice to build up power (movement) points and move their figure appropriately.&#10;&#10;As in Parcheesi, the first player to complete one trip around the board wins.&#10;&#10;Other items spice up this mix.  Power chips may be spent to add to your roll, but must be spent before you roll.  The Violator pawn sends a Spawn pawn back.

1417;Alibi;"The Whodunit Card Game: &quot;Murder in the big city, and you must solve the crime.  Brenda's dead, and foul play is suspected. To win, find out who did it, where, when, how, and why.&quot;&#10;&#10;This is a card game that shares some similarities with Clue, but adds some other questions to the mix, like what time of day did it happen, and what was the killer's motive? To the usual process of elimination and deduction found in most Clue-type games, they've added scoring elements.  You can collect sets of clues and reveal them to score points.  Obviously, though, this aids the other players as well by eliminating some categories.&#10;&#10;You start with a number of cards, each of which contains a specific clue. As play progresses, you can attempt to accumulate all the clues in a category, which will earn you points based on what turn you choose to reveal your set.&#10;&#10;Each turn, you are allowed to direct a question to a specific player.  The question must be answerable with a number.  For example, you may ask &quot;How many Cookie Carpenter cards do you have?&quot;  or  &quot;How many Jealousy cards have you seen?&quot;  Doing this will help you eliminate some of the icons (clues) on your score sheet.&#10;&#10;Your other option during your turn is to make an accusation. You need to be careful though, since this also will end the game! On the other hand, you do get some bonus points for being the First Accuser.&#10;&#10;Cards are passed after each player's turn. For the first round it is only one, but it increases by 1 for every round the game lasts.&#10;&#10;Once someone decides to accuse, all players can make any guesses they want to, filling in the answers they've come up with for each category (Suspect, Place, Weapon, Emotion).  You can also fill in the specific answer within a category for more points. The problem with guessing, though, is that wrong answers result in negative points, and the First Accuser loses double!&#10;&#10;";1993;5.51394;1.7925;3;10;45;10;Card Game, Deduction, Murder / Mystery
1419;Pylos;"In Pylos, you want to be one who places the final ball on top of the pyramid. Sounds simple enough, right?&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player has fifteen balls, either light or dark, and they take turns placing them on a game board that has sixteen indentations on it in a 4x4 grid. Once four balls have been placed next to one another in a square, a ball can be placed on top of them, forming a second level of play. Players can then place balls on this second level, eventually allowing a ball to be placed on the third level &ndash; and once that level is full, which requires only four balls, a final ball can be placed on the fourth level, with that player winning the game.&#10;&#10;If a player forms a square of his own color &ndash; that is, four balls placed next to one another on the same level &ndash; that player can remove one or two of his balls (that don't support anything) from anywhere on the board and place them in his reserve, thereby giving him more balls to place in the future. Whenever a player forms a square that's not entirely his own color, he can &quot;stack&quot; one of his pieces &ndash; that is, he can take any ball and place it on this square, locking some pieces in place and making a move without having to place a piece from his reserve.&#10;&#10;The rules include a variant for children (that removes the square bonus) and one for experts (that allows a player to return 1-2 balls to his reserve when he creates a line of his color).&#10;&#10;Reimplements&#10;&#10;&#10;    Strat-O-Sphere&#10;&#10;&#10;";1993;6.30798;1.9187;2;2;10;8;Abstract Strategy

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10; Lost Worlds is the most popular entry in Alfred Leonardi's line of book games, which also includes Ace of Aces.  Each player has a character card and a booklet (and sometimes special Tactics, Luck, or Spell cards) for one of about fifty (and growing) medieval-fantasy characters.  Characters can range from barbarian warriors to animated skeletons to elven archers to unicorns &mdash; even two different dragons.  Booklets are traded and, as each player selects a move, a reference grid in the books determine the results (wounds, off-balance maneuvers, and so on).  Combat continues until one fighter or the other expires.&#10;&#10;An interesting feature of the Lost Worlds system is that, under some versions of the rules, characters may improve their abilities as they gain experience.  In theory, you are supposed to keep track of your progress with each character, and if one is utterly killed, it will have to start over without its improved skills.&#10;&#10;Part of the Lost Worlds series of books.&#10;&#10;";1983;6.55732;1.6905;2;2;10;10;Book, Fantasy, Fighting, Medieval
1423;Storm over Arnhem;"This is the first of the Area-Impulse games done by Avalon Hill which later included Thunder at Cassino, Turning Point: Stalingrad and Breakout Normandy. The game simulates the ferocious battle for the Arnhem Bridge on September 18-21, 1944.&#10;&#10;The game begins with the British holding the area around the bridge, surrounded by the Germans. They try to hold out for as long as they can.&#10;&#10;Each full turn covers 8 hours and includes many mini-turns (or impulses). Each impulse, the player can move or fire a small number units. Once moved or fired, the units are &quot;committed&quot; and cannot move or fire again until the next turn.&#10;&#10;Combat is handled by calculating attack and defense values with each side adding the roll of 2 dice. The difference (if the attacker has the higher total) in final point values is the number of casualty points the defender must lose by retreating or destroying units.&#10;&#10;The games is of relatively low complexity for a wargame and rates 3 (out of 10) on AH's difficulty scale.&#10;&#10;";1981;7.19343;2.8992;2;2;300;12;Wargame, World War II

Upon landing, the remaining force tries to reach targets  (sub pens, caissons, docked ships, supply tanks, etc.) and destroy them.&#10;&#10;The German guards are handled by the game system and arrive via random draw and placement and move by most direct route to the nearest British commando.

1431;War at Sea (Second Edition);"War at Sea is a simple, strategic wargame covering the Battle of the Atlantic and naval warfare in the Mediterranean in WW2.&#10;&#10;The game divides the contested seas into 6 areas.  Each turn the players move their ships from home ports to one or more of the areas.&#10;&#10;After all ships have been moved a battle occurs.  After a number of rounds, until one side or the other retreats or loses all of his/her ships, the player with ships left takes control of the area and scores a number of &quot;Points of Control (POC)&quot;.  If German U-boats survive anti-submarine combat they may stay in the area, even if the area contains Allied ships, and prevent the Allies from controlling the area and scoring points for it.&#10;&#10;The Allied player has the additional challenge of escorting convoys across the Atlantic. Any that reach England score one POC. If one reaches Russia it scores a BIG three POCs.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill&#10;&#10;";1976;6.55929;1.9559;2;2;120;12;Nautical, Wargame, World War II

1443;Alpha Blitz;"Alpha Blitz consists of two different games.&#10;&#10;Alpha is a word game for 2 players. there are 98 cards with letters on them and 10 blitz cards showing a lightning bolts. These are shuffled together and six are laid out between the players. Each player gets 3 cards in their start hand. On your turn you try to make the longest word possible with the six letters showing on the table using each letter as many times as you want. For example you could make the word letters with the letters L, E, T, R, and S showing. Each turn you must cover one letter with a card from your hand and then draw another card. You may do this before or after you make a word. If you cover a letter with a blitz card that pile is permanently out so as the game progresses there are less letters to use. You receive 1 point for making a word. 1 point for every letter in the word more then the number of letter piles. You also get 1 point for each J, K, Qu, X and Z you use. The game ends when there are only 2 letter piles left.&#10;&#10;Blitz is a word game for 3-6 players. Each player has a hand of 3 cards. 2 cards are placed face down in front of each player. All cards are turned up at the same time. The first player to call out a word that can be formed with the letters showing gets 1 point plus 1 point for each J, K, Qu, X and Z they used. The second player to call out a word gets 2 points but the word must be longer then the previous word. This continues until all players have called out a word or passed due to not seeing a legal word. Each round is started by covering a letter from your hand. The game ends when one player has both letter piles covered with a blitz card.&#10;&#10;Alpha Blitz was awarded the title &quot;Best Word Game&quot; by Games Magazine in 1999.&#10;&#10;";1998;4.875;1.8333;2;6;30;10;Card Game, Word Game

1447;1841: Railways in Northern Italy;"1841 is the apex (or nadir depending on your point of view) of 18xx stock-market manipulation. Set in Northern Italy during a period of rapid political change (borders for playable hexes change twice during the course of the game) the game is one of the most difficult even for experienced 18xx players.&#10;&#10;The greatest innovations center on the ability of companies to own shares in other public companies and the merging of companies. Train obsolescence is rapid and unforgiving, and it is quite possible for forced-purchase trains to be obsolete before they get a chance to run. Capitalization is on a per-share basis throughout the game and train prices are steep &gt;1400 for an 8 train - the largest.&#10;&#10;There are 8 historical corporations and eight, named but ahistorical &quot;generic&quot; corporations. These are normally used simply as investment vehicles to maximize the amount of capital available to &quot;successful&quot; companies close to Milan. Northern Italy is mountainous, especially near the off-board Alpine areas and to the South of the map, making progress slow and expensive for the outlying historical companies.&#10;&#10;1841 has a reputation as a very long game, but is not necessarily much longer than games, such as 1870, which have a very large bank. It can be completed in four hours.&#10;&#10;Chris Lawson's game kit is one version that is available and is of his usual high (for a game kit) quality. A large amount of time with scissors and craft knife to cut out the stock and tiles can be expected.  Deep Thought Games now publishes 1841v2 which incorporates changes by Manlio Manzini to address some of the perceived shortcomings with the original which was designed by Federico Vellani with Manlio as a co-author.&#10;&#10;Description by Steve Thomas:&#10;&#10;1841 is the 18xx game of choice for many players, though some hate it. Designed, and originally published as 1839 by Federico Vellani, it is set in northern Italy. The McGuffin here is that 1841 is the 18xx game which is least about actually building a railway and most about manipulating the stock market and managing the extremely fierce train obsolescence. Route development has its place, but unless the players can get the rest of the game about right they are doomed, and it is this which polarizes players' views of the game. When it first became available it whetted the slightly jaded palates of some players since the dividing line between success and abject failure is so narrow. 1841 achieves this by allowing companies to buy and sell shares in each other, and to merge with one another. These factors result in frequent and hard-to-predict changes to the order in which the companies operate. It's exciting and dynamic, and the only real downside, at least for &quot;the financiers who've had enough of the engineers&quot;, to misquote the 1853 box art, is the length of the game. At typically seven hours it cannot sensibly be played in an evening. Even so, the game is usually well worth the investment of time, though it's certainly not for the novice.&#10;&#10;";1994;7.91335;4.4773;2;8;300;14;Economic, Post-Napoleonic, Trains, Transportation

Each player, armed with a fistful of dice, starts his turn by rolling 5 dice and placing as many of them as possible on a card, though you must always place at least one if you can.  Each card has 6 rows, with from 1 to six dice pictured in each row.  These are in various combinations, and dice must be placed in order in each row.  As long as you place at least one die, and you have not used all of your 5 dice, you can then choose to roll again.  If you choose to stop, or you roll dice with no legal placement available, your turn is over.&#10;&#10;Scoring is achieved by placing the last die in a row and scoring can be a negative.  When the last row of a card is scored it is removed and a new card replaces it.

While XXXenophile's theme and artwork were rated R, Girl Genius can be played by families without grandma getting embarrassed.  (However, a couple cards do feature scantily dressed women.)&#10;&#10;Each player gets a five-card hand and 12 cards are laid out face-down in a patchwork pattern.  Each card has colored symbols along each side, a point value, and special instructions. On your turn, you turn over one face-down card then spin any face-up card 180 degrees.  After spinning, if any of the symbols on the edges of the spun card match the symbols on one or more of the surrounding cards, you &quot;pop&quot; the card(s) with the most matching symbols.  &quot;Popping&quot; a card means you must follow the instructions on the card (whether helpful or harmful) and then (usually) add it to your score pile.  Cards in your hand are used to replace any popped cards.  The game is played until one player has 100 points or has captured a combination of submarine and dirigible cards.&#10;&#10;Unlike most of Cheapass Games's games, this one is professionally manufactured with full color, laminated cards with rounded corners.&#10;&#10;";2001;6.04974;1.9355;2;4;30;10;Card Game, Comic Book / Strip
1465;Wizard;"The trick-taking game Wizard uses a sixty-card deck that consists of the traditional 52-card deck (1-13 in four suits) along with four Wizards (high) and four Jesters (low).&#10;&#10;Players compete over multiple rounds based on the number of players, and whoever ends with the highest score wins. In each round, players are dealt a hand of cards &mdash; one card in the first round, two cards in the second, three in the third, etc. &mdash; then trump is determined by flipping the top card of the undealt deck; if a suit is revealed, that suit is trump, while if the card turned up is a Jester, it is turned down and there is no trump for that round. If the card turned up is a Wizard, the dealer chooses one of the 4 suits as the trump suit. The dealer cannot choose &quot;no trump&quot;. On the last round of each game all cards are dealt out so there is no trump. Players then state how many tricks they expect to win in the round.&#10;&#10;The playing and winning of the tricks uses mostly standard trick-taking rules. If a player leads a suited card, then all other players must follow suit, if possible. If a player leads a Jester, then the second player determines the suit led. If a player leads a Wizard, then those who follow can play whatever they want. However, in all cases a player may always play a Wizard or Jester, even if they hold cards in the suit led.&#10;&#10;After each player has played a card, determine the winner of the trick as follows: If one or more Wizards were played, the player of the first Wizard wins the trick, collects the cards, and leads to the next trick. If not, whoever played the highest trump wins the trick. If not, whoever played the highest card of the suit led wins the trick. If all players played Jesters, whoever played the first Jester wins.&#10;&#10;After all tricks have been played, players tally their score for the round. If a player matched their bid, winning exactly as many tricks as stated at the start of the round, they score 20 points, plus 10 points for each trick taken. If a player missed their bid, they lose 10 points for each trick that they were off, whether they took more or fewer than predicted.&#10;&#10;A common variant in Wizard is to not allow the total number of tricks bid in a round to match the round number, thereby forcing (at least) one player to be off each round.&#10;&#10;";1984;6.98434;1.7061;3;6;45;10;Card Game, Fantasy

The four sides of the pyramid are earned by answering a question with triangular precision, one for each zone on the map (Americas, Europe, Water, and Universal - which is Africa, Asia and the other 3 zones).&#10;&#10;The rubi (top of the pyramid) is earned by first having the four sides done, then answering a final question.

1484;Clue: The Great Museum Caper;"This is a semi-cooperative game which puts the &quot;thief&quot; against the rest of the players, who take the role of detectives.  As the thief, you secretly plot your movements around a private art museum.  As you go, the detectives take turns trying to find you with their eyes, the video cameras, or motion detectors.  You can deactivate the cameras, and you can even cut off the power to the entire museum to mask your movements.  Another advantage is that the thief gets a turn after every detective's individual turn.&#10;&#10;Another problem for the detectives is the fact that, once the thief has picked up a painting, she can take her next turn before removing the painting from the gameboard.  The good guys know the vicinity, but won't know her exact location, as the thief is now up to 3 squares away from that spot. If a detective ever spots you with the naked eye, secret movement is over, and the thief's token is placed on the board for all to see.  This can get frantic, since the thief can only move 1-3 spaces, while detectives roll a d6 for movement!&#10;&#10;The thief player has to decide when to attempt a getaway. The catch is, some of the windows and doors are locked.  There are actual lock pieces, and you must flip over the one you are attempting to open (instant detective frenzy!). If she has stolen 3 paintings (in a one-off game), and manages to get out, she wins.  In a tournament style game, each player gets a turn at being the thief, so the number of paintings needed will vary based on the other players' scores.&#10;&#10;1991 Mensa Select&#10;&#10;Also selected by Family Fun Magazine as one of the best games.&#10;&#10;Original name by inventors was Heist.

1486;Plunder;"A very strange game from the Thomson Bros.  Each player attempts to collect a set of 4 items and deliver them to his home.  You go to stores owned by other players and buy them but early in the game it becomes night and then the only recourse is to steal them.  It looks like a monopoly clone on the surface but is much more chaotic.  One player plays a thief who can move pretty quickly using special paths.  One player is the Mayor who has a lot of money.  The other players play merchants who have a store and residence.&#10;&#10;4 tokens are placed in each store and any player (except a thief) may enter a store and buy one.  You can only carry one item at a time but you may drop any item at any time.  You can enter stores that are closed and residences to steal items but if caught you may end up going to jail which is harsh.&#10;&#10;This game falls in the light and wacky catagory.&#10;&#10;";1997;9.3;2.0;4;6;90;10;

After you take a role in the movie, you can roll a die and try to &quot;act&quot;, or you can &quot;rehearse&quot; to improve your odds. As you work, you'll earn money and fame, and you can trade those things at the casting office for higher status, which brings you the ability to take better-paying roles.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, you add up your money, fame, and status points, and the player with the highest score is the best actor at Deadwood Studios!&#10;&#10;";1999;5.89203;1.5057;2;8;60;12;American West, Dice, Economic, Humor, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Print & Play

They must build and staff factories to produce resources, which are then used to build more factories, and purchase any of 13 outpost improvements that give different advantages (ranging from production technologies, resource storage, and increased population maximums to resource producing stations).

Marion Crawford, Ave Roma Immortalis, II, IS&#10;&#10;Seven centuries of history are contained in this box.&#10;&#10;Imperium Romanum II is the game of the Roman Empire -the greatest and most glorious empire the world has ever known. The rules book describes the intricacies of Roman political, economic, and military conflict. The game-map portrays the whole Roman world, from Britannia to Parthia, in exacting detail, and the 800 game counters depict individual legions, fleets, and auxiliary units. The thirty-five scenarios examine every major Roman war, civil and external, through 700 years that shaped the Western World. &#10;Many games claim historical accuracy; players will be astonished at the wealth of historical detail in this one. Many games claim to be playable; players will be very pleased at how elegantly Imperium Romanum II joins scholarly historical concern to an eminently playable game system. In short, Imperium Romanum II is the definitive game of the Roman Empire.&#10;&#10;Imperium Romanum II is based on West End Games classic Imperium Romanum. More accurate, informative and attractive maps, an increase in the number of unit colors and types, rules substantially revised with an eye to readability, clarity, and historical accuracy, and the addition of new scenarios (and the elimination of some older ones) are just some of the improvements players will find in this thorough revision.&#10;&#10;What You Will Do In Imperium Romanum II &#10;Storm the walls of Rome; plunder provinces; reconquer the Empire; strive for the Imperial purple; war against the Parthians; fight great battles at sea; fight barbarian invasions; mass barbarian hordes to plunder the West; conquer Gaul; cross the Rubicon. &#10;Fight against aristocratic oppression, or for aristocratic stability.

1497;Dino Hunt;"A collectible card game from Steve Jackson aimed directly at the kids.&#10;&#10;The core game comes with everything you need and boosters just add more options.  Each player gets 10 action points each turn to go back in time and collect dinosaurs.  You start your turn by rolling a die and putting out that many new dinos for hunting.  You travel to different time periods and hunt the dinos by rolling a die and comparing the total to a list on the card.  A good roll allows you to capture the dino but a bad roll can have other consequences including ending your turn prematurely.  Each dino cost variable action points to hunt and moving from one time period to another also costs action points.  You also collect various items that can help you and there are action cards that have good and bad effects.  When the stack of dinos has been exhausted and all dinos have been captured or have escaped the game is over.  Whoever has captured the most dino points wins.&#10;&#10;The beauty of this game is not in game play but the cards themselves.  There is a large picture of the dinosaur and enough info to put a reference book to shame.  As a bonus there is also a phonetic spelling of the name.  Without the special cards this game can be played by 5 year olds with a little help.&#10;&#10;";1996;5.37472;1.4516;2;4;30;8;Card Game, Collectible Components, Prehistoric

How high will you bid before the tension and bluffing get to you? And how good's your eye --- can you spot a forgery when you buy one?&#10;&#10;The MASTERPIECE game combines the excitement of a fast-paced board game with the glamour and sophistication of a game that deals with fine art. Some of the world's greatest paintings, illustrated in full-color postcards, are an integral part of gameplay.&#10;&#10;The high-stakes world of international art --- and the power plays of an auction --- will entertain and enlighten as you join a particularly eccentric group of collectors who've all come in search of a MASTERPIECE.&#10;&#10;Each player takes the role of an art collector and tries to amass the greatest fortune in cash and the value of art pieces in their collection.&#10;&#10;The painting cards are randomized and placed face down in a stack.  Matching size value cards are also mixed and placed face down in a stack.  These value cards indicate the worth of the painting ranging from forgery (zero) to $1,000,000.  Each player receives an equal sum of money and one painting with value card which are clipped together so that all players can see the painting and only the owning player can see the value.  When paintings are drawn from the stack, a value card is clipped to them in this fashion.  Players move around the board by die roll and land on spaces that allow the player to collect money from the bank, receive a painting from the stack, sell a painting to the bank for its value, sell a painting to the bank for a specified amount, auction one of their paintings to the highest bidding opponent, or auction the top painting in the stack to the highest bidder.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the painting stack is exhausted.

1502;Hotel;"Hotel Tycoon, first published as Hotels, is a Monopoly-like game in which hotel tycoons try to buy and build the best hotels in the world and compete for guests. The game caters two to four players, ages eight and up.

A successful hotel consists of three components: the land on which it's built, the hotel buildings, and the entrances by which guests arrive in the hotels. All three components need to be bought separately with in-game money. As in Monopoly, money is earned by players who end up on one of the entrances of your hotels, after their dice roll. The more luxurious the hotel, the more money a guest will earn you. Money you can use to build extensions to your existing hotels, buying new entrances or pay other players when you arrive at their hotels.&#10;&#10;The game consists out of cardboard, three-dimensional hotel buildings, recreational grounds and entrance stairs that can be placed on the large game board.&#10;&#10;";1974;5.52919;1.3944;2;4;60;8;Economic
1503;Mid-East Peace;"Mid-East Peace is one of those great games where luck really doesn't play a part, once initial country selection is made.&#10;&#10;The game is set during the pressure cooker situation of the early 90's and the tension of the game certainly reflects this. Players out-maneuver and out-bluff one another so as to gain the riches of the region, while making sure they spend enough of the &quot;oil/money&quot; to ensure the safety of their state. The tension is kept up by secret deployment of forces and the continual angst of balancing resource spending with the saving necessary to come off the winner. It is, usually, the richest player, the one who has probably spent least on 'defense' throughout the game that will come off the victor. But, the twist is that the game can end in war or peace, and there are different victory conditions depending on which of the two outcomes it ends in. A very hard balance to maintain.&#10;&#10;";1990;5.13079;2.4375;2;6;180;12;Modern Warfare, Political, Wargame

1512;Hexagony;"This game was originally published by the designer as Bin'Fa under the company name Taoist Arts, Inc. It was released a few years later as Hexagony by Avalon Hill, and then again as Bin'Fa by the designer under the company name Kenterprises. The Avalon Hill version has slightly different rules. Alan Moon is credited with development of this version. Bin'Fa will be re-released February 2015 after undergoing numerous alterations and rule changes from its previous incarnations.&#10;&#10;Bin'Fa/2015 Edition is described by the Publisher/Designer:&#10;&#10;Bin&rsquo;Fa is a game of strategy for 2 to 6 players, each of whom controls an army of twelve units, a general and a supply pawn. In multiple army games, each player controls either two or three armies. The object of the game is to capture the opposing army units by surrounding them, thereby removing them from play.&#10;&#10;The game board is divided into six separate triangles, which offer almost limitless possibilities for new terrain each game. Each player places his armies at the start of the game in his home battle sector. The board also contains terrain markers and vortex markers, which the armies can use to jump around and appear unexpectedly behind enemy lines, presenting a sudden and unforeseen threat to the rear.&#10;&#10;The terrain transforms what would otherwise be a featureless playing area into one that more closely resembles the terrain over which actual battles are fought. With an almost incalculably large number of possible different terrain configurations, strategy cannot be decided in advance. The beginner always stands a chance against the experienced player.&#10;&#10;Bin&acute;Fa armies use up supplies when they move just as real armies do. On taking possession of the dice, players must choose between moving their army units on the battle sector (which uses up supplies) or using their turn to move the supply marker in hope of obtaining fresh supplies.&#10;&#10;One of the most exciting aspects of Bin&acute;Fa is the &quot;cavalry charge.&quot; As long as a player has sufficient supplies and is lucky enough to avoid rolling a double, it is possible to send a force dashing across the board to attack enemy units and (hopefully) return.&#10;&#10;The game of Bin&acute;Fa brings together two strands whose origins go back to very ancient times.

1513;The Republic of Rome;"The Republic of Rome is an abstraction of over 250 years of history.  It simulates the politics of the Roman Senate during the republic.  The players take the part of various factions vying for the control of the senate.  They control the various powerful families of the time, who compete for state offices, military command, economic concessions and new adherents.  To win the player must get their faction to become the most powerful in Rome.  While doing this, however, a balance must be maintained.  A hostile world situation, and the vagaries of the public of Rome means that the players must also cooperate so that Rome herself doesn't go down under this pressure.  If Rome does not last, neither does the senate, and all players lose!&#10;&#10;Players make proposals to the Senate which other players then vote on. A player's ability to make proposals is determined by which Offices his/her Senators hold. A player's influence in votes is determined by the number of Senators they have recruited and the level of influence those Senators have obtained. Proposals may include assigning Senators to govern provinces (generating revenue), recruiting an army to fight an external foe, addressing the concerns of the Roman people, assigning offices or prosecuting previous office holders. Players have to co-operate to overcome the various threats that the game sends against Rome (wars, famine, unrest, bankruptcy) whilst working to build their own Senators' and Generals' positions and undermine that of their opponents. A powerful General or an influential Senator may become Emperor (thus winning the game) but equally may suddenly fall to the plague or an assassin's blade.&#10;&#10;";1990;7.5391;4.3686;1;6;300;14;Ancient, Negotiation, Political, Wargame

The board itself is hinged and moves as players move their metal balls across the boards' surface.&#10;&#10;Which ever way the board is tilting towards decides whose turn it is.&#10;&#10;It is possible that a player might get two turns in a row if the board still tilts towards them after they move a ball.&#10;&#10;The first player to get all 8 of their balls to the other side of the tilt-table wins.&#10;&#10;";1996;5.20207;1.75;2;2;20;8;Abstract Strategy, Action / Dexterity
1515;Upwords;"Players take turns forming words on either an 8x8 (original and Winning Moves &quot;new classic&quot; versions) or a 10x10 (most later versions) grid. Words may be formed horizontally or vertically, as in Scrabble, but, as the title suggests, the letters may also be stacked.  This allows already played words to change into different words by stacking new letters (up to a limit of 5 high). For example, LATE could be changed to CATER and then to BELATED. Instead of having different values for each letter, when a new word is formed, the number of tiles used in that word is counted.  If the whole word is one tile high (no stacking), then the word scores 2 points per tile.  However, if there are any stacked tiles, you score one point per tile in the word, including those underneath.  This results in scoring that increases as the game continues, even for simpler words.&#10;&#10;";1982;5.75158;1.6767;2;4;90;8;Word Game
1516;USAC Auto Racing;"Billed as the Official Game of the United States Auto Club this is one of Avalon Hill's early Sports Illustrated branded games. The game was created by Jim Barnes who sold the game at a booth that he set up at Indy and other race track promenades in the 1970s. Mr. Barnes struck a deal with Avalon Hill and the game was changed a little by the development team at AH and published with the SI logo on the box.  On an oval track you can run up to 33 cars. Each car has its own driver card derived from the performance of the actual drivers of the featured Indy race. Ongais, Foyt, Unser, Sneva, Mears, Rutherford etc, every driver that was in the that year's Indy has a card with a color photo on one side and game racing charts on the other side.  One Card set, for an even year Indy race from 1978 through 1986, was included in the box with the other card sets offered through the AH mail order program.&#10;&#10;Each driver card has 6 tables on the back. Three of the tables for movement, you chose whether you are going to drive normally, charge or back off and then roll 2 dice, referencing the appropriate table. The result will tell you how far you can move or if you have encountered car trouble. There are 2 trouble tables that can slow you down or knock you out of the race. There is also a pit stop table which controls how many turns you must sit in the pits before re-entering the race.&#10;&#10;The game is driven on Stats and can be played solitaire.&#10;&#10;";1979;6.06448;1.7241;2;33;120;10;Racing, Sports
1517;Ani-Mayhem;"In this CCG you lay sites to build the game board. You then place items and disasters at the sites. You chose 4 starting characters and create a deck with other characters, actions, equipment etc. You also have a separate deck of combat cards that you can use to enchant your fight or charm ability. You move your characters in groups around the board trying to get items. As you do you will set off disasters that have to be dealt with. Sometimes they guard a site but a lot of them start roaming the board looking for fights. You win by acquiring over half the items or by having the most when all items have been acquired.&#10;&#10;The first set (0) consists of 303 cards and has art from the films Bubblegum Crisis, El Hazard, Ramma 1/2, and Tenchi Muyo.&#10;&#10;The second set (1) consists of 220 cards and has art from Armitage III, Dominion Tank Police, Phantom Quest Corp., Project A-Ko, and Oh My Goddess.&#10;&#10;In the third set (Dragon Ball Z) consists of 232 cards and all art is exclusively from Dragon Ball Z the series.&#10;&#10;There are also a fairly large number (32) of promotional cards.&#10;&#10;";1996;5.4062;3.2;1;4;45;10;Card Game, Collectible Components, Exploration, Fighting

The world we see around us is an illusion hiding True Reality, a horrible illusion fabricated to keep humanity at bay, and to prevent our awakening.&#10;&#10;That is the premise to the darkest of the CCGs.  You play an Archon or an Angel of Death.  You lay beings or regions around you and to the side in a Tarot type layout.  On these cards you can play influence cards.  Your spell casters can play spells and there are commandments that you can play that have instant effects.  On your turn you try to influence the population at large by moving population counters onto your outer cards then to your inner cards then onto the card representing you.  With 2 players there are 9 population markers and the first to sway 5 wins.  Of course along the way your beings will be throwing everything but the kitchen sink at each other.&#10;&#10;Between the subject matter and the dark and very graphic cards this is not a kids game.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.91337;2.5238;2;99;45;14;Card Game, Collectible Components, Fighting, Horror, Mature / Adult
1520;Monad;"The object of the game is to collect round cards known as &quot;Monads,&quot; which look like yin-yang symbols. The players do this by Trading, Buying, and Leaping with other cards.&#10;&#10;Monad / Die 1. Million uses a deck of cards with six colors (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, and Purple). Half of these are called &quot;Warm&quot; colors (Red, Orange, and Yellow), and the others are &quot;Cool&quot; colors (Green, Blue, and Purple). The majority of cards has one symbol on them (known as &quot;Commons&quot;), but there is one card of each color with 2-5 colors on them (known as &quot;Bis,&quot; &quot;Tris,&quot; &quot;Quads,&quot; and &quot;Quints&quot;). At the start of the game, each player is assigned one of the six colors as their &quot;identity&quot; and is dealt six Commons and one &quot;Bonus&quot; card (which shows three pairs of colors). The Bis, Tris, Quads, and Quints are placed face up in separate piles in the center of the table.&#10;&#10;On their turn, a player attempts to get higher numbered cards into their hand. The easiest way is by &quot;Trading.&quot; To trade, a player turns in a pair of cards with the same number of symbols but of opposite colors (one warm and one cool) and takes the top card from the stack with the next highest number of symbols. When they turn in two Quints, they gain a Monad. If the two cards turned in match one of the pairs on their bonus card, they may also draw the top card from each of the lower stacks. They may also use cards of the same color as their Identity as wild cards, which are treated as having any number of symbols.&#10;&#10;The player can turn in more than two cards and &quot;Leap&quot; to a higher stack. This allows them to select a card with a higher number of symbols. Finally, they can &quot;Buy&quot; a card. Buying cards uses the numbers located on each card. The player turns in a number of cards which total greater than the number on the card they are after. Monads can be purchased for 80 points.&#10;&#10;A player can also draw the top card from the deck but doing so prevents them from taking any other action that turn.&#10;&#10;The first player to accumulate a given number of Monads (which varies depending on the number of players in the game) is the winner.&#10;&#10;Belongs to the 3M Gamette Series&#10;&#10;";1968;6.24664;2.0286;2;4;60;10;Card Game

1522;Get Out;"Get Out is a Monopoly-style game with three tracks instead of one, and a couple of nice mechanical twists. The squares on the outer board are jobs, and the squares on the middle board are apartments. You can take as many jobs as you want, but each one slows you down, making it harder to get to Payday.

1523;Pharao;"This is the third in the Pharao-Brettspiele series of games, the other two being Isis and Ramses.&#10;The board is an Ancient Egyptian Senet board, and the game can be played as such if one supplies the throwing sticks (randomizing devices that eventually evolved into dice; available in commercial Senet sets or easily home-made).  Note, however, that there are only 4 pieces per player instead of the almost-standard 5 (historically, the number of pieces per player varied between 5 and 10), so a fifth piece would ideally need to be supplied.&#10;H. A. Renz chose, once more, to use the components for an entirely different, modern abstract strategy game.  Each player uses two special dice to move both his pieces and his adversary's (this is the only game of the triad to have a random element).  The object of the game is to either &quot;push&quot; all adversary pieces into the water (a special square), occupy the &quot;happiness&quot; square with one's last remaining piece, or box the adversary in so he cannot move.&#10;Note how driving towards one victory condition (by adversary elimination) actually opens up a victory opportunity for the adversary --a neat twist.&#10;Remarkably, the starting position is asymmetric because the board is asymmetric.  There does not seem to be much of an advantage or handicap to being one side or the other.&#10;&#10;";1984;6.63158;1.5;2;2;30;7;Abstract Strategy, Ancient, Dice

1531;Ritter ohne Furcht und Tadel;"Depending upon the number of players, each player receives 1 or 2 knights.  Each of these knights lists a series of dice pips on the card, some of which are red in color.  These red numbers are the knights defensive abilities, and he will block these numbers if rolled by an opponent during a competition.  For instance, Upollonius Wolkenburg has a 1, 2 and 3 in red.  Thus, he will block one of each of these numbers each time dice are rolled by an opponent in a competition.  Some knights have less numbers in red, but they usually have a greater attack strength, meaning they can roll more dice in combat.  This mechanism borrows very heavily from many role playing and fantasy games.&#10;&#10;In addition to these 'defense' numbers and the attack dice chart, each knight card also has charts for prizes won (1 - 15) and damage points (1 - 10).  There are also nice illustrations on each card ... about the only kind thing I can say about the game.&#10;&#10;Each player also receives a 'lady' card.  Each lady possesses a number of characteristics, including hair color, build, height and personality.  When granting her favor to a knight (which is indicated by placing a corresponding token onto a knight card), the idea is to seek out a knight who desires similar characteristics in a lady.&#10;&#10;The start player challenges an opposing knight with one of his knights.  A challenge cannot be refused.  These two enter battle, which involves each player tossing a number of dice equal to their attack strength into the tournament field.  In mounted combat, any 1's, 2's or 3's thrown strike a blow, unless these are blocked by the opponent.  If any of these dice strike, the knight falls from his horse and the knight suffers hit points equal to the number of blows which were landed.  If only one knight is struck and falls from his horse, the opponent wins and earns a prize for himself and for his lady.  If both knights fall from their horse, then the match continues on foot.  This involves more dice rolling, but 4's, 5's and 6's now strike.  This continues until one knight concedes or reaches 10 damage points, at which time he is out of the tournament (and out of the game).&#10;&#10;The next player in turn order then challenges a knight.  This process is repeated until there is only one healthy knight remaining. The round then ends and victory points are doled out to the knight and lady who won the most prizes.  There are also potential bonuses which add to the players' scores.&#10;&#10;";1998;4.34;1.6154;2;10;45;12;Dice, Fighting, Medieval

Max and the ghost chasers begin the game in rooms of their choice.  The Max and his chasers move room to room.  Max moves invisibly, showing himself only from time to time.  The creatures living around the castle determine when Max must show himself.  After each game round, one animal is removed from the board.  When all animals of one type have been removed, Max must show which room he is in and how he got there.

1534;Jump!;"The premise is quite simple: jump out of airplanes and get your guys to land as close to the coast as possible. The closer you are to the coast, the more points you score. If you splash down into the water, however, you will score negative points. The further from the shore you are in the water, the more negative points you will suffer. &#10;The board depicts a section of land, followed by a beach and ocean. There is a lake on one space of the land section, and a one-space island in the ocean. The board also has two 'landing' tracks running parallel to each other. The tokens are placed on these tracks once they have leapt from the planes. Finally, the board also has a scoring track to tabulate the points ultimately scored following a round, as well as a cumulative scoring track which runs the perimeter of the board.&#10;&#10;Each player loads his or her tokens (which vary with the number of players) into the two airplanes. There are four rows of seats in the airplanes, and where your tokens are positioned will be important when considering the timing of your jumps. Players then each receive six cards plus one 'jump' card. These cards dictate the actions that will occur during the turn. Most of the cards move one of the planes (red or yellow) forward or backward a certain number of spaces. Other cards allow a player to switch seats in or between the planes, cancel any jump attempts that round or blow a jumper off course a space. Finally, the jump card causes one of the player's token to leap from the plane and land on the space directly below where he was seated.&#10;&#10;The mechanics are quite simple. Each player lays a card face down, and then all reveal their cards simultaneously. Beginning with the start player (which rotates each round), each player carries out the action his card depicts. However, if a player reveals a 'jump' card, then opponents who played a 'wind' or 'cancel jump' card must reveal them, taking the appropriate action. The 'wind' card can be disastrous, as that player gets to bump the jumper one space up or down. This may have the effect of landing the jumper in the water. Cards played are discarded, with the exception of the 'jump' card, which is retrieved back into the player's hand.&#10;&#10;When a token leaps from a plane (due to the play of a 'jump' card), he is placed on the outside track of the landing track. If another token leaps into the same space, it is placed along the inside track. Any other tokens that land on that same space are shoved back to the next empty space on the landing track. This can result in a scoring reduction if the token is being moved further from the coast, but can also be a positive occurrence if this causes the token to be moved onto the land as opposed to falling into the water.&#10;&#10;Play continues until all tokens have jumped from the planes. They are then moved one-by-one to the scoring track, beginning with the token furthest from the shore. There is a positive scoring track for those tokens that were fortunate enough to land on solid ground, and a negative scoring track for those jumpers who splashed into the water. The more tokens that successfully landed on the ground, the more points the players closest to the shore will score. The converse is also true!&#10;&#10;Once all tokens have been repositioned onto the scoring tracks, each player tallies his final results and these are marked on the cumulative scoring track. This entire process is then repeated two more times and the player with the most cumulative points following the third round is victorious.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.20879;1.7143;2;5;45;10;Aviation / Flight

Also, pit cards throw a monkeywrench in&mdash;usually you'll lose a turn, but now and then you'll get extra fast service, a burst of speed in coming out of the pit, or special brakes good for one extra corner.&#10;&#10;The race runs for up to 10 laps; the player furthest past the finish line when all players have had the same number of turns wins.&#10;The game's simplicity makes it accessible to younger players, whilst it remains enjoyable by adults.&#10;&#10;";1962;6.69123;1.7049;2;6;120;10;Racing, Sports
1536;Lord of the Fries;"Game Synopsis: Lord of the Fries is a thematic sequel to Give Me The Brain!. It takes place at the same restaurant, has the same cast of characters, and requires roughly the same equipment. But the game is entirely different. &#10;Players choose orders (sometimes randomly, sometime not) from the figuratively colorful Friedey's menu, and try to fill them with cards from their hands. Some orders are easy, like the Cowabunga. One Cow Meat, one Bun. Some are a little harder, like the Chickabunga Conga: same as a Chickabunga (Bird Meat plus Bun), plus Fries and a Drink. Sound easy? Now try your hand at a Lord of the Fries, a Meat Munch, or the infamous Patriarch (Fish Meat, Cheese, Bun, Fries, Drink, and the oft-maligned Strawberry Pie).&#10;&#10;";1998;5.96462;1.2867;3;8;45;12;Card Game, Zombies

1538;Het 1845 Spel;"As your life progresses (from 1-100, in a 'snakes/ladders' environment) you will need to have certain insurance to avoid major personal disasters. The one with the most of money after becoming 100 years old, wins.&#10;&#10;Interesting mechanic is that you can buy all kinds of insurance that prevent disaster or bring you money. You cannot buy all of the insurances available though and you have to choose which insurance policies you buy at the beginning of the game. During the game calamities happen which cost money unless you have taken out the correct insurance.&#10;&#10;This is a promotion game, but it also has an educative purpose as you teaches what insurances are intended for.&#10;&#10;Published in celebration of the merger of two companies, namely &quot;De Nederlanden van 1845&quot; and &quot;Nationale Levensverzekering-Bank&quot;, into &quot;Nationale Nederlanden&quot;.

1540;BattleTech;"BattleTech (aka &quot;BT&quot;) is a science-fiction tactical wargame in which players battle one another with various war machines.  The heart of the game is the &quot;BattleMech&quot; (aka Mech), a giant fighting robot; typical games have each player controlling from 1-4 Mechs.  Vehicles, infantry, power armour, aircraft and other unit types also exist.  The game system includes details such as varying weapon ranges, heat generation, and discrete hit locations (torso, arms, legs, etc.). Mechs vary greatly by mobility and firepower, and players can choose from provided designs or take the time to create their own Mechs from scratch.  The game is typically played on one or more hex mapsheets or mounted map boards; optional rules are also available for hexless play.  An extensive line of pewter figurines (Mechs, vehicles, and the like) are available from Iron Wind Metals. (Many earlier BattleTech figures were produced and sold by Ral Partha, which still handles the figure line in Europe.)&#10;&#10;As in earlier editions of BattleTech, introductory box sets are available.  The current versions are the BattleTech: Beginner Box (contains 2 plastic Mechs, a map, and simplified quick-start Mech rules). Designed to immediately follow this is the BattleTech: A Game of Armored Combat box (8 plastic Mechs, mapsheets, cardboard Mech standees, and the full rules for Mechs and basic gear).  Lastly, the BattleTech: Clan Invasion box adds further Mechs and maps and slightly expands the rules to include more advanced technologies and unit types, while moving a player forward through the game's timeline.&#10;&#10;The main component of the current generation of BattleTech is a series of rulebooks.  The primary ones are either Total Warfare, which covers combined arms (Mechs, combat vehicles, battle armor, aircraft etc), or the BattleTech: BattleMech Manual, which continues on from the introductory box sets in offering more advanced but still Mech-only play.  The rest of the current in-print rulebook line is covered below.&#10;&#10;BT is also supplemented by a variety of Technical Readouts, which provide gameplay and background data on Mechs and other units at various time periods in the game-universe history.  Accompanying these are pregenerated PDF record sheet collections, which have full gameplay statistics for each unit in a corresponding Technical Readout and are designed to be printed out for tabletop play.  Also common are map sets, which add additional mapsheets for scenario variety; era-based sourcebooks detailing the history and factions of the setting; and the aforementioned miniatures (which are not required for play).&#10;&#10;For about six years the game was known as &quot;Classic BattleTech&quot;, to differentiate it from the WizKids-produced collectible miniatures game &quot;MechWarrior: Dark Age&quot;.  This branding has been long since abandoned and no longer appears on any products, but many BGG entries still feature it even if not applicable.&#10;&#10;Rulebooks&#10;&#10;     Total Warfare (standard game rules for the most common unit types)&#10;     BattleTech: BattleMech Manual (a Mech-only rulebook, but rewritten for clarity and featuring most relevant gear from Tactical Operations and Interstellar Operations)&#10;     TechManual (standard unit construction)&#10;     Tactical Operations: Advanced Rules (advanced ground rules)&#10;     Tactical Operations: Advanced Units &amp; Equipment (advanced equipment and unit construction)&#10;     Strategic Operations: Advanced Aerospace Rules&#10;     BattleTech: Interstellar Operations (era-specific equipment, various strategic wargaming rulesets)&#10;     Campaign Operations (rules for campaigns and running your own mercenary group)&#10;     A Time of War: The BattleTech RPG (RPG rules)&#10;     A Time of War Companion (RPG supplement)&#10;     MechWarrior: Destiny (separate, narrative-style RPG)&#10;     BattleTech: Alpha Strike &#226;&#128;&#147; Commander's Edition (fast-play BT variant with simplified units and a higher unit count)&#10;&#10;&#10;Introductory Supplements&#10;&#10;     BattleTech Technical Readout: Succession Wars&#10;     Record Sheets: Succession Wars&#10;     Map Pack: Grasslands&#10;     BattleTech: Technical Readout &#226;&#128;&#147; Clan Invasion&#10;     Record Sheets: Clan Invasion&#10;&#10;&#10;Other Supplements (partial list)&#10;&#10;     BattleTech: Chaos Campaign&#10;     BattleTech: Battle of Tukayyid&#10;     BattleTech: MapPack &#226;&#128;&#147; Battle of Tukayyid&#10;     BattleTech: Shattered Fortress&#10;     BattleTech: Era Report &#226;&#128;&#147; 3052&#10;     BattleTech: Era Report &#226;&#128;&#147; 3145&#10;     BattleTech: Field Manual &#226;&#128;&#147; 3145&#10;&#10;&#10;Superseded Rulesets (partial list)&#10;&#10;     BattleTech: CityTech&#10;     AeroTech: The BattleTech Game of Fighter Combat&#10;     AeroTech 2&#10;     Classic BattleTech RPG&#10;&#10;&#10;";1985;7.09992;3.4138;2;4;0;12;Collectible Components, Fighting, Miniatures, Science Fiction, Wargame

1544;Beyond Balderdash;"Beyond Balderdash is the expanded second edition of Balderdash.  Balderdash is based on bluffing your opponents into guessing your false definitions to obscure words.  Beyond Balderdash adds several new categories to the mix:  Movies (make up a plot), Dates (say what happened on it), People (say what the person did), and Initials (make up what they stand for).  The real answers are often even more outrageous than the bluffs, so the game offers plenty of laughs.&#10;&#10;The UK version of Absolute Balderdash is a different variation with different questions.  Notably, the UK Absolute Balderdash features a &quot;Law&quot; category, where you complete the law given on the card. Beyond Balderdash is lacking that category, and features in its place a &quot;Date&quot; category, where you are given a date and must come up with the historical significance.  The Canadian and Australian versions of Absolute Balderdash also feature the Date category instead of Law.&#10;&#10;Absolute and Beyond were merged into the game Balderdash at least by 2003 (there is a 1997 edition of Beyond Balderdash still with the Dates category).  Now, the vanilla version of Balderdash is the five-category edition with Laws instead of Dates.  Balderdash with a single category (word definitions) has not existed since at least 2003.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Kokkelimonke Jubileum&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Balderdash&#10;&#10;&#10;";1993;6.82787;1.4714;2;6;45;10;Bluffing, Party Game, Trivia, Word Game

1548;Libero;"Abstract Soccer Game played on a grid of squares. Each player has eleven wooden tokens - nine basic ones, one libero (sweeper) and one goalkeeper. Each piece has a small dent on top so the ball can be placed on it. &#10;In a turn, the active player can pass the ball as many times as s/he wishes, in a straight unblocked line (diagonal, too), and move one piece. Regular pieces move any distance diagonally, while the libero can move orthogonally as well (same as the goalie, who is restricted to the box, though). A piece that reaches a field adjacent to an opponent piece with the ball can grab the ball. Goals can be scored if a piece that is not offside can play the ball into the goal in a straight line.&#10;&#10;One half time is played until a player has scored three goals. After two half times, the player with most goals is the winner (in case of a tie, an extension is played).&#10;&#10;";1984;6.75;0.0;2;2;45;10;Abstract Strategy, Sports

Monsters include such loathesome creatures as trolls, ogres, zombies, goblins, lycanthropes, men, and the horribly alluring succubus.  Each has an offensive potential as well as a defensive capability based on the type of creature vs. the Hero's weapon and how mightily he wields it.

1574;Tactics II;"The hobby of wargaming was born in the 1950s with the publication of the game Tactics. TACTICS II is a direct descendant of this original board wargame.&#10;&#10;TACTICS II is sort of like military chess. Different pieces, called &quot;units&quot; in wargames, have different capabilities just like chess pieces. The major difference is that a player can move all his pieces each turn, and after all his pieces are moved, battles are resolved against the enemy units his pieces are next to (adjacent to).&#10;&#10;The other major difference between wargames and chess is that wargames have a mapboard, divided into squares or hexagons for movement purposes. TACTICS II has a 22&quot; x 28&quot; mapboard portraying a fictional continent with two countries, Blue and Red. Terrain includes roads, rivers, woods, mountains, beaches, and cities. The Blue Capital can only be reached over a vast plain, bordered on the left by mountains and on the right by woods. The Red Capital is on an island and can only be reached across one of several bridges or by an amphibious invasion.&#10;&#10;Game features include special functions for headquarters units, terrain effects, invasions, airborne assaults, weather effects, replacements, isolation, and even nuclear weapons. Units represent infantry (25 per side), armor (6), mountain (2), airborne (2), headquarters (1+2+4), and amphibious troops (2) and 6 counters without symbol (You can use as replacement for headquarters having fired their nuclear missile; the 3 types of headquarter have different nuclear missiles). 100 counters in all.&#10;&#10;TACTICS II was almost always part of the Avalon Hill game line, primarily because it was sold as an introductory wargame for a number of reasons. The rules introduced many basic board wargaming concepts and were relatively low in complexity. The rulebook is divided into a basic game and a tournament game (advanced game). Both are balanced and relatively quick playing. As the opposing armies are identical in size and composition, victory is gained by a combination of logic, foresight, luck, common sense, and skill in military strategy and tactics.&#10;&#10;In 1981, an unauthorized hex map version, called Opera&#195;&#167;&#195;&#163;o MX-1, was released in Brazil.

1578;RoadKill;"Description text from the back of the game-box:&#10;&#10;Cross-Country Demolition Racing in the 21st Century (or &quot;Armored Leapfrog&quot; as its adherents refer to it) brings visions of Mad Max in all his infinite glory to your tabletop in an easily played card game format. Each player competes in an armored racer equipped with an assortment of &quot;accessories&quot; not commonly found in your average Auto Parts store. Road hog won't let you pass? No problem&hellip; debate the right of way with a burst of your front machine-guns. Annoyed by that tailgater? &hellip;a few well-timed grenades should scrape him off your bumper. Reckless passer? &hellip;well, if your smoke screen doesn&rsquo;t discourage him, a nudge from your scythe-blade hubcaps should do the job. And these are just the &quot;standard&quot; accessories. In the Advanced Game, you can customize your car into something even James Bond would envy.&#10;&#10;Running low on fuel &hellip; better pull into the next Rest Stop, but beware of sabotage or theft. Only losers nap during RoadKill. Besides, what better time to salt the track with tire spikes or change a road sign or two. Everything goes in Roadkill, an uproarious game of highway combat more vicious than the Santa Monica Freeway.&#10;&#10;Players vie for the lead so they may lay the next section of the course. For example, a player with a Nuclear Fuel Cell will want to lead the others on a merry chase through mountainous terrain to sap their fuel. However, someone already running on fumes will opt for a desert straight-away to finish the race before he must pit and relinquish the lead. But pole position has its price-attracting more than its share of misfortune, while slipstreaming provides opportunities back in the pack.&#10;&#10;As if the players don't heap enough mayhem upon each other, the game throws an endless series of monkey wrenches into play as cars breakdown, the road widens and narrows or comes to a temporary stop in a blizzard, rock slide, or drawbridge (or does it?). You never know what is around the bend in Roadkill.&#10;&#10;";1993;5.9137;2.3947;2;10;90;12;Card Game, Fighting, Racing, Science Fiction

Each player assumes the role of an outlaw clad in Lincoln green and tries to outdo his fellows in amassing the most gold by winning archery contests, recruiting stout yeomen, or robbing wealthy travelers. But beware; the woods are full of the Sheriff's men. Ambushes by Prince John or Sir Guy of Guisbourne could land you in irons in a castle dungeon.&#10;&#10;Play is extremely simple as each player maneuvers his band across the map using playing cards that both dictate the action and define the sequence of play with little or no reference to the rules. Yet, strategy is important. You can opt to stick to the relative safety of the woods and dine on the King's deer or don a disguise to sneak into Nottingham Castle to cudgel the Sheriff himself.&#10;&#10;";1991;5.77419;1.5143;2;5;60;10;Adventure, Fighting
1582;Sicily: Triumph and Folly;"Sicily: Triumph and Folly:  The Campaign to Capture Sicily, 1943, is the 7th game in The Gamers popular OCS (Operational Combat System) series of games, and covers Operation Husky from the invasions to the fall of Messina.&#10;&#10;It breaks ground within the series: the first to use the 2.5 mile per hex scale (instead of the usual 5 mile per hex scale)and the first to cover a major amphibious operation.&#10;&#10;Each turn represents 1/4 of a week instead of 1/2 week. This retains the system wide standard ground movement allowances and movement point costs. Air unit ranges have been doubled (to reflect raw range) as they are not affected by the time scale change. Land units represent Brigades, Regiments, Battalions, Companies &amp; KamfGruppes.&#10;&#10;The game includes a few shorter scenarios plus several different start-dates for the campaign games, based on the various critical events of the campaign. &#10;Playing time can be a couple of hours for the shorter scenarios, but as with all the OCS games the real money is in the various campaigns, which - while quite manageable on the scale of these things - still can take from one to two full weekends to play to completion.&#10;&#10;This is certainly the most rules-intensive of all the OCS games with air, ground, and naval units (including aircraft carriers!), airdrop capability on both sides, and the invasion and naval supply transport rules.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1/4 week&#10;Hex: 2.5 miles / 4 Km&#10;Units: Company to Corps&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;Two 22 x 34&quot; full-color maps&#10;Five dual-side printed countersheets (1,540 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 40-page OCS v2.0i system rules booklet&#10;One 36-page Sicily specific rules booklet&#10;Two OCS Charts &amp; Tables booklets&#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;";2000;7.75517;4.0;2;2;60;16;Wargame, World War II

1588;Bauernschlau;"The theme of this game is building sheep farms. Each farmer (player) owns a farm consisting of hexes radiating out from the center of the board, and whose boundaries (and therefore, sizes) are initially undefined. The placement of fences -- each of which is shared by the two surrounding farms -- defines the boundaries. Some hexes are clearly going to be in certain farms; others will be fought over (either to acquire or avoid!) fiercely.&#10;&#10;The goal is to complete one's own farm by having the fences on both its sides reach the outer edge of the board before the game ends (without which one cannot win), and to have the most enclosed points among all such completed farms (which wins).&#10;&#10;The sheep are on thick cardboard disks, printed on one side with values ranging from 5 (the best) down to -3. One sheep can fit onto each board hex.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player gets to do one of several actions:&#10;&#10;1) place a sheep blindly from the supply face-down onto an empty board space after secretly looking at it; 2) turn up a face-down sheep tile in place (thereby freezing it for the rest of the game); 3) use the cool wooden sheepdog to blindly &quot;herd&quot; a face-down sheep from one hex to another, where it is then flipped up and frozen; or 4) lay a fence piece on either of the two fences surrounding his farm.&#10;&#10;Certain board hexes, symmetrically distributed, act as multipliers for the sheep that ends up in that space.  There are a few special situation rules and a few rules governing fence placement. There are strong elements of bluff and memory in this game.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player's completed farm is filled with pieces (either face-up or down sheep, or the dog). Whoever has the highest number of points on face-up sheep in his/her farm after applying multipliers is the winner.&#10;&#10;";1991;6.0735;1.6;2;6;45;8;Farming, Memory

1600;Russian Roulette;"Each player selects a different doubles and places a marker on the board to signify that it is his. All players then ante one chip to the jackpot. The first player then takes the dice and rolls and continues to roll until he rolls a 7. Each rolled number is kept track of unless a 7 or doubles is rolled.&#10;&#10;If a double is rolled the player who has the double marked adds it to his score and must ante a chip into the jackpot. On a seven the total that the player has rolled is added to his score and a new round is started. If a 7 is rolled by way of a 6 and a 1 the player forfeits his entire score and must ante 1 chip. The first player to achieve a score of 252 or better while it is his turn to roll wins the game and collects the jackpot.&#10;&#10;The rules do not assign any significance to the jackpot so I can only think that it is supposed to be a betting game.

1602;The Royal Game of Ur;"The game has been published under different names but it is a simple race game very much like Backgammon. This edition has a board that is a reproduction of the original found in the Mesopotamian city of Ur. Each player brings their 7 pieces in to play and takes them off of their outer track. Opposing pieces come into conflict on the inner track that they must travel on to the exit. If you land on a space occupied by a single opponent's piece you send it back to the start. If you land on a space occupied by 2 or more opponent's pieces then your piece goes back to the start.&#10;&#10;The four dice give a marked or blank result. They are tetrahedral (four-sided) dice.&#10;&#10;Each die gives a &quot;1&quot; or a &quot;0&quot;. You can roll 0,1,2,3, or 4. Statistically, 2 is most common- a good thing to bear in mind. The rosette in the central track is a &quot;safe&quot; place from which you cannot be bumped, but you can be bumped on others. Landing on any rosette allows you to roll again, but you don't need to move that same piece.&#10;&#10;All moves must be made by one piece only.&#10;&#10;First to bear off all 7 of his pieces wins.&#10;&#10;Note - Rules update in line with guidance from Irving Finkel from British Museum.&#10;&#10;The game may be a relative of Senet and Aseb.&#10;&#10;";-2600;6.2233;1.2453;2;2;30;10;Abstract Strategy, Dice

1610;The Worlds of Boris Vallejo;"From the 30 world tiles (each featuring a different painting by Vallejo) each player, 1 at a time, chooses one and places it so that it touches at least 1 other tile. This is done until each player has placed 5 tiles. This makes up the playing board.&#10;&#10;Each player then receives 8 cards from the card deck. Cards come in 4 flavors. World cards, which are not shuffled into the deck, have info about each world tile. The player who owns that tile takes the card for reference. Character cards have a base strength, class and a home world indicator. They can be played to a tile that you own as defense against attack. If they are played to their home world their strength is doubled. Scroll cards can be placed on worlds and used by characters that can wield magic. These cards boost the base strength. Artifact cards can be used by any character. They boost strength and sometimes have special powers.&#10;&#10;Each player picks a world tile to be his home and places 5 of their 8 cards there to defend it. Players also have a pawn that represents their army.&#10;&#10;During a turn a player first draws 3 cards from the deck.&#10;&#10;Second a player may play up to 2 cards. These cards can be played from his hand to a controlled world, from a controlled world to another controlled world or from a controlled world to his hand.&#10;&#10;Third a player may move his pawn 1 or 2 worlds. If he enters a world controlled by another player he must stop.&#10;&#10;Although not stated in the rules I would assume if a pawn is in a world not claimed by another player he could claim the world and play cards there. If a pawn is in a world occupied by another player you would then have a battle. A battle is fought between the cards on the tile as defense and the cards from the attacking players hand. Calls from allies can be made and other players can contribute to the battles as well.&#10;&#10;The first player to control 8 worlds wins.&#10;&#10;";1984;4.73939;1.8333;1;6;60;12;Adventure, Fantasy, Fighting

1634;Warhammer Quest;"Warhammer Quest is the original game in the Warhammer Quest Series.&#10;&#10;From the Main Rulebook:&#10;&#10;In Warhammer Quest each player takes the role of a warrior, one of four brave adventurers willing to test their courage in the search for wealth and glory. Each hero comes from a different people. The Barbarian has traveled far from the savage north, a land of bitter cold and ferocious warriors. The Wizard hails from the cities of the Empire, the largest and most important of the realms of men. The Dwarf is drawn by the goldlust for which his race is famous. Dwarfs are grim and rather abrupt, but they are good fighters and loyal friends who remember debts of gratitude as readily as debts of coin. The Elf comes from the green woods of Loren where his kin spend their days hunting and making merry, protected from evil by the strange magic of their land. Elves are incredibly quick and agile, and they are also the best archers in the world.&#10;&#10;In the Warhammer Quest game the players enter a dark and forbidding dungeon. Together they must face the horrific dangers that wait for them. They will be attacked by monsters such as Orcs, Goblins, Skaven and Minotaurs. Other perils lurk in the darkness: scurrying venomous things like spiders, deadly pit traps, and decayed tunnels that cave in at the slightest touch. If they complete their quest the players will be rewarded with gold, treasure and artefacts of magical power. The more gold and treasure you can discover the better.., and the player whose warrior amasses the greatest fortune has done best of all!&#10;&#10;Warhammer Quest is probably unlike other games you have played. Rather than each player competing against the others, all the players must co-operate if they are to win. Also, there is no single board. Instead, the different rooms and corridor sections are clipped together to make a dungeon that is different every time you play. The game rules may seem a little complex at first - but don't worry a lot of the rules are designed to extend the game and are not vital to begin with. The actual game rules you need to play are in this book or printed on the various cards. The hugely thick Role-play Book is all extra and alternative material that introduces you to a whole new hobby of role-playing Warhammer Quest.&#10;&#10;- Warhammer Quest Contents -&#10;&#10;    4 Warrior models: Barbarian, Dwarf, Elf and Wizard&#10;    6 Orc Warrior models&#10;    6 Orc Archer models&#10;    6 Goblin Spearmen models&#10;    6 Night Goblin Archer models&#10;    12 Skaven models&#10;    3 Minotaur models&#10;    12 Giant Spider models&#10;    12 Giant Bat models&#10;    12 Giant Rat models&#10;    12 Snotling models&#10;    10 Dungeon Doorways&#10;    32 Page Rule Book&#10;    16 Page Adventure Book&#10;    192 Page Role-play Book&#10;    1 How to Play sheet&#10;    50 Page Adventure Record Pad&#10;    19 Event Cards&#10;    23 Dungeon Cards&#10;    30 Treasure Cards&#10;    17 Blank Event Cards&#10;    15 Spell Cards&#10;    4 Warrior Cards&#10;    4 Battle-level Cards&#10;    4 Equipment Cards&#10;    4 Warrior Counters&#10;    6 Dungeon Rooms&#10;    5 Objective Rooms&#10;    7 Corridors&#10;    1 Steps&#10;    3 T-junctions&#10;    1 Corner&#10;    1 Portcullis Marker&#10;    1 Cave-in Marker&#10;    3 Pit of Despair Markers&#10;    6 Webbed Counters&#10;    15 Power Tokens&#10;    10 Luck Counters&#10;    24 plastic shields&#10;    18 Scenery Markers&#10;    6 Large Dice &amp; 12 Small Dice&#10;&#10;&#10;";1995;7.50746;2.6901;1;4;120;12;Adventure, Exploration, Fantasy, Fighting, Miniatures
1636;The Quest of the Philosopher's Stone;"A unique game that combines strategy with puzzle solving.  Players or teams move their pawn around the board trying to gain two wisdom cards for each of the four territories.  Wisdom cards are earned by correctly answering brain teaser questions from the Book of Challenges.  Wisdom cards, in turn, allow a player to obtain an alphabetical clue for that territory.  The four alphabetical clues, correctly unscrambled, form a word related to the medieval theme of the game.  The first player to correctly decipher the word wins the game.  The board also contains areas to help the players move around the board and/or interfere with the progress of their opponents.&#10;&#10;";1986;5.47778;2.3333;2;8;120;8;Deduction, Fantasy, Medieval, Puzzle
1638;Archimedes;"A completely different game from the &quot;Archimedes&quot; published in 1995 by egSpiele. The game is played on an 8x8 board, with each player controlling one King pawn. On your turn, you must move your King (as a normal chess king) and then place a pyramid on the board. Once your King has become completely surrounded by pyramids and cannot move, you are out of the game, unless there are two pyramids of the same color (there are eight pyramids in five different colors) leading out in a straight line from your King, in which case you can move the one closest to your King to anywhere else on the board, and then move your King into the empty space.&#10;&#10;Oddly, the box this game came in is completely devoid of any extraneous info (including game designer and year of publication), and even the manufacturer's initials are in tiny print with a &copy; symbol, crammed down in the corner of the cover. Even the rules for the game are printed on the back of the box (in English &amp; German) as opposed to being included on a separate sheet inside.&#10;&#10;";1981;4.88571;2.1429;2;4;30;8;Abstract Strategy
1640;Blockbusters;"Based on the American TV show that ran from 1980-1982 (along with a brief return in 1987), and from 1983 in Europe with greater success. Played over a 20-hex game board, two teams (one having one more teammate than the other) compete to answer questions with the initials given (What E holds sandcastles together?  Electricity) and place their mark.  The team to connect top-to-bottom or side-to-side wins the game.&#10;&#10;";1982;5.43824;1.2857;3;6;30;10;Movies / TV / Radio theme, Trivia
1644;Tipp-Kick;"Two player soccer game using metal miniatures.  Players each have 1 field player and 1 goalie, and use a 14-sided black and white &quot;ball&quot; that determines the possession.&#10;&#10;The colour on the top of the ball determines who is next to kick. The kicker puts the field player next to the ball and releases its leg to kick the ball. The other player should try to block the kick with his or her goal keeper. After the kick the possession is once more decided and the same procedure starts all over again.&#10;&#10;";1921;6.52594;1.2245;2;2;10;8;Action / Dexterity, Miniatures, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Sports

1648;Kan-U-Go;"An old crossword card game from the 30s, I was given my copy of Kan-U-Go in 1975. It has small cards with letters and values, and simple rules for playing and scoring. But the cards aren't small enough and the game soon fills a table. Not bad, but it's obvious why Scrabble sells.&#10;&#10;Copyright September 10th, 1934 by T.G. Porter (Printers) Ltd., Leeds 9. My version has 58 letter cards plus two Kan-u-go wild cards ... my search of the internet shows no consistency in the number of cards quoted for this game (I have found quotes of 52 to 58), and in fact several used game sellers (who should know better) failed to quote any number of cards.&#10;&#10;My version of the game is for 1 to 7 players, as there are rules for a solitaire version, entitled &quot;KAN-U-GO -- ALONE&quot; (Crossword Patience).&#10;&#10;Unlike the version whose pictures appear in this file, my rulesbook is slightly different, it is not nor ever has been glued to the box top, the cards have blue backs of the same design as shown, and the box has a pseudo-marbelled finish in peach and gold.&#10;&#10;";1934;4.85;1.5;2;7;30;10;Card Game, Word Game
1650;The Lord of the Rings Adventure Game;"Milton Bradley marketed this game as a tie-in with Ralph Bakshi's &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; animated feature film. However, aside from the artwork and the piece names, the game only bears a superficial resemblance to either the movie or Tolkien's works.&#10;&#10;Each player chooses a character from the Fellowship. The object of the game is to have that character cast a magic Ring into Mount Doom. Along the way from the Shire to their final destination, players have opportunities to pick up *several* Rings. These rings may be spent to get past opposing creatures. However, to win the game, a player must have at least one Ring when they reach Mount Doom.&#10;&#10;Cards allow a player to move 1-3 clear spaces ahead, to defeat Orcs or Nazgul, to bypass the various opposing creatures on the board, or to traverse mountain terrain, dictate movement. Cards are also useful for stealing rings from an opponent, relocating Nazgul on the board, and other functions. Each player has a hand of 5 cards with which to play the game.&#10;&#10;Die rolling comes into play for fighting Orcs, Nazgul, Shelob and Gollum when you don't have a card to defeat (or escape from) them, or to traverse the mountains. A special die tells players how many turns they will be bogged down in a mountain space once they enter it.&#10;&#10;Card and Ring management afford strategy opportunities, while the rules remain simple enough (and the game quick enough) to allow the game to be played by a wide variety of ages. Despite its divergence from the main story, the game itself offers a measure of challenge that makes it enjoyable - far more so than it would have been as a simple &quot;roll-and-move&quot; game with a strict adherence to the movie or book theme.&#10;&#10;";1978;6.14805;1.9;2;4;45;10;Adventure, Fantasy, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Novel-based
1652;Escape from the Casbah;"&quot;The game of Intrigue and Pursuit&quot;&#10;Agents from every corner of the globe compete for possession of the priceless jewels that lie within the Casbah.&#10;&#10;Imagine a black-and-white film noir &agrave; la Casablanca.  That's the atmosphere.  The Casbah is a maze of tortuous passages including narrow one-ways and barred gates.  The police patrols it, but that won't stop us international spies/thieves, will it?  You wander the Casbah, grab the precious stones and bring them back out.  Running will get you there faster --but it tips off the police!&#10;Each player has one rule he may disregard.  All players may move the police tokens.&#10;&#10;A decent game that suffers from crude components.&#10;&#10;";1975;6.625;0.0;2;6;90;10;Arabian, Spies / Secret Agents

Cards help you, hinder you, or allow you to hinder your opponents.&#10;&#10;";1988;5.5545;1.2857;2;6;60;8;Economic, Trains
1656;Smokers Wild;"In this anti-smoking game, the players try to accumulate money while avoiding addiction to cigarettes.  At the start of the game, each player picks a profession likely to benefit from the smoking of others (Doctor, Undertaker, etc.) and then starts moving around the board.  If a player lands on an advertising space, there's a chance that he or she will begin smoking.  When a smoker ends up sharing a space with another player, there's a chance he'll pawn one of his brand habits to him.  The more a player smokes, the faster they advance on the Life-O-Metre, which ends with death.  The game ends once the first player dies (in the short game) or when only one player remains alive (in the longer game).&#10;&#10;The game is extremely simple to play and is filled with all kinds of horrible (but sometimes amusing) puns.  The game's claim that it has the power to cause smokers to quit and to discourage people from ever picking up the habit is rather questionable, but since it's easy enough to be played by young children, its anti-smoking message might actually be able to reach an audience that hasn't heard it all before.  Unfortunately, the game's simplicity may well work against it; for some players, once all the jokes have been heard (and there aren't all that many), there's really not much reason left to play the game.  On the plus side, there's a lot of player interaction as your profession gets called upon or when you pass your cigarettes to another.&#10;&#10;Smokers Wild seems related to Drinkers Wild so it may have been originally published by Gamma Two.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    Drinkers Wild&#10;    Lovers Wild&#10;&#10;&#10;";1978;4.99881;1.1818;2;6;120;8;Humor
1658;Police State;"&quot;A game of strategy, survival, power and wealth&quot;&#10;&#10;This is a sort of &quot;communist Monopoly&quot;.  The players go around the board, but which leg of the board they're allowed on depends on how far they've risen in the hierarchy yet.  The most visible status symbol is your apartment size --and the competition for the one and only full-size Dacha can be ferocious.  There are a number of other status perks, such as use of the State Car.  All in all, a very amusing game that actually does capture a fair amount of the flavour of life in the communist USSR before its fall.&#10;&#10;The game was invented by Harley Sachs in 1969 under the name POLICE STATE, and sold in England and the USA, even as far as Ireland and South America.  It was copyrighted, patented, and published by the IDEA DEVELOPMENT COMPANY (IDEVCO), licensed by Gameophiles and later by the L.A. Producers' Partnership under the name COMRADES.&#10;&#10;It got his second name COMRADES from a BBC documentary series (1983-84), which aired in 1986 in the US. The documentary was about the life of ordinary Soviet citizens, which got interviewed by the producer Richard Denton.&#10;&#10;";1976;5.3;1.0;2;8;120;10;Humor, Political
1660;The Cattlemen;"&quot;An exciting land-grabbing, claim-jumping game of the Old West, pitting one land baron against another&quot;&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to take over all the land and industries in the Old West.&#10;&#10;The map is divided into &quot;claims&quot;, which are states (or parts of states) grouped into various industries (timber, gold, oil, farming, cattle...) or railroad spurs.  There are 32 claims in all.&#10;In the first phase of play, each player stakes one claim (including claims already staked by that player or another one), until all claims have at least one stake on them.  After that, each player collects money based on any one claim he owns, and uses that money to reinforce his existing claim(s) or to jump another player's claim.  This process continues until one player has forced all other off the board.&#10;&#10;";1977;3.98444;2.0;2;4;60;10;American West, Economic, Negotiation
1662;Napoléon: The Waterloo Campaign, 1815;"On June 18, 1815, one of the most decisive battles in military history was fought in Belgian fields twenty miles southeast of Brussels. Within a short 100 days, Napoleon, former emperor of France, had returned from exile on the island of Elba, again seized power, quickly assembled an army, and marched to defeat the dispersed British and Prussian armies now preparing to invade France.&#10;&#10;Napoleon invaded Belgium on June 15th, defeated the Prussians at the Battle of Ligny on the 16th and after a day of pursuit, faced the British and Dutch army commanded by Wellington. Aided by superb defensive tactics and the timely arrival of Prussian reinforcements, Wellington defeated the French in the great Battle of Waterloo, ending forever the military ambitions of the great Napoleon.&#10;&#10;Highlights:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Mapboard which is a color map of southern Belgium. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Wooden Blocks as counters provide step-reduction and fog of war with no muss or fuss &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Two or three player game - Napoleon can be played by two or three players. With three, the allied side has two players, one British and one Prussian, and some special rules apply. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Note that there are essentially three different versions of the game which means that the rules are somewhat different. Key Differences in the various editions:&#10;         1st and 2nd edition had 48 blocks--shorter (60+ min.) play time -- vs.-- 3rd edition has 84 blocks--more accurate division level&#10;          3rd edition had Bl&uuml;cher, Napoleon, and Wellington leader blocks that give slight combat and movement bonuses. Although units have increased nearly two fold, the 3rd edition map remains same size, leading to overcrowding.&#10;          4th edition has 56 blocks and a larger map - play time is usually 90 minutes or less.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;";1974;7.37284;2.4699;2;3;120;12;Napoleonic, Wargame

1678;The Peloponnesian War, 431-404 BC;"The Peloponnesian War lets you chart the destiny of the war. This strategic wargame of ancient warfare allows the player, with a unique new solitaire system, to try an accomplish a lasting peace. All existing solitaire systems on the market have the player take one side for the entire game. Unfortunately this pits the player against a random system with poor strategic direction. In The Peloponnesian War you get to play both sides, pitting yourself against the best you can offer. If the game system is winning, the player is forced to continue with the losing side. Success, on the other hand, will eventually force the player to change sides and recover the losing side's fortunes. The duration of the war and the player's performance determine victory. In this manner the player competes against himself in the classic tradition of the Greek tragedy.&#10;&#10;";1991;6.76532;3.127;1;2;120;12;Ancient, Wargame

1682;The Challenge;"&#239;&#187;&#191;The Challenge is a card game of deadly combat and formidable magics. (It is clearly a knockoff of Mayfair's Encounters, though it never mentions that fact.) Action is fast paced and tension-filled as characters exchange blows, fire spells, and even attempt to backstab. It is the fantasy battle at its best. &#10;More than simply hack and slash, strategy IS the key to victory, with cunning and skill playmg a central role in your success. Game play is an exercise in diplomacy and subterfuge, as &#239;&#187;&#191;treaties and trickery can make all the difference between victory and defeat. &#10;While The Challenge is easy to learn (start playing in less than 15 minutes), it has a depth far beyond that of the typical card game. With its excitment filled, strategy oriented, fullthrottled action, The Challenge is sure to become a classic. If you always loved combat the best ... take The Challenge.&#10;&#10;Sequence of Play:&#10;&#10;The player who rolled the high die goes first. Play moves clockwise around the table. The player can either challenge an opponent, pass, or declare a defensive turn.&#10;&#10;&#239;&#187;&#191;1) Challenge another character by using a Weapon Action Card, casting a spell (Advanced), using a magic item (Advanced) or using a thief skill (Advanced) from one of your characters against another character in another party. Both Character Cards involved are turned face-up (if they are not already). Then the defending player may retaliate with any appropriate card or pass. The challenging player may then continue by playing an appropriate Action Card or passing, followed by the defending player, etc., until both players have passed or one of the two characters involved in the challenge has died. After the challenge is resolved, the player whose tum it is can move one of his characters from one rank to another, discard any number of Action Cards, and draw from the Action Deck(s) until he has seven cards. The player that was defending in the challenge cannot discard, but can refill his hand up to seven. It is then the next player's tum.&#10;&#10;&#239;&#187;&#191;2) Pass - Do no actions, moving of characters, or discarding of cards.&#10;&#10;&#239;&#187;&#191;3) Defensive turn - You can't play any Action Card that directly affects another party. Play party Defensive Cards (Advanced), allocate Magic Cards (Advanced) to characters, move any number of characters from one rank to another, discard any number of Action Cards, and draw up to seven cards from either the Weapon Action deck or the Mystic Action deck (Advanced). Remember, you can't do two defensive turns back-to- back.&#10;&#10;";1990;5.80704;1.4286;2;6;60;12;Card Game, Fantasy, Fighting, Medieval
1684;Intern;"&quot;Now YOU are the physician!&quot;&#10;&#10;Each player is an intern competitively trying to admit patients, diagnose them correctly, treat them -or send them to your colleagues of different Specialties if you can- and then discharge them from the hospital.  &#10;Instead of money, the interns try to collect hours of sleep (worth much more than any money while being a Resident / Intern in the hospital, every Doctor will understand :-).  &#10;un and very relaxing, surprisingly realistic and interesting, specially if you are in the medical field, amusing for others.

1686;Spy vs Spy;"The object of the game is to build tunnels to bombs and bring them back to your home base.&#10;&#10;The bombs have various effects hidden on their base.  The tunnels are built through tile laying, so each player (best played with four) digs furiously from his manhole in the corner towards the bombs, hoping to reach 'em first.  If you connect tunnels, then you'll be able to try to steal another player's bomb before he brings it home.&#10;The basic turn goes like this:&#10;First, you move your pawn to another tunnel tile.&#10;Second, if you ended up or started on a bomb, test (with a special die) to see if it blows up.&#10;Third, draw a tunnel tile (you have a hand of four) and play one.&#10;Finally, if you get a bomb home safely, read its message.&#10;In addition to the tunnel tiles, there are white, black and grey spy tiles.  They are used to block tunnel tiles (each tunnel tile has a little black or white spy drawn in its middle, so you can play a White Spy only on black tunnel tiles and vice-versa; the Grey Spy can be played on either).&#10;Spy vs Spy is not be to be confused with Spion & Spion, an entirely different game by the same publisher and credited to Alex Randolph .&#10;&#10;";1986;5.62533;1.4286;2;4;90;10;Comic Book / Strip, Fighting, Maze
1688;Star Commander;"&quot;Star Commander is a fast paced game of galactic domination for two to five players.  Each player (Star Commander) attempts to construct a battle fleet of space ships while preventing by any means, fair or foul, the other commanders from building theirs.  To create a fleet and keep it requires careful strategy, bold battle tactics, and rapid assessment of opportunities as they present themselves.  All the techniques of power politics, bluffs, battles, and sabotage come into play as you expand your command to interstellar supremacy.  Good luck!&quot;&#10;&#10;";1983;6.3;1.0;2;5;90;8;Card Game, Fighting, Science Fiction
1690;Unexploded Cow;"Europe. Summer 1997. You and your most creative friends have discovered two problems with a common solution: mad cows in England and unexploded bombs in France. You've decided to bring these two powder kegs together just to see what happens &ndash; and you wouldn't say &quot;no&quot; to a little money on the side, so round up your herd, march them through France, and set them loose behind the Cordon Rouge. If you're lucky, you'll come home rich before Greenpeace gets hold of you.&#10;&#10;Either way, there's something magical about blowing up cows.&#10;&#10;Unexploded Cow is a money game in which players are trying to collect enough points to win the pot. On every turn, you will buy cows and pay for special effects by putting money in the pot, then try to discover bombs with your own cows in an effort to take money out of the pot. All along, you will be earning points from the French as you liberate town after town from the terrors of unexploded bombs, and the player who scores the most points gets whatever's left in the pot.&#10;&#10;Unexploded Cow is best played as a series of short games, each of which takes about thirty minutes. The game is quite simple and very chaotic: You'll have a blast.&#10;&#10;";2001;6.07943;1.3618;2;6;25;12;Animals, Card Game, Economic, Humor, Print & Play
1692;Spoons;"You pull from a regular deck of cards 4 of a kind for each person playing. Shuffle those all together and deal them out so each person has 4 cards. They can't look at them until the game starts though. Place spoons on the table (enough for all except one player). Position them fairly, so each person pretty much has the same chance to grab one. You have one person (this job rotates hand to hand) start calling out 'pass'. How you pass is to select one card from your hand, put it on the table face down next to the person on your right, then you pick up the card the person on your left put down. You keep doing this until 1) you get 4 of a kind or 2) someone else gets four of a kind. At this point you grab a spoon, and the person who doesn't get a spoon gets a 'pig' point. Once you get 3 pig points you are a hog. If you are a hog you have lost, but you can still be part of the game. Hogs can talk to game players, but if a game player talks to a hog they get a pig point. Of course the winner is the person left when everyone else is a hog.&#10;&#10;";1972;5.18903;1.0833;4;13;30;8;Action / Dexterity, Animals, Card Game, Children's Game, Real-time
1694;Little Round Top: The South's Best Chance at Gettysburg;"The battle of Gettysburg was a huge struggle that locked armies of the North and South in three July days of bitter warfare which turned the tide of the Civil War against the Confederacy. Among the many small actions that made up this battle none was more important than the fight for Little Round Top, a rocky forested hill on which rested the extreme left flank of the Union line. It was here that the outnumbered 20th Maine regiment held off repeated Confederate assaults, turning back the South's best chance to win this battle which they could not afford to lose.&#10;&#10;Little Round Top is Avalon Hill's new game for two players which re-creates this critical battle. During a typical game turn, both players move their company sized forces over a map of the battle area, positioning them for rifle fire and bayonet charges. Fire and melee combat are resolved by a die roll on the appropriate Combat Results Table. Regimental officers and their command abilities are crucial for keeping the attack moving forward or the defense intact.&#10;&#10;Little Round Top comes complete with a colorful map of the battlefield, 100 cardboard playing pieces, and a short rules booklet.&#10;&#10;Playing time: 2 1/2 hours&#10;&#10;Complexity rating (from 1-10, 10 the highest): 4&#10;&#10;";1979;6.44866;2.6333;2;2;150;12;American Civil War, Wargame

1704;Attacke;"A game of strategy with bluff and tactics for 2-4 players whose object is to eliminate all other players.&#10;&#10;At first glance, this is a Risk knock-off. A closer look reveals a different game.&#10;&#10;For starters, each of the 42 lands can only be occupied by a single token, which act more as visual aids than as armies per se. Combat is card--driven, each player playing from a hand of five cards. There are Artillery, Cavalry and Infantry cards, of various values; you're allowed to play up to one of each kind when attacking or defending. Joker cards can substitute for any given type. You can play your entire hand of five cards if you wish, but you only draw two per turn, so this could leave you exposed.&#10;&#10;Treason cards allow you to take over a non-contiguous land; Desertion cards allow you to get army cards from another player. The Revolution cards are very powerful as they will take over an entire continent! Luckily, there are Counter-Revolution cards in the deck as defense.&#10;&#10;A refreshing change from Risk, and certainly playable in a lot less time.&#10;&#10;";1977;6.0;0.0;2;4;45;8;Bluffing, Wargame
1706;UFO: Game of Close Encounters;"UFO: Game of Close Encounters is a low complexity Tactical level board-wargame themed on an Alien invasion of Earth.  The Alien player must land 5 of 8 available ships on Earth to win.  The Earth player, with only eight rockets, must defend or perish.  Movement is along orbital paths that form 7 concentric rings around the Earth.  Each player rolls two dice and moves one rocket or UFO the exact count of for each die.  In addition to the UFOs and Earth's rockets speeding around, the moon orbits the Earth destroying all in its path.  Combat is not dice based, rather players capture opponents pieces by landing on them by exact orbital move of one die.&#10;&#10;The advanced game adds dummy counters for the alien player and space stations for additional defence of Earth.&#10;&#10;It feels really more like an abstract strategy game, but Avalon Hill classified as a wargame simulation.&#10;&#10;The game consists of&#10;&#10;-two 8&quot; x 16&quot; map boards with 2 black plastic clips to hold together.&#10;-die cut counters (8 rockets, 5 space stations, 1 moon, 8 saucers, 12 decoy UFOs)&#10;-2 six sided dice &#10;-1 double sided page of rules.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 1&#10;&#10;";1976;5.12331;1.6667;2;2;30;12;Science Fiction, Wargame

1710;The Siege of Jerusalem (Third Edition);"Published by Avalon Hill in 1989 (for the Third edition).&#10;&#10;(from MMP's web site:)&#10;&#10;It is 70 A.D.  Dawn breaks on the combined might of four Legions arrayed on the heights of Mount Scopus, starting their methodical advance across the valley to the ancient walled city of Jerusalem.  Siege lines have been secured tight about the city.  There is no hope of escape.  The besieged must persist behind their stout walls or perish before a vengeful Rome.  Five grueling years of campaigning in Judea is now culminating in the Siege of Jerusalem.&#10;&#10;But the fortified city defies even the might of Rome.  The thick walls atop the steep slopes literally bristle with natural and manmade fortifications.  It will take all of Rome's considerable engineering skills to winch their war machines into position for an assault up the slopes to the city.  Only here in the north plain can the city's walls be taken by escalade.  The rhythmic approach of the Legions is muted by the rumble of the siege engines as an assortment of towers, rams, and artillery precede the maniples.  The distant walls seethe with the frenzied activity of an alerted populace as the antagonists draw near.  This majestic view is abruptly halted by the blare of trumpets which soon gives way to the cacophony of the clash of arms and screams of the dying.&#10;&#10;Morning turns to dusk before the walls are breached and the weary legions exact their vengeance.  The sky turns bright again, aglow in the reflection of a thousand fires as the northern outskirts burn.  But what price victory?  Another day such as this will break the Roman Army and only one of the city's ten walled sections has fallen this day.  They will have to find another way.  Shafts must be dug to undermine the walls or earthen ramps built with which to scale them.  It will be a long campaign.&#10;&#10;This is The Siege of Jerusalem...An epic battle simulation with all the trappings and majesty of a Cecil B. DeMille film spectacular.  Facing the greatest army of antiquity, the Judeans must rely on the stoutness of their walls to halt the unbeatable Roman legions and therein lies the fascination:  the immovable object vs the unstoppable force.  As Eliezar Ben Yair, leader of the Zealots, you must conduct a skilled defense of the city's ever shrinking perimeter - exacting from the Romans a price so terrible that they will be forced to lift their siege - or break out to continue your struggle for freedom at Massada.  As Titus, commander of the Roman army, you must decide when, where and how to renew the assault - gauging your troop needs against the progress of your siege works and the press of time caused by outside threats.  More than just conducting tactical combat, the Roman must formulate an overall strategic plan for the conduct of the siege.&#10;&#10;Vastly revised from its 1st &amp; 2nd edition printing from Historical Perspectives in the 70's, Siege of Jerusalem now boasts two-sided counters, a continuous combat system, a strategic interphase for conducting the entire siege, and the morale / panic rules so important in portraying ancient warfare.  An Introductory Scenario depicting the abortive assault of Gallus with the XII Legion three years previous allows players to learn how to handle a legion in a single day's play while training for eventual participation in the conduct of the epic siege.&#10;&#10;";1989;7.14477;3.881;2;2;300;12;Ancient, Wargame
1712;Showbiz;"In the game, players take on the roles of theatre managers and must hire performers that will bring in the most money from the public.  There are six different styles of performers, and at different times in the game, public opinion will favour different styles.  Public preference is determined by dealing out cards from a special deck.  The current opinion is always known, and a possible (but not necessarily accurate) forecast of future preferences is also provided.&#10;&#10;Each turn, public opinion changes (sometimes to match the forecast, and sometimes into something completely random), then players use a bidding system to acquire contracts with performers.  Once contracts have been negotiated, profit is calculated depending on how well performers match the public's desires.&#10;&#10;By the time twelve turns have been played (and possibly one or two turns sooner), the game will come to an end and the player with the highest score is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;The game was originally published by the designer in 1984 (or earlier).  Hexagames published a German edition (which is the only one that handles up to 8 players) in 1988.

1714;Moonstar;"First was published 'Corona' (1974). Moonstar (1981) added planets and variants&#10;(variant number 8 is Corona, without sand timer). &#10;'Harun' (1984) is not new game, it is a rethemed copy of Moonstar! &#10;'Orbit' (1993) a new variation including the Corona variations &amp; Harun.&#10;Finally, Randolph recycled most of the game into his 'Rasende Roboter' ('Ricochet Robots') (1999) , although the course mechanism and the objective were completely changed.&#10;&#10;Quite possibly the first &quot;German&quot; game to cross the Atlantic...&#10;&#10;About the game (from the back of the box)&#10;&#10;Moonstar is a game unlike any other game for any number of people. All the action is governed by dice, yet there is no luck involved. The dice simply establish the situation. It is up to the players to act upon it. A game with endless variety.&#10;&#10;Playable by any number of people, from one to a hundred, Moonstar combines numbers calculations, memory, and quick-thinking into a fast-playing, action-packed, exciting contest of pure skill.&#10;&#10;The board represents the twelve constellations (stars) of the Zodiac and the playing pieces represent moons and planets. Each game consists of a number of rounds of play. In each round, the board and playing pieces are first setup by one of the players. Then the dice are thrown. A one-minute auction period begins. Each player may bid any number of times in the auction or not at all. Each bid, however, must be higher than the previous one. When the one-minute runs out, the highest bidder plays that round.&#10;&#10;The play of the round also lasts one minute. A player plays a round by placing one die on each moon on the, board and then moving that moon (and die) a number of stars equal to the number of the die. The die is then removed and the moon may not be moved again. This procedure is followed for each moon. The player must move each moon before the time runs out, or those moons which have not been moved may not move.&#10;&#10;The player's score is then totaled to see if he has made his bid, by scoring a number of points for each moon, depending on which stars and planets they have landed on, If a player makes his bid, he scores a number of points equal to his bid. If he fails, he scores nothing. Rounds are setup and played in this manner until one player has scored enough points to win.&#10;&#10;But this is only the beginning. Moonstar is actually twelve games in one. Game One is simply the Basic Game. Games Two-Twelve each change one or more parts of Game One, or add something to it. They introduce things like challenging bids, side bets, more moons, more dice, different planet values, no planets. and advanced scoring methods.&#10;&#10;Includes:&#10;&#10;    16&quot; x 16&quot; gameboard&#10;    15 moon pieces&#10;    21 planet pieces&#10;    1 minute sand timer&#10;    11 6-sided dice&#10;    rulebook&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Corona&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Orbit&#10;    Ricochet Robots&#10;&#10;&#10;";1981;5.18096;1.75;2;12;30;12;Abstract Strategy, Dice
1716;Knights of the Air;"[From the back of the Avalon Hill game box]&#10;&#10;They were a part of Europe's &ldquo;next Generation&rdquo;, asked to march to war before they had tasted of life's joys and sorrows.&#10;&#10;They were cut from a special cloth, singled out to do a job that demanded intelligence, endurance, steadiness and coordination of the highest order.&#10;&#10;They dueled to the death in fragile machines, only just invented ten years before, miles above the earth.&#10;&#10;They were brave soldiers to their comrades in arms and heroes to their public.&#10;&#10;They were the fighter pilots of the Great War &ndash; THE KNIGHTS OF THE AIR.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill's game, KNIGHTS OF THE AIR, recreates the deadly combat of the World War I air war.  You learn to fly the great airplanes of the period much in the same way the Aces did &ndash; rig in the cockpit using control stick, throttle and rudder pedals.  Each kind of warplane included in the game has been carefully researched to present the same strengths, weaknesses and idiosyncrasies it demonstrated in real life.  Once you have learned the tricks of your aircraft, you can dare to risk all in a dogfight.  Air combat is conducted in a series of maneuvers as each pilot tries to position his plane for the killing run.  With experience, new and more complicated maneuvers become available so that the ace can barrel roll and loop rings around the novice.  Your success will depend upon your ability to master your plane and to exploit the weaknesses of your enemy's.&#10;&#10;Some Features:&#10;- Your Abilities to improve with experience, An Ace can react quicker, aim his gunfire more accurately, and undertake more complicated maneuvers than a novice can.&#10;&#10;- Each kind of airplane in the game has been designed to perform just like its real-life counterpart.  Rates of climb and dive, maximum and stall speeds, and turning abilities all compare favorably with test flight results.&#10;&#10;-You guide your airplane on the gameboard using real controls.  You adjust speed with the control stick and the rates of dive and climb with the throttle.&#10;&#10;- Special attention was directed, during the design, to develop a simple method of allowing one plane to tail another.  The reflexes of both airplane and pilot are a crucial factor in this procedure.&#10;&#10;- With the wide choice of airplanes included, a practically unlimited variety of dogfights may be staged.  Many of the greatest warplanes are there the Sopwith Camel, SE 5a, SPAD, Nieuport, Bristol Fighter, Fokker Triplane, Fokker DVII, Albatros, Pfalz, Roland and more.&#10;&#10;- Special solitaire scenarios have been created to restage attacks against Zeppelin airships and two-seater warplanes.&#10;&#10;Complexity: Medium&#10;Solitaire Suitability: High&#10;&#10;Each game contains:&#10;- A 22&rdquo;x32&rdquo; full-color gameboard depicting a section of trenchline on the Western Front.

1718;Foreign Exchange;"From the back of the box:&#10;&#10;At last - a money game for adults!&#10;&#10;Be forewarned!  This game might not be for you...unless you are a student of the international money market.  Or, you are just plain curious as to why the US dollar is worth less and less despite the fact that we are still the strongest nation in the world.&#10;&#10;Simply put, Foreign Exchange is not a toy.&#10;&#10;A perfect simulation of the international currency situation, it is!&#10;&#10;International companies realize gains and losses when changing currency rates alter the value of their income and assets in foreign countries.  This game simulates this situation by letting players own and manage multi-national companies in various cities throughout the world.  As in the real world, changing conditions require each player to make constant decisions after considering his company's financial resources - and what he expects his opponents to make - against the cost of alternative protective strategies.&#10;&#10;The Iranian oil situation of early '79 is a classic real-life example.  Iran furnishes less than 7% of America's petroleum needs.  Yet its unavailability has done more to devalue the dollar against gold than any economic crises since the depression of 1939. Why so, you may ask.&#10;&#10;Playing Foreign Exchange will give you insight into this question, and you'll have fun doing so because the game focuses on the interplayer relationships.  Without such interplay relationships, no game is fun to play.  With it, Foreign Exchange might just be the greatest money game to come along since Monopoly.&#10;&#10;Ironically, it doesn't come with any money.  All financial transactions are recorded on a variety of accounting pads included.  If you're into pencils, you'll love this game (some enterprising money -market enthusiasts have already programmed this game on computer).&#10;&#10;You - as company head - decide where in the world (literally) you want to establish sales and manufacturing offices.  This is done at the beginning through a round of trading City Cards among players until everyone is satisfied they've outsmarted their opponents.&#10;&#10;From this point on, a variety of situations and happenstances will determine likely changes in currency rates.  You - the manufacturer - must plan the strategies you think best to maximize gains.&#10;&#10;Foreign Exchange was designed by a professional money-management expert and executive officer of the leading financial institution.  What is duck soup to him, however, might be unfathomable to the novice.  That's why the game comes in three versions: a &quot;Beginning&quot; version for game buffs intrigued by money games; the &quot;Intermediate&quot; game for those with a cursory knowledge of what's going on with foreign currency; and the &quot;Expert&quot; game for those people who really have a yen for this sort of thing.&#10;&#10;Includes:&#10;2-piece fold-out game board&#10;Foreign Exchange Worksheet pad&#10;Net Worth Worksheet pad&#10;Hedging Cost Worksheet pad&#10;24 City Cards&#10;4 Borrowing Cost cards&#10;16 Currency Exchange cards&#10;16 Risk cards&#10;5 player tokens&#10;40 colored markers for 4 different colors&#10;2 6-sided dice&#10;Rules&#10;&#10;";1978;4.4025;2.7;2;4;60;12;Economic

Eventually, Greg published a wargame based on his world called White Bear and Red Moon. In fact, Chaosium was founded to allow Stafford to publish this boardgame! This game later became the excellent Dragon Pass game. White Bear and Red Moon was enough of a hit to spawn a second war game, Nomad Gods, and, more importantly, inspired some D&amp;D fans to write a gaming system that would allow role-playing in Glorantha. Thus was RuneQuest born.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    White Bear & Red Moon&#10;&#10;&#10;";1980;6.99075;3.4426;2;3;120;12;Fantasy, Wargame

1724;Bureaucracy;"From the back of the box&#10;&#10;Bureaucracy is a somewhat less complicated version of The Great Chain of Being, a medieval, theological, parlor game, first uncovered in a small church in Urbino during the renovation of an ancient, holy, but clearly inadequate, sewage system.  Both the Church and the monastic Parkover Brothels deny the authenticity of the game.  As one official noted, &quot;that's a crock&quot;.&#10;&#10;Bureaucracy is designed to simulate the bureaucratic behavior which constitutes so much of what we call government.  It is convoluted, Byzantine, and entertaining.  It is also cost effective, feasible, and administratively impossible.  In its early stages, Bureaucracy required a fifteen story parlor, a six acre gameboard, 200,000 pieces, and a 15,000 page rulebook.  Of course, this prototype was unwieldy.  Consequently, we were forced to simplify the game.  The present version is good for two to eight players.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game at the lowest organizational level.  The winner is the player who rises up through the masses to become the Director of the Bureaucracy.&#10;&#10;Players may select one of four lifestyles, each with its own advantages and disadvantages: lifer, over achiever, empire builder, or hustler.

1730;Trap the Cap;"An age-old children's game, for which multiple variants exist.  Multiple editors and editions.&#10;&#10;In the common version of the game, players roll the dice to move their &quot;caps&quot; around the board.  If a player lands on another cap or a stack of caps, that player captures the stack by nesting his or her cap on top of the stack.  A player then seeks to return that stack of caps to home-base to keep them.  The game ends when there is only one active color of caps left on the board.  In one version of the game, the winner is the player who captured the most caps of other colors during the course of the game.  In the other version of the game, the player who has active caps left on the board is the winner.&#10;&#10;According to Miscellaneous Game Book this was first published in 1927 by Otto Maier Verlag.  It led to many copycats, including two from Spears.&#10;&#10;";1927;4.95632;1.0909;2;6;30;6;Children's Game

1765;HeroQuest: Against the Ogre Horde;"Morcar sat motionless on his throne of pure jet, deep in thought. His eyes scanned the image of the Emperor&rsquo;s lands which he had conjured before him. He had been so close to victory, so nearly had he trapped and destroyed the Emperor and his forces in the ancient fortress at Karak Varn. But he had been foiled at the last minute by the Emperor&rsquo;s accursed Champions. The same fate had befallen his powerful ally, the Witch Lord, whose Army of the Dead had crumbled following the slaying of their leader.&#10;&#10;Morcar needed some new and subtle means to attack the Empire and weaken its forces before he could lead his armies against them once more. Suddenly his gaze froze and a smile sent ripples through the lines of his ancient face. A plan had come to him.&#10;&#10;A month later, Morcar again sat back to examine the scheme he had set in motion. He had never before considered the ancient race of Ogres as a potential tool. Their undisciplined and random nature made them unreliable as servants and dangerous as allies. However, using the magical arts at his disposal, Morcar had planted one of his Chaos sorcerers, Festral, within the subterranean fortress of the infamous Dirgrusht Ogre clan. Drawing from a magical pool of Chaos power, Festral had subtly taken control of the Ogre clan and started them on a series of raids on the Empire&rsquo;s farmlands. This was only the beginning, for as raids went on, other Ogre clans and Orc tribes came to swell the ranks of this new army.&#10;&#10;Contents.&#10;&#10;A new Quest Book containing 7 new adventures that must be played in sequence with rules for variable Body Points, Chaos Sorcerer Spells (Mind Lock, Dominate and Mind Blast) and new dungeon features.&#10;&#10;7 finely detailed Citadel Miniatures that require assembly featuring:&#10;- 1 Ogre Lord&#10;- 1 Ogre Chieftain&#10;- 1 Ogre Champion&#10;- 4 Ogre Warriors&#10;&#10;New full-colour die-cut game board overlays including:&#10;- 1 new large overground starting tile&#10;- 2 new double-sided room tiles&#10;- 15 Chaos Spell tokens&#10;- 4 Stone Doorways&#10;- 4 Pit of Darkness tokens&#10;- 4 Secret Door tokens&#10;- 6 Fallen Rubble tokens&#10;- 1 Ogre Throne&#10;&#10;Expands&#10;&#10;    HeroQuest&#10;&#10;&#10;";1990;7.46266;2.4828;2;5;120;8;Expansion for Base-game, Exploration, Fantasy, Fighting, Miniatures
1767;HeroQuest: Wizards of Morcar;"A Glimpse of Chaos&hellip;&#10;&#10;As the rain lashed down and thunder rumbled across the sky, a brief flash of lightning illuminated a bedraggled group of travellers. Their slow climb up the rocky slopes to the foreboding tower at the summit seemed to last an eternity. At last the figures escaped the storm and entered a dark hallway. As they peered into the shadows, they saw a sinister figure on a rocky throne.&#10;&#10;A solitary traveller stepped forward from the huddled and dripping group and addressed the presence on the throne.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;My Lord Morcar, we come bearing grave tidings.

Once again we were routed by those accursed Champions and once again we were forced to flee.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;The figure on the throne shifted and a voice like death broke the silence.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;I am aware of your failure, Festral. But as in all things I have learned from my failures. Firstly I have learned not to underestimate the Emperor&rsquo;s Heroes. Secondly, I have learned not to rely on fools. I have therefore conceived a new scheme to destroy the Emperor&rsquo;s Heroes forever. I have chosen four Lieutenants to carry out my plan. Come forth my Lieutenants.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;With that command, four silhouettes stepped from the shadows.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Let me present Zanrath, High Mage of Sarako.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;An ancient bearded man wearing a pointed hat and carrying a staff topped with a crescent moon bowed down towards Festral and his retinue.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Fanrax the Malicious.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;At the mention of his name, an evil-looking man adorned with skull symbols and toying with a wickedly sharp dagger gave a sneering smile at the group.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Boroush, the Storm Master.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;With sweep of his oaken staff, a ragged and bearded figure greeted the refugees.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;And finally, Grawshak, Orc Shaman of the Northern Tribes.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;The last of the four Lieutenants, an Orc decorated in skins, feathers and skulls, carrying a massive totem wand growled what might have been a greeting or a curse at the party.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;I believe that these four Sorcerers will succeed where you have so miserably failed. And it is they who will punish you for your failure.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;With this final word, Morcar disappeared into the shadows. From here he watched with great satisfaction as his four sorcerous Lieutenants erased all trace of Festral and his followers. Mocar smiled. These were indeed the ones who would finally destroy the Emperor&rsquo;s Heroes forever.&#10;&#10;Wizards of Morcar introduces two new elements to the HeroQuest game - four Evil Sorcerers (each with their own new spells) and Men-at-Arms to aid the Heroes on their quests.&#10;&#10;Contents.&#10;&#10;16 finely detailed Citadel Miniatures featuring:&#10;- 4 new Sorcerer Figures, 12 Men-at-Arms Figures and 24 weapons.&#10;- 1 Quest Book containing new rules and&#10;- 5 new Quests&#10;- 1 Card Sheet including:&#10;- 1 Magic Reference Chart,&#10;- 3 Magical Barriers (Stone, Fire and Ice),&#10;- 1 Earthquake Tile,&#10;- 1 Lightning Bolt Tile,&#10;- 1 Cloak of Shadows Tile,&#10;- 4 Fireburst Tokens,&#10;- 6 Blocked Square Markers,&#10;- 4 Breached Wall Tiles.&#10;&#10;- 24 Evil Sorcerer Spell Cards,&#10;- 9 new Wizard and Elf Spell Cards,&#10;- 23 Men-at-Arms Cards,&#10;- 8 new Treasure Cards.&#10;&#10;Expands&#10;&#10;    HeroQuest&#10;&#10;&#10;";1991;7.57846;2.375;2;5;120;10;Expansion for Base-game, Exploration, Fantasy, Fighting
1768;Fireball Island;"A plastic tiki idol is placed in the raised middle of a molded, 3d board, where it can rotate freely. Players move their explorer pawns up the sides of the mountain along paths and through caves, trying to reach the top of the mountain, retrieve the idol's giant ruby, and take it down the other side to the waiting boat. However, both the idol and volcanic vents throughout the board periodically spit out &quot;fireball&quot; marbles, which physically roll down the mountain, either plowing through explorer pawns in their path, or toppling triggered bridges as they pass under them.&#10;&#10;";1986;6.44161;1.3358;2;4;45;7;Action / Dexterity, Adventure, Children's Game
1770;Aliens;"Aliens allows players to recreate three key battle scenarios from the 1986 science fiction/horror film.  The scenarios include &quot;The Reactor Room&quot; (nine marines vs. the aliens in their lair), &quot;Operations and Air Ducts&quot; (the surviving marines face an alien assault and pursuit), and &quot;Ripley vs. The Queen&quot; (Ripley uses a powerloader in her final battle with the Alien Queen).  Includes a 17&quot; x 34&quot; game map, character cards, and counters, all featuring photos from the movie.&#10;&#10;Marines can have very short life spans in this game, especially if they don't work together. Game play is fast and intense - does a good job of creating the sense of urgency felt when watching the movie. Missions can be made more brutal with optional rules - plus some rule variants add to some fun &quot;what if&quot; scenarios.

1771;Cosmic Coasters;"(From the publisher:) A ten minute game of interplanetary invasion for two, played using fleets of seven coins on the moons of Jupiter. You've transported a ship to an enemy planet -- now what? Their teleport pad is under tight control. Looks like you'll have to overwhelm them with sheer numbers and do battle to the death to even send a single ship back home. You'll need cunning, and a good dose of luck to get through this alive -- and don't forget that special power you have up your sleeve... Sound complicated? Not to worry. You can always just use their entire planet as a place to put your drink.&#10;&#10;International readers should note that the components of Cosmic Coasters are printed paper fiber: Americans use &quot;coaster&quot; interchangeably to include what elsewhere might be called &quot;beermats.&quot;&#10;&#10;";2000;5.19141;1.2105;2;4;10;10;Abstract Strategy, Science Fiction
1772;Asteroid;"In Asteroid, one player controls a team of adventurers attempting to destroy a runaway mining asteroid on a collision course with Earth; the other player controls the evil computer brain that runs the mining station. The good guys must overcome the station's defenses (including various nasty robots), turn off the computer brain, set the asteroid to self-destruct, and escape before it blows.&#10;&#10;Each of the adventurers has unique characteristics, including ranged and melee combat abilities, computer skills, demolition skills, stealthiness, psychic ability, luck and even emotional attachments to other characters.&#10;&#10;The computer brain player secretly determines the configuration of the modular boards to form a map of the mining station and deploys robots to prevent the adventurers from shutting it down.&#10;&#10;Victory levels for the adventurers include World Survival Victory, Personal Survival Victory, Common Decency Victory, Romantic Victory and even SPCA Victory (involving the outcome with respect to the dog character, Sasha).&#10;&#10;One of GDW&#039;s Series 120 games, the game includes eight 5.5&quot; x 8.5&quot; maps and 120 tile counters that represent the characters, robots, items, etc.&#10;&#10;It was resold from Kokusai-Tsushin in 2003.&#10;&#10;";1980;6.64287;2.2609;2;2;180;10;Adventure, Science Fiction, Wargame
1773;Dawn of the Dead;"Dawn of the Dead (based on the classic 1978 horror film) can be played as a two-player game (humans vs. zombies), as a solitaire game, or as a cooperative game with two to four players controlling the human heroes. The game map represents the shopping mall from the movie.  Cardboard counters signify the four human characters and randomly-sized groups of zombies.  Play is highly asymmetric &mdash; the humans are fast but badly outnumbered and subject to paralyzing panic attacks, while the zombies are slow but relentless and unlimited.  To win, the zombies must kill the humans; the humans must secure the mall by closing all four entrances and eliminating all zombies within.

1774;Sale of the Century;"Based on the game show, players are asked general knowledge questions and race to come up with the right answer. Right answers win money, wrong ones lose it. At several points throughout the game, players are offered the chance to buy discounted merchandise using the money they have built up. The catch is that no player knows just how valuable the item is, only that it is offered at less than full value. After fifteen questions, the player with the most money can either buy a more expensive prize with their winnings, or keep their money in hopes of winning again, and being able to buy something even better. After each person has had a chance to host, the player with the most money and merchandise is the winner.&#10;&#10;Two editions were made of the original 1969-74 series, although the first was reprinted (in 1971?) with an altered cover: one prize was changed to a TV, and the set shot cuts off the left side (where the host is) in favor of another prize.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;     Sale of the Century Quizzard&#10;&#10;&#10;";1969;5.57667;2.0;3;5;30;10;Movies / TV / Radio theme, Trivia

1776;Divine Right: Scarlet Empire;"Starting in 1997, Glenn Rahman designed an extension to his fabulous game Divine Right.  Scarlet Empire took place in a different period in that game's world, and further to the south of the original map.  It was designed as a stand alone game that could also be played in combination with the other one.  The campaign game pits most of the players against the one playing the Scarlet Witch King.&#10;&#10;If you liked Divine Right, you'd like Scarlet Empire -- everything that made the first game great is also present in the other.  Mercenaries, special locations, diplomacy, magic, etc.&#10;&#10;Scarlet Empire was supposed to be published by Excalibre Games and made it as far as the advanced play-test stages, but the publisher hemmed and hawed and tried to cut costs, so much so Glen eventually gave up in disgust.

Fighting against extinction is a hastily gathered force of human ships.  Cruisers and C-plus guns batter the Berserkers from afar, while Earth's only hope - the ram ships - swarm like killer bees.  Inside the ram ships huddle the marines who must board the Berserker and destroy it from within...&#10;&#10;Berserker is an easy and thrilling game of the human struggle for survival against Berserkers.

1780;Knights of Camelot;"Knights of Camelot ranks right alongside Divine Right; it is an early TSR game brimming with flavour.&#10;&#10;The players are freshly knighted and wander the Arthurian realm looking for damsels in distress, brigands, monsters, other knights to joust with, etc. The game uses a random table generation driver that can lead to an enormous variety of encounters. I remember fondly two incidents:&#10;&#10;In the first, a knight met a Dwarf on a horse. Deciding to approach and meet him (instead of avoiding or charging), the dwarf turned out to be a knight in disguise&mdash;but not just any knight! It was Lancelot, the foremost knight of the realm! We had a sudden vision of the hollowed-out horse necessary to hide Lancelot's bulk&hellip;&#10;&#10;In another incident, a player led a charmed life and pulled ahead of the others in their quest for the Holy Grail. He met Merlin repeatedly and ended up with a special charger, magic lance, and magic shield&mdash;the works! England wasn't much of a challenge for him any more, so he decided to cross the Channel to France. Bad move! His ship sank in a storm so he washed up on the shore minus all his equipment and followers. Dejected, he trudged to the nearest castle to ask for help&mdash;but a giant jumped out of the moat and killed him in one blow!&#10;&#10;The game has heavy role-playing elements to it; articles in Dragon Magazine, Issue# 58 explained how one could play knaves (bad knights), and GMs have been known to use the game as an adventure generator for RPGs.&#10;&#10;";1980;6.536;2.4286;2;6;240;12;Adventure, Fantasy, Medieval, Wargame

1784;Dark Cults;"An early story-telling card game from the co-designer of Divine Right and Knights of Camelot.&#10;&#10;It is a story-telling card game, foreshadowing Once Upon a Time: The Storytelling Card Game.  In it, the two players represent Life and Death, respectively, and each tries to guide a horror story to their corresponding outcome.  As well as horror, the creator suggests that the game could be used for a science-fiction or mystery story, although the game's cards may be poorly suited to this.&#10;&#10;The second edition was packaged with a magazine called The Cultist.

1785;King's Bounty;"Released in 1991 by Task Force Games, King's Bounty resembles its like-named 1990 computer game counterpart from New World Computing: the players are rival bounty hunters, each riding through the kingdom, hunting down monsters and other miscreants upon whose heads the king has put a prize. Despite the release dates, the board game was actually designed prior to the computer game.&#10;&#10;The turn-based computer game's origin began with fighting mechanics that were meant to have a similar flavor to Avalon Hill's Titan, but the program lacked a story-line and theme. Meanwhile, development of the King's Bounty board game was wrapping up under the working title of &quot;Bounty Hunter.&quot; New World Computing, which owned Task Force Games at the time, decided to have the computer game adopt a storyline and theme similar to that of the board game.&#10;&#10;The computer game, designed by Jon Van Caneghem, is notably considered the forerunner of the Heroes of Might and Magic series of computer and video games. A sequel to the original computer game, called King's Bounty: The Legend, was released in 2008.&#10;&#10;New World Computing transferred ownership of Task Force Games  prior to the production of the board game, which delayed the board game's release. The major remaining component that had to be completed was final production and layout of the rule book, which is why rules artwork changed from that produced for other game components. However, the box cover art, originally contracted and completed for the board game and then adopted by the computer game, remained unchanged upon the board game's release.&#10;&#10;";1991;5.62246;2.5556;1;8;300;12;Fantasy, Fighting, Video Game Theme

The &quot;damage&quot; to the target's &quot;fresh air points&quot; is the product of the two card values.  Upon having to &quot;leave the room&quot; because you ran out of fresh air, you get an &quot;act of ultimate flatulence&quot;: firing off all remaining food and fart card pairs.&#10;&#10;The only parody of Magic here is the title.

Dividends are then paid (based on railroad value and total number of shares), and a new round is started.  The game lasts for nine rounds, at which time a final payoff is made based on value, income, and actual shares sold.  There are only 5 shares of each railroad available, with the money from the stock purchase going into the railroad treasury.  Also, all track construction must be paid for out of railroad treasuries, and the track is drawn along pre-defined routes using plastic crayons.

1800;Mythos;"In this card game based in H.P Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, you play an investigator (represented by a double sized card that has your stats, special abilities and keeps your story organized) who must complete stories without going insane.  From a deck of at least 52 cards you draw 13 and take turns playing one at a time so it moves at a brisk pace.  You stock your deck with at least 20 points of stories (usually 3 or 4) and try to get the required cards into play.  As an example The card 'A Day in the Life of a M. U. Student' requires you to visit 3 Different Miskatonic University Locations, cast a spell, summon a monster, go to a country site and play an ally of the opposite sex.  When you have fulfilled the conditions you score the card and gain sanity.  In this card's case you score 8 points and gain 2 sanity.&#10;&#10;The types of cards you have are locations (you almost always occupy one), allies, monsters, events, tomes, spells, artifacts and adventures.  A round lasts until there are two passes, at which time all monsters played fight each other then go after the investigators to disable their allies or reduce their sanity.  You can throw allies in front of the monsters as cannon fodder to protect your investigator.  You then decide what cards you are going to keep in your hand (each investigator has a minimum and a maximum number of cards that must be kept) and draw back to 13 for the next round.  Because of this you blow through your deck very quickly and you will go through it a couple of times in most games.&#10;&#10;There are also some very nasty phobias and events to play on your opponents to interfere with their strategies.  There is a lot of interaction and the Lovecraftian atmosphere is keenly felt.&#10;&#10;";1996;6.65293;2.5556;1;10;45;10;Adventure, Card Game, Collectible Components, Fighting, Horror, Novel-based

1816;Mississippi;"An abstract race game set on the Mississippi river. Each person has a boat (actually a hexagonal piece with the numbers 1-6 written on each of the 6 sides of the piece). The board is a long track of hexes that wind back and forth in an 'S' pattern. Each person places his 'boat' on the start space with one of the numbers facing forwards. Each person also starts with a number of 'Logs'. These are used to move your boat forward 1 space for each log spent. (You can also decide to move backwards - gaining 1 log for each space moved back).&#10;&#10;Now comes the complication - bumping. If your boat stops in a space that is adjacent to 1 or more others, bumping occurs. To determine where your boat ends up you look at the hex sides facing each other (on your boat and on the adjacent one(s)). You subtract the adjacent boat's hex side number from yours - and if it is positive your boat moves forward that number of spaces, and if negative - the other boat moves forward that number of spaces. Now you check to see if your boat is adjacent to another boat and if so repeat the bumping procedure.&#10;&#10;If your boat is next to more than 1 boat, and has at least 1 positive difference, your boat moves forward. If you have more than 1 positive, add them together and move forward that distance. If you have a negative difference the other boats move in clockwise order.&#10;&#10;For subsequent turns - you can freely change the facing (&amp; thus the hex side number facing forward) by 60 degrees. Moving it further than 1 hexside costs you 1 &quot;log&quot; per extra 60 degree facing change. You then decide whether to move forward or back and resolve any bumping.&#10;&#10;The first boat to the finish wins.&#10;&#10;";1987;5.9423;2.1053;2;6;60;10;Abstract Strategy, Nautical, Racing
1820;Z-G;"Z-G is a combination miniatures wargame/collectible card game. The miniatures, which represent arena combat robots, are actually 5&quot; action figures with 14 points of articulation and 8 pieces of removable armor. Each piece of armor has a corresponding collectible card giving its statistics and special powers. Each basic set includes a fixed 10 card set (1 card per piece of equipment, including the figure itself, plus a character card)&#10;&#10;The game is played in rounds, which start with all players choosing which 3 pieces of equipment to use this round. Each piece of equipment also has an impulse rating, and whoever has the highest impulse goes first. Players then use their cards to move their figure a number of card lengths and/or use attacks based on a color-matching system on the ends of each card. If your attack is successful, a piece of your opponent's armor is destroyed (and so is its corresponding card).&#10;&#10;One of the more innovative parts in all this is that the actual figure poses have bearing on gameplay. Movement points must be used to enter a stance, and each stance has certain advantages and disadvantages (Except lying down, which is universally bad)&#10;&#10;Z-G was first shown publicly for sale and demonstration at Origins 2001 in Columbus, Ohio, with the subtitle &quot;Citizen.&quot; Although planned as the first set in a series of sets, &quot;Citizen Z-G&quot; was ultimately the only published set.&#10;&#10;";2001;6.75;2.3333;2;4;60;10;Collectible Components, Miniatures, Science Fiction

Although only a single deck of strategy cards is used, &agrave; la We the People, the two sides are dramatically different in character: the French are irregular-heavy (especially Indians) and rely on raiding to tie down the superior numbers of British Regular &amp; Provincial drilled troops, who will themselves be intent on sieges and trying to force a pitched battle. Like Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, the fortunes of war turn as the game goes on: the French are masters early, with the crushing British manpower advantage accruing late.&#10;&#10;Wilderness War takes two players into the French &amp; Indian War, 1755-1760, the climactic struggle between France and Britain for control of North America. It uses strategy cards and a point-to-point map similar to GMT's award winning For the People and Paths of Glory. Players maneuver and fight over a map stretching from Northern Virginia to Canada. As the leader of French or British forces in North America, you will need to defend your frontier, raid your enemy's frontier, build fortification networks through the harsh wilderness, recruit Indian allies, besiege forts and fortresses, and deal with events occurring in Europe that are above and beyond your control.&#10;&#10;Wilderness War includes a deck of strategy cards for conducting campaigns and incorporating the many events and personalities of the war. The French player can recruit up to sixteen different Indian tribes as allies, secure a continental alliance in Europe against Great Britain, sortie his squadron at Louisbourg, force a ministerial crisis in London, and work toward draining support for the war from the provincial assemblies. The British player can recruit Mohawks and Cherokees, plan for and conduct amphibious operations, implement a global strategy via William Pitt, destroy the French fleet at Quiberon Bay, and expel the Acadians. Relive the history of this exciting time when the fate of Canada hung in the balance.&#10;&#10;Wilderness War is by the designer of the more recent Labyrinth: The War on Terror, 2001 &#226;&#128;&#147; ? and Andean Abyss and other Series: COIN (GMT) games.&#10;&#10;";2001;7.69922;3.307;1;2;180;12;Age of Reason, American Indian Wars, Wargame

1828;Doomsday Cult 2000;"In Doomsday Cult 2000, players take the role of cult leaders bent on bringing about the end of the world.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player secretly chooses a Doomsday date in the month of December, 1999 (play commences on December 1st, and each turn is one day long). From there, play mechanics are reminiscent of Steve Jackson's Illuminati: cards representing potential cult members (a/k/a Sheep) are dealt into a common pool in the middle of the table. Players in their turn use Influence to recruit Sheep for their Flock (cult); each new Sheep you control adds to your Influence, and many of them grant special abilities as well. In addition to recruiting uncontrolled Sheep, you can also try to convert (steal) or &quot;deprogram&quot; (make uncontrolled) Sheep belonging to other players' Flocks, or declare jihad and have one of your Sheep making a suicide attack on one of your rivals' Sheep.&#10;&#10;When your chosen Doomsday comes around, all of the Sheep you currently control commit ritual mass suicide in an attempt to trigger the apocalypse. A die roll determines whether they succeed; the more Sheep you sacrifice, the better the odds. If you do successfully end the world, you win; if you fail, you pick a new Doomsday and start gathering a Flock again; if the world hasn't ended by January 1st, 2000, everybody loses.&#10;&#10;The game is DTP quality, with the cards laser-printed on (pre-cut) heavy marbled paper.&#10;&#10;";1998;0.0;0.0;2;6;30;10;Card Game

If those are used skilfully, the resulting economy of Fighter Command operations might just be able to offset the sheer power of the German Luftflotten (&quot;air fleets&quot;).&#10;&#10;You are in command of all four RAF Fighter Groups to match them against the incoming raids. Can you deny the Luftwaffe its objective to weaken the British air defence system beyond the breaking point?&#10;&#10;";1990;6.48013;2.1622;2;2;120;12;Aviation / Flight, Miniatures, Wargame, World War II

1858;Diamond City;"A bank robbery has occurred in Diamond City. All the players are eye witnesses and their task is to find and identify the robber. You are running around the board checking concealed cards to get clues to the robber. Instead of clues you might find other valuable cards, like money, weapons, duel cards or the large diamond.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to find out who the robber is and transport him to the police station, without any of the opponent kidnapping him to get the honor from you. If it shows up that yourself are the robber (1 chance out of 27), then you must steal back the diamond and escape to the airport.&#10;&#10;Note: Nelospelit already published this sometime in the latter half of the 1980's as Silminn&auml;kij&auml; (Eyewitness), when it was a Wild West themed game set in 'Tuscon' (sic). The 'diamond' was 'loot' from a robbery, the cars horses, and so on, the production values a little bit weaker, but otherwise it is exactly the same game.&#10;&#10;";1995;3.56897;1.0;2;6;90;8;Card Game, Children's Game, Deduction

1868;Conquistador;"A simple card game of empire-building rivalry.&#10;&#10;There are some 15 territory cards rated 1 through 3, some of which are dealt out to the players at the start (each gets a 1 and a 2 territory).  There are Revolt and Cannon cards.  The remaining cards are Development cards, each rated from 1 to 6.  On your turn, you draw a card and play or discard one.  The deck of a little over a hundred cards is played through and then everyone scores.  Once the deck is exhausted, play continues until everyone's hand is also exhausted.  Once your hand drops below four cards, there are some limitations on card play that come into effect.&#10;&#10;When developing a Territory you own, you ideally would play a 1, then a 2, and so on up to a 6.  The developments must be played in increasing numerical sequence, but they need not be consecutive.  At the end of the game, a territory scores the number of development cards on it times its basic multiplier (1&times;, 2&times; or 3&times;) - so an undeveloped territory is worthless.  If you managed to have a sequence of at least four consecutive developments on the territory, you score a sizable bonus.&#10;&#10;Revolt cards prevent a territory from being developed or attacked; they also cancel an existing revolt card (there are only 8 of those in the deck).  It is sometimes good strategy to play a revolt on a territory of your own to prevent it from being attacked.&#10;&#10;Cannon cards are used to attack other players' territories; you play a cannon face down, and so does the defender.  Both reveal their cards and add a die roll.  The attacker's total must beat the defender's for the attack to succeed.  When it does, you roll a die and this indicates how many cards you plunder from that territory.  If that roll is high enough, you can even steal the territory itself.  Plundered cards must be allocated to your territories right away or discarded.&#10;&#10;Cannon can also be used, if rated four or better, to empty one of your territories from its development cards so as to redeploy them - in effect, you are raiding yourself.&#10;&#10;A number of small variant rules are supplied in the rule book.  The cards are printed in French, English and Dutch.&#10;&#10;It is good strategy to build your hand for the end game, so you can, for example, protect a territory with a Revolt, then unprotect it, redeploy Development cards with a strong Cannon, and complete the territory's development with your last few card plays.&#10;&#10;Awards&#10;&#10;Card Game As d&#039;Or 2001&#10;&#10;";2001;5.0;2.25;2;4;60;8;Card Game, Economic, Renaissance
1870;Gold Train;"Frontier discovery, labor shortages and gold mines are the focus of Gold Train.  This game forces difficult decisions and often unpleasant player interaction.  Set in the Old West of the USA.&#10;&#10;The game board is constructed by the players at the start of the game.  During the setup, initial terrain tiles are placed (mostly face down) starting at the center of the board and moving out in rings (similar to Twilight Imperium: Third Edition).  Only a portion of the tiles are uncovered at the start and the board is different every game.&#10;&#10;Players bid for starting areas and play begins.  &#10;Players search (or discover) terrain (similar to the search process used in 2038: Tycoons of the Asteroid Belt).  This phase also allows players to apply various counters that affect terrain (help themselves or hurt other players) and to discover mines.&#10;Then players use labor that they have procured to build tracks.&#10;Finally, players get paid.  If a player has track to a mine, the railroad services the mine and collects income.  Coal mines pay the least and Gold mines pay the most.&#10;&#10;But watch out for the Dalton Boys or the Clinton gang.&#10;&#10;";2000;5.08824;2.0;2;6;120;12;American West, Economic, Trains, Transportation

They must buy insurance and take advantage of opportunities to prepare their resorts, or face the imminent threat of the hurricane!  There are many different hurricane tracks based on real historical data, which are written on hurricane program cards that are moved through a sleeve.  The players never know where the hurricane will move next.  There is also an advanced play option, where players cruise their yachts through the inner game board from one resort to the next, while trying to avoid the inevitable hurricanes.  But players must also beware of another threat... The Bermuda Triangle!

NASA projects Mercury, Gemini and Apollo provide the backdrop as players are put in command of the Space Race. Each landmark event, pioneering mission, heart-pounding crisis and incredible machine is represented by a playing card. Players use these cards and a supply of fuel cards to complete the historic NASA space missions in a race to be the first to land on the Moon.&#10;&#10;To complete each mission, you must use your fuel supply to assemble the correct equipment, launch the mission and move your playing piece to the corresponding mission patch on the game board. This completes the mission, you receive a replica mission patch and gain a fuel bonus. During the game you can take advantage of special cards called alarms, events and instants. These represent historic events in space history and can be played to speed you progress or hinder your opponents. After completing the required number of missions, be the first to land on the Moon and win the game. MOONSHOT has a wealth of detail and flavor for the space enthusiast.

It is also the first historical boardgame published, in two decades, to address galley warfare. As such, GMT's War Galley is almost a complete history for this era of war at sea.&#10;&#10;What is best about War Galley is how easy it is to play -- the rules are about half the length of the usual GBoH game -- and that means that most battles can be complete in several hours, at the most. The battles themselves, cover all aspects of galley tactics, from the line against line of big ships at Salamis (Cyprus), to the Chase, Turn and Fight of Chios, to the Line Astern vs. Line Abreast at Side, to probably the most unusual of all ancient battles, the Roman arrowhead against the Carthaginian Lines Astern at Drepanum in 249 B.C.&#10;&#10;War Galley wars and battles covered by the scenarios are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Ionian Revolt- Lade, 494 BC&#10;     Peloponnesian War- Arginusae, 406 BC&#10;     The Silician Wars- Catana, 397 BC&#10;     The First Successor War- Salamis, 306 BC (Cyprus)&#10;     The First Punic War&#10;         Ecnomus, 256 BC&#10;         Drepanum, 249 BC&#10;         Aegatian Islands, 242 BC &#10;    &#10;     The Macedonian Wars- Chios, 201 BC&#10;     The War with Antiochus&#10;         Side, 190 BC&#10;         Myonessus, 190 BC &#10;    &#10;     The Civil War&#10;         Tauris, 47 BC&#10;         Naulochus, 36 BC&#10;         Actium, 31 BC &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;";1999;7.10933;3.125;1;2;360;14;Ancient, Nautical, Wargame

Finally there are counters depicting the 32 teams in the tournament.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with five random cards and the team counters are randomly distributed to each of the players (showing which team each player will 'manage'). Each team is rated either as 0, 1, or 2 - this is the 'bonus' number of goals that team will score in each match it plays.&#10;&#10;Each player in turn can play a card onto any soccer field. On the preliminary matches (fields), the cards are placed face-up (maximum of 3 cards), on any other field, the card is placed face-down. Once all the fields are full, the matches are resolved with the winner of the match going on to the next. Once the preliminary matches are resolved and the teams determined for the next round, those cards are flipped over and the results determined. This is done all the way to the finals.&#10;&#10;A player can determine where his team will end up playing each subsequent match and play cards face-down to try to get his team to win, but if your team is upset early - all those face-down cards that you played are now going to help some other team and not yours.&#10;&#10;";1993;6.37727;1.6667;2;10;60;10;Bluffing, Card Game, Sports

(Partners are not the fellow players at the table - but the chosen partner card of the same color as the wooden piece).&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt 12 sympathy cards. These cards are played on your turn and are used to move or exchange a partner figure. There are 3 different types of sympathy cards: the cards with the numbers are used to move the corresponding colord figure on the board; the cards with an arrow moves the corresponding piece forward to the space of another playing piece; finally the cards with the text are played and the actions carried out immediately.  Alternatively, each numbered or arrowed sympathy card can be used to exchange partner cards with another player.&#10;&#10;The game starts with a player playing a numbered Sympathy Card and moving the corresponding piece forward that number of spaces, then drawing a new card. The next player then takes his turn, etc. Play continues in this manner - moving or swapping pieces until a player is able to get to the finish (7th Heaven) while holding the correct colored partner card for his playing piece. If no-one makes it to 7th Heaven, the game ends when the last sympathy card is played. The winner in that case is the player with the correct partner card who is closest to 7th Heaven.&#10;&#10;";1989;4.63333;1.6667;2;6;60;8;Abstract Strategy, Fantasy
1916;Shuttles;"From the box:&#10;Shuttles is a game of strategy for two players, ages 8 to adult. By moving playing pieces and game board sliders, players maneuver around variable barriers in a race to be the first to reach their goal. This challenging game develops strategic thinking skills, and by solving strategy problems, helps children to develop solutions to real-life problems.&quot;&#10;&#10;The board is made up of nine or seven horizontal rows (&quot;sliders&quot;) containing various combinations of holes and barriers. The players start with five pegs each, on opposite ends of the board, and attempt to be the first to get all of their pegs to the other side. On a turn, the player can either move a peg orthogonally as far as they want without crossing a boundary, or they can move one of the rows left or right, shifting the location of the holes and barriers in an attempt to block their opponent's moves or open a path for their own pegs.&#10;&#10;";1973;5.73746;1.625;2;2;20;8;Abstract Strategy, Maze, Racing

Players sharpen their memory as they form programs by matching terms from the popular BASIC computer programming language. Competition intensifies as opponents wipe out each others programs and damage each others disks. Definitions, with questions and answers, are provided for those who wish to learn more about the terms. Miniature computer paper is included for keeping score.

1920;The Business Game;"Board of two joined leaves, 12 mine derricks (2 of each of 6 colours), 6 lorries [trucks], 5 barges, 2 ships, 90 pyramids (15 of each of 6 colours), 24 cubes (4 of each of 6 colours), 26 production cards, 6 Canal Company Title Deeds, 2 production debit cards, 1 die, sterling and dollar currency.&#10;&#10;The players are operating a mine and trying to get the ore to market, but must compete with each other for the limited transportation resources.  The ore has to be transported initially by lorries and also later by barges to the coastal warehouse.  All transport has to be hired and there is always less transport available than required, favouring those who are prepared to take a risk on achieving a quick journey without mishap.  For example there are only 5 barges (always one less than the numbers of players) to encourage competition and load sharing.  You can also force other players to pay you for taking their ore to make up a barge load as all barges have to travel fully laden.  Much depends on how long a journey takes.  New ore can only be obtained by throwing a 1 or a six which also triggers the playing of a production card which can be favourable or not.&#10;&#10;From the coastal warehouse, barges and ships are used to transport ore out to sea to foreign ports to sell to gradually earn the Million Dollars needed to win the game.  The second set of money (dollars) is thus actually a victory point counting device and not actual currency (i.e. it cannot be spent).&#10;&#10;It works well with any number of players (when playing with a smaller complement, each player operates multiple mines) except five, as the competition factor on one side of the board is uneven with the other.&#10;&#10;";1965;5.93671;2.0789;2;6;90;8;Economic, Transportation
1924;Maloney's Inheritance;"Players are traveling from city-to-city with a single car.  All players have a goal to reach a different city at a certain time in order to maximize points.  As each player has a different set of goals, some players will benefit while others will lose out.&#10;&#10;On each turn, the control of the car will be auctioned. After the auction round, the winner pays the bank and chooses the destination for the car.&#10;&#10;Upon arrival at a city, the driver receives that city's suitcase. This suitcase can indicate that the driver receives up to five points or $1,500.  It may also say that he loses up to three points or $1,000.&#10;&#10;Additionally, upon arriving in a city, players may play action cards that correspond to the city. Points are awarded depending on the day of the week of the arrival.  Tuesdays and Fridays you receive double points.&#10;&#10;The game ends either when a player has received 69 points or when a player is out of action cards.

1930;Anti-Monopoly III: Washington-Moskau;"Each of the players represents a Nuclear Power.  The aim of the game is to maintain world peace and avoid nuclear war.  An &quot;Arms Spiral&quot; is in the middle of the board, representing the arms race.  When the &quot;BOMB&quot; arrives at the end of the Arms Spiral, world peace is over and everyone has lost!  However, if all players work together in such a way that one reaches the &quot;World Peace&quot; space, then the arms race is over.  All players have won and the one who has contributed the most to maintaining world peace is declared winner.&#10;&#10;To prevent destruction each player must simultaneously pursue his own goals as well co-operate with the other players to maintain peace.  Each one can pursue his personal selfish goal to come to a victory, but this promotes the arms race.&#10;&#10;The American version of this game is called Star Peace: Anti Nuclear War.&#10;&#10;";1987;4.0;1.0;2;6;120;10;Negotiation, Political
1932;Anti-Monopoly II;"(Note: Not to be confused with the original Anti-Monopoly, even though recent versions of Anti-Monopoly II are called simply &quot;Anti-Monopoly&quot;. As for the reasons why this is so, please see the clarifications at the end of this article and the article of Anti-Monopoly.)&#10;&#10;In this game the players follow either the rules for Monopolists or those for Competitors. Competitors charge fair rents, build as soon as they own a property, place four houses (green) at the most, after which they build a hotel (red) and occasionally go to Price War. On the other hand, Monopolists extort monopoly-high rents from their poor tenants, build only after they have at least two streets of one color, restrict supply by putting only three houses on their properties, after which they also are allowed to build a hotel (red) and occasionally go to prison!&#10;&#10;The good guys are the small entrepreneurs and the bad guys are the monopolists. Since players do not play by the same rules, fairness is achieved by a win probability equalization technique (which is where the second author comes in).&#10;&#10;Competitors make more money than Monopolists in the beginning of the game but Monopolists can catch up later, especially if Competitors don't watch their money!&#10;&#10;The game was first published as &quot;Choice&quot; because Anspach was forbidden to use the word &quot;Monopoly&quot; by the courts. When that was overturned in 1983, the name was changed to &quot;Anti-Monopoly II&quot;. In 1987, believing that consumer confusion between Anti-Monopoly and Anti-Monopoly II was harming sales of the latter game, Anspach ceased the production of the original game and removed the &quot;II&quot; from the name of the latter game.&#10;&#10;";1977;3.74221;1.5;2;6;120;8;Economic
1934;Up & Down;"In Up &amp; Down players try to have the best combination of cards at the end of the game. One can aim at having all cards in his hand neutralised which gives 50 points. In all other cases one just has to add all values of the cards owned when the game ends. The gameplay is based on actions - one of which a player must choose in his turn: neutralising cards lying on the table, discarding or drawing. Number of cards drawn or discarded depends on what cards lie on the table.&#10;&#10;One gameplay is very short but the rules suggest that the game should be played several times with results written down and summed up.&#10;&#10;";1996;4.72456;1.0;2;6;60;10;Card Game

If there are fewer players, specific cards are removed. Each player is dealt 12 cards.&#10;&#10;The start player calls a colour. Each player puts a  card in front of him/herself, face down. If you have a card of the called colour, you have to put down a card of that colour. If not, you can choose any of your cards.&#10;&#10;When all players have put down a card, each player decides if he/she wants to reveal his/her card, starting with the start player. You can only reveal your card if it is of the colour that was called. But if you have played a card in the called colour, you can choose to pretend you didn't and thus don't reveal your card.&#10;&#10;If nobody reveals a card, the caller stays in control.

Then all played cards are put into a stack next to the player.&#10;If the player in control doubts a player, that player has to reveal his/her played card. If it is of the called colour, the doubted player must take all the played cards. If the player in control incorrectly doubts a player (i.e. they played a card in a different colour), the doubter must take all the played cards. Some cards have fried eggs printed on them, which count as negative points.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the last card has been played.&#10;Each egg card is worth 3 points, each fried egg on one of the cards a player has received counts as -1.

1952;Long Short;"The game board shows price charts/tables for 6 commodities 2 each of 3 different price levels.  Every player id dealt 10 commodity cards which change the price up or down of one or more of the commodities.  Every player starts with $10,000 and the winner is the player who has the most money after everyone has played all ten of their cards.&#10;&#10;On a players turn they can: 1 - enter or close out a contract (going either long - betting the price will go up; or short - betting the price will go down; 2-  play a price movement card; 3 - roll the dice (usually either resulting in a commodity price movement or an action card draw (random event)).&#10;&#10;The nature of the futures market is that you take positions based on whether you believe a commodity price will go up or down.  If you think the price will rise, you buy or go 'long' of the commodity hoping that by the time the contract matures, you can sell them back at a profit. Conversely, if your hunch (or information) is that prices will fall, you sell or go 'short' thinking you can close out the deal at a lower price, again making money. So the logic is that whatever way the market moves, you can make profits - if you are right.    The one thing that this game does is give each person at least one chance to sell a contract at any time - not just on your turn - so if you think it is the perfect time - you can interrupt another player's turn to sell to lock in your profits.&#10;&#10;The game is over after everyone plays their last card - and no new contracts can be started during the last round (1 card left).  There is still quite a bit of luck in the game,  with wild swings possible in some commodity prices, but you start with all the cards you will have and therefore have a good bit of information about some price swing possibilities - all you need is some help and a bit of help from the random events.&#10;&#10;";1982;6.31531;1.75;2;6;60;12;Bluffing, Economic

1958;The Game of Nations;"This game is a geopolitical simulation of local influence in the Middle East on the flow of oil supplies to the rest of the world.&#10;&#10;The map shows 8 fictitious Middle Eastern oil producing countries, one of which controls the Canal that links both ocean sides. If your superpower is on one ocean and you try to obtain oil from a country bordering on the other ocean, the Canal becomes of vital strategic importance. The alternative is to connect that country to another on the &quot;correct&quot; side of the board (through the land-locked middle countries, which are also bigger producers) with a series of pipelines. To move oil you must, of course, have a friendly leader in place at the head of that country.&#10;&#10;You start with a leader of your color on the capital of a country and one tanker that can transport oil from that country's port to your country. To reflect a level of organisation, oil is worth more per shipping if a king or politician is in place than a dictator or guerrilla, whose job is more offensive. You spend money to move leader pieces about the board, with the managing pieces costing more than the offensive pieces. Secret agents also move each turn and are used to defend attacks by blocking the path of opposing leaders and for moving onto &quot;?&quot; spaces to take a gamble on an incident card. At face value, half the cards are favourable and half not, but all offer diplomatic opportunities for the country who is most stable.&#10;&#10;To survive players must continually manage risks while trying to maximize their oil revenue. Early bold attacks, even combined with the right incident card, are not recommended: a co-operative approach to the game maximises revenue to offset the many accidents which can happen in the game.&#10;&#10;From the Waddington ad for the game dated 1972:&#10;&#10;A political strategy game&#10;&quot;In the modern world of international diplomacy and intrigue, there are many stakes in this game of economic survival.

1964;Campaign;"Not to be confused with Campaign, the identically named game produced by Wills and Hepworth in the 1940's.&#10;&#10;&quot;An exciting strategy game in which each player can become a Napoleon or a Wellington leading his army across Europe.  Famous battles can be re-fought and alliances can be made and broken with this compelling game of military and political strategy&quot;&#10;&#10;Large playing board in three sections, four sets of army pieces in red, white, blue and light green, comprising 1 General, 9 infantry and 9 cavalry units.  Six sets of 4 town cards of different colors, 4 alliance cards, 2 dice, 6 page rule book, and a 4 page &quot;The Years of Napoleon&quot; historical booklet.&#10;&#10;The game reproduces the Napoleonic wars at the strategic level in a very abstract fashion (all players are equal).  It can be won either by the outright defeat of your opponent, or (more likely) by acquiring towns controlling large areas of territory.  The board is an abstract representation of Europe and western Russia and is divided into six areas of roughly equal size representing France, Prussia, Russia, Austria, Italy and Spain.&#10;&#10;Each country has four provincial towns, and five of the countries used as starting countries also have a capital city.  Parts of the board, particularly the central area, have areas of impenetrable mountains, forests, and sea which restrict the movement of the troops.&#10;&#10;There are introductory and standard rules.  Normally, each player selects a country, but in the two player game each gets two countries except that the France + Prussia combo is not allowed.&#10;&#10;The pieces move using the dice, and combat is deterministic.  The throw can be used all on one piece or many pieces.  The full throw does not have to be used.  The pieces are placed in a set format on the country selected, with the General on the capital square and four infanty and four cavalry. The town cards are used to keep track of who controls what.&#10;&#10;The pieces move in set ways. The General moves one square in any direction. When it attacks it has a value of one and when defending a value of two. The General must be present to take a town.  Cavalry moves two squares at a time and must move horizontally or vertically but never diagonally.  Infantry moves one square and only diagonally.  Pieces cannot pass through opposing lines unless there is a clear gap of at least one square.&#10;&#10;Combat is like movement: one considers which pieces could be moved to the target piece's square and totals up the combat value --if large enough, the opposing piece is removed.  Only one piece can be attacked in a turn.  In the standard game, adjacent pieces also support each other (in a manner reminiscent of Diplomacy), which introduces a fair amount of tactics in on-going battles.&#10;&#10;Lost pieces are regenerated in your country's mustering area, forcing you to keep a constant flow of recruits towards the front.  In the standard game, the towns also represent logistical support --lose the town and you lose the corresponding piece.&#10;&#10;The odd movement system means you actually have two sets of cavalry and infantry pieces on the board, each set (which we could call &quot;odd&quot; and &quot;even&quot;) being unable to assist the other.&#10;&#10;A capital can only be captured after the provincial towns have been captured.  Where more than two players are playing you can agree to ally with another player and exchange alliance cards as reminders.  An ally cannot cross into his ally's territory without his consent.  Alliances can be broken simply by announcing the fact; you can attack your former ally on your next turn only, giving him a turn to re-deploy.&#10;&#10;The game is won if the player captures all his opponents capitals or captures 8 towns of any colour but not including the 4 in his own country.  You also win if your opponent's General is left with no troops.&#10;&#10;Campaign is basically a pure strategy game.  It you are in a position to attack a piece, you will take it.  However, there is some luck depending on how high a movement throw you have.&#10;&#10;from the Waddington ad for the game from 1976:   &quot;This absorbing strategy game captures the tension and the pressures of the famous Napoleonc battles. Alliances are made and broken and complex manoevers bring victory or defeat&quot;&#10;&#10;";1971;5.48583;2.303;2;4;120;10;Abstract Strategy, Napoleonic, Wargame

Such a game is OH-WAH-REE, now available in a special edition to suit modern tastes. Like other historic games, OH-WAH-REE appeals to players of all ages; children love it as a fast-moving game of pebble and pit action and capture; adults, playing in another dimension, enjoy it as an exercise in long-range planning and execution. OH-WAH-REE can be played by two, three, or four players. The contoured fold-away board, pebbles, markers, and instruction folder go into a handsome case which fits easily on any bookshelf.&#10;&#10;This is a  Mancala game with additional rules to allow play for up to 4 players.  The players mark their pits by placing a colored marble in a hole next to the pit.

There are master thieves, pickpockets and thieves cards and 1-8 numbered value cards in a deck of 112 cards.&#10;&#10;The game uses matching of cards to raid your opponents loot and has an element of role selection as you can use cards to choose to raid another player or the discard pile. The mechanism involves using your cards matching them and plundering points from other players. For example the master thief card allows you to steal a pile of loot from another player, the pickpocket allows you to get a card from an opponents hand. The game ends when the draw pile is empty.&#10;&#10;";1989;5.375;1.0;2;6;30;6;Card Game

Players must play a card in the same color as the first card played. The player playing the highest card in that color after all other players have passed then moves the car of that color farthest back in the line, along with all cars behind it, in reverse order to the front of the line, scoring 1 point for each car moved. If the pace car is among those moved, it does not score but rather doubles the points for all other cars that move up.&#10;&#10;";1993;5.2037;0.0;3;5;30;6;Card Game, Racing

The goal of the game is to get rid of one's entire stack first. This is achieved by putting cards down on stacks in the middle of the table. Those stacks have to be in numerical order, starting with 1 and finishing with 10 (there are Joker cards to fill gaps).

The game is played using mostly standard trick-taking rules: Each turn, someone plays a card to the center of the table, then in turn each player lays down (if possible) a card matching the suit or rank of the card led, throwing out any other card otherwise. The highest card in the color led wins the trick, and that player leads the next trick. Points come only from the black cards, with the black spies (yes, &quot;spies&quot;, with six black #7 cards) being worth ten points each and all other black cards worth 1-5 points. When someone reaches 200 or more points at the end of a round, the game ends and the player with the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;";1981;6.34067;1.4;3;6;45;14;Card Game, Spies / Secret Agents

Whenever you visit the Bank, you have the option of holding it up, in which case the game switches to a different mode, which uses the inside of the board.  This shows a map of the Far West --you are now an outlaw on that map, running for the border.  Those of the other players that want to are also put on the map as bounty hunters.

1985;Overturn;"From the designers of Othello.&#10;&#10;Overturn sports a modular board that changes with every game. It's kind of like a &quot;find the hidden word&quot; puzzles you used to play in the newspaper. Each player places colored rings over letters to make words. If you use the rings already placed by your opponent, you may turn the rings over to your color. Winner is the one with the most rings after all the letters have been used, or no more words can be made.&#10;&#10;Essentially Othello with words.&#10;&#10;1993 Mensa Select&#10;&#10;";1987;5.95978;1.6;2;2;10;8;Puzzle, Word Game

The object is for each player to collect all the necessary items of their nationality and land on the winners square. (players need to get a codebook, disguise, key, and password) However, if an opponent guesses your identity before you win, you are out. If they incorrectly guess, then THEY are out.

1987;Emperor of China;"In this highly abstract strategic wargame, you are trying to conquer China by being the first to occupy fifteen provinces at the completion of a complete round of play (all players having had an equal number of turns).  Alternatively, the game can be timed and scored.&#10;&#10;You start with a small number of provinces under your control.  Population counters of your colour indicate this; if a province has extra population, it can move some into an adjacent unoccupied province --this is the simplest way of conquest.  Merger, diplomacy and force (Risk-like combat) are your other options.  Each turn you draw a Yin card and a Yang card.  Yin is bad, Yang is good.  Without looking at either card's instructions, you assign them to two of your provinces.  Yang will most likely increase your recruitment (which is normally three population per turn), but could also give you the capability to cross a natural barrier like a mountain range.  Yin will hurt you.  Some cards you end up holding in your hand.&#10;&#10;A player may attempt to convince another player to merge with his empire.  If the second player agrees then the smaller empire is absorbed by the larger and both players continue play as senior (larger) and junior (smaller) partners.  The absorbed empire no longer has a separate turn nor separate recruitment.  This concept of &quot;shared victory&quot; is intriguing, particularly with a larger number of players.&#10;&#10;The game allows any number of players but components are only provided for five.&#10;&#10;";1972;5.98644;2.0476;2;5;60;10;Ancient, Negotiation, Wargame

1989;The Peter Principle Game;"This game was published in the wake of the best-selling success of Dr. Peter's book &quot;The Peter Principle&quot; (oft-quoted as &quot;In a hierarchy, every employee tends to rise to his or her level of incompetence&quot;). In it, the players, employees of a huge corporation, compete to avoid promotion and remain competent (by taking more &quot;right&quot; decisions than &quot;wrong&quot; ones). At the same time, each tries to force the others into promotion or into &quot;deadwood&quot; status (which happens by accumulating enough wrong decisions and being found out). The last player still alive and competent is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;The game was originally published by Skor-Mor in 1973, but the 1981 AH edition is much easier to find.&#10;&#10;Skor-Mor published 3D puzzles and games in clear plastic such as Chess in the Third Dimension and a 3D Tic-Tac-Toe called Trinary. It disappeared in the early 1980s.&#10;&#10;A related game, theme-wise, is AH's Bureaucracy.&#10;&#10;";1973;4.07234;1.4;2;4;60;12;Humor

Each turn, you try to attract foreign investment and to weather the ups and downs of the economy.  If you are a federalist, you join your board piece with other federalists'; otherwise, you &quot;separate&quot;.  Going separately increases the benefits when they happen, but makes it a lot harder to survive the bad turns of events.  Each player can make &quot;demands&quot; for concessions every turn --according to his own agenda-- which, if pushed for too hard, run the risk of seeing him expelled from the confederation.

With your ELECTRONIC CRIME SCANNER you can eavesdrop on the thief whenever he moves on the board.  You can hear him in the act of committing a crime.  You hear him, too, as he opens a door, crosses a floor, breaks a window, runs on the street and escapes on the subway.  Each sound you hear is a clue that will help you track him down.  You&rsquo;ll need all your skills of deduction and logic to follow the thief and corner him.  Then you can call the police.  With luck, the police will arrest the thief and cart him off to jail.  Sometimes, though, he escapes from them.  At other times, he&rsquo;s just not where you think he is!  If you can catch this thief, you&rsquo;ll earn a large reward.  If he gives you the slip, he&rsquo;ll rob again&hellip;and again&hellip;and again&hellip;&#10;&#10;Features&#10;&#10;&#10;     On the board are 19 different locations where the thief can commit a crime&#10;     If you need another clue, a hot tip or some extra cash, play the appropriate Sleuth Card on your turn.&#10;     To earn a reward, you&rsquo;ll have to arrest the thief before one of your opponents does.&#10;     Add $100 to the reward for each additional crime that the thief commits.&#10;     The winner of the game is the first detective to earn $2500 in reward money.&#10;&#10;&#10;Track and arrest the thief with the ELECTRONIC CRIME SCANNER&#10;&#10;&#10;     Use this powerful computer to track the escaping thief.&#10;     Follow the thief with electronic sound effects.

1993;Troke;"The sub-title for Troke is &quot;Castle Checkers&quot;.&#10;&#10;Abstract strategy game where players move three different kinds of pieces (tower, wall, and moat) across a board diagonally forward, straight ahead or sideways, but never backwards.  In some versions of the game, points are scored for capturing opponent's pieces and by forming complete &quot;castles&quot; (a tower, wall, and moat) on the player's goal line.  Otherwise it is a race to see who can get all their pieces to goal line. A feature of the game is that if you merge with one or two different pieces you take one or two extra moves.  You are allowed to merge (capture) with opponent&rsquo;s pieces and thus move them away from their goal and towards your own. Making moves becomes complicated as the game progresses because capturing pieces requires that additional moves be made. If these extra moves can not be made, then the original capture move can not be made.&#10;&#10;";1956;6.10313;2.125;2;4;30;10;Abstract Strategy

1996;Face Off;"A slapstick game of hockey management (endorsed by Howie Meeker, a Canadian hockey personality of the time).&#10;&#10;Everybody knows that professional hockey game is won or lost on the ice, right?  Wrong.  The game that starts when the referee's whistle sounds is only half the story.  See that character on the end clutching the bankroll?  He's the team manager.  What you don't get to see is the game HE plays-and it's every bit as tough as the one on the ice.  Now's your chance to get the inside story.  In Face Off, you manage your own hockey franchise.  That means you have to scramble for league Superstars, trade players, and try to put together the strongest team you can --without running out of cash.  It means you have to cope with temperamental players, broken contracts, and unexpected expenses.&#10;&#10;Of course, you get to manage your team through a season of hockey games, to see how your planning and conniving pays off!  And who wins the playoffs?  Usually the strongest team --but it's up to you to make it that way.&#10;&#10;This game deserves to be better known; the theme is rather under-exploited and Waddingtons' treatment hits just the right tongue-in-cheek note here.  If you liked Avalon Hill's Slapshot, you'll like Face Off.

2007;Votum;"from the game rules translation&#10;&#10;A true-to-life game about election victories and majorities &#10;for 4 to 6 players.&#10;The unique game VOTUM allows you to play the exciting role of a party leader, who might belong to the generation of the grandsons of the present-day greats. &#10;Votum is a fast and talkative, sometimes loud and often clever game: it requires decisive bargaining, a little luck, and, above all, else the gift of negotiation. &#10;Each player is responsible as the trustworthy chairman of a political party, whom he leads through three legislative sessions, that is, game rounds. During each session, five elections take place followed by the formation of the government. The goal is to advance as far as possible in the parliament. Advancement comes, on the one hand, through luck (namely, your cards) and the way you use it, that is, playing the right cards at the right time, and, on the other hand, through skillful negotiation with your fellow players about posts and their related points. &#10;Success is measured in points. Each player has a sixth of the game field (the plenary hall) in front of him, his points are marked in the track of his color. After 15 elections, the strongest party-chairman wins; that is, the one with the most points.&#10;&#10;";1987;2.89474;2.0;4;6;0;14;Political

Many of the mechanics are similar to that of one of TSR's other wargames (Red Storm Rising) so players of that game can rather easily go to this game.&#10;&#10;Two versions of this game are played. With less than 5 players, the game is a &quot;Basic Game&quot; where military might is what wins the game. Players take sides, usually a combination of Middle Eastern nations plus the US. In the two player version, for instance, it is (quite predictably) the US &amp; Allies vs. Iraq; in the three-player game &quot;Holy War&quot;, it's Israel vs. Iraq (and Yemen and Jordan) vs. Saudi Arabia (and Syria, Libya, and Lebanon), and so on.&#10;&#10;Combat rules are rather straightforward, and wargamers will be familiar with many of the mechanics. Land (w/ infantry, Iraqi National Guard, and tanks), sea, and air units are all utilized. Most units can take a few hits before removed from the board.&#10;&#10;The *real* game, though, is the six-player diplomatic game. The players are now clearly defined: The US (NATO), Iran, Israel, Iraq/Yemen, Moderate Arabs (Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Kuwait, etc.), and Volatile Arabs (Jordan, Libya, etc.) This adds a crucial element of diplomacy and politics, and makes the game much more interesting than the normal wargaming stuff. A &quot;War Fever&quot; and &quot;Jihad&quot; marker change as nations do things--for instance, the first time a US unit is attacked outside of Turkey, War Fever &quot;tripwires&quot; to 10. If Israel attacks a neighbor, Jihad increases by 2. War Fever and Jihad permit certain things to happen--for instance, if War Fever gets too low, the US is restricted in whom they may attack. If Jihad hits either 1 or 10, revolutions may occur--which can switch entire nations to another player!&#10;&#10;Messages can be sent to other players via a diplomatic pouch--you cannot simply pull another player to the side and whisper in their ear. All messages, once read, go into a big pouch, and players can make diplomatic gestures to read some of the messages after they're read.&#10;&#10;Victory occurs, in any case, when you meet objectives, which can vary from player to player. &quot;War Aim&quot; chits are drawn before the game begins, and so players are not quite certain as to exactly what other players are going for. For Instance, Iraq may win if they capture and hold Kuwait for the last three turns; if Jihad has reached 10 at least once and 10 non-Muslim units have been destroyed (by anyone); or by controlling three more oil fields than they started with. It all depends on what they looked for.&#10;&#10;All in all, the Diplomatic game changes the basic game so much that political considerations are as important as military ones.&#10;&#10;A simplified version of the game with the same name appeared in the TSR comic Warhawks #3. Advanced scenarions for the game in the comic appeared in Warhawks #4.&#10;&#10;";1991;5.97215;2.7667;2;6;180;10;Modern Warfare, Political, Wargame
2063;The Great Khan Game;"The Great Khan Game includes one 32-page rule book, one 11&quot; x 17&quot; full-color map of the Whamite Isles, 120 die-cut cardboard playing pieces, 162 playing cards, and one plastic storage bag.&#10;&#10;This is a card/strategy board game for 2 or more players.  The game is set in the Whamite Islands.  It is a very fun game, which usually lasts an hour or so depending on the number players and chance.&#10;&#10;The idea of the game is to make as much gold as possible by controlling countries within your own little empire from the dozen or so provinces available.  The game uses a card system with a lot of clever design tricks added on to provide depth.&#10;&#10;The game play within your turn is easy to pick up, but requires much thought to get right. You are dealt six cards initially, which will usually give you weak control of a couple of countries. These can be added to each turn by drawing two free cards or taking the top card from the discard pile. Additionally, you can buy extra cards every turn.  Having checked the cards for events and acted on those immediately, you can make 'melds,' war and political manoeuvres before compulsorily discarding one card.&#10;&#10;The heart of the game is the 'meld.' A meld is simply the act of laying one or more cards from your hand in front of you, thus activating their powers. By having the most powerful political meld on the table (determined by the total number of flags on the melded cards), you control that country until toppled by better politics or combat. Each country normally has a couple of leaders, often with low numbers, and a varying number of higher-numbered followers who might be loyal to any leader card or just one.&#10;&#10;Power can be stolen in two ways: political coups where you lay more flag cards than are currently melded (you take over those cards as well - those willing rally to your cause), or by the time-honoured invasion force.&#10;&#10;Combat is simple enough, but can prove a little fiddly at times. Once battle is joined, a d6 is rolled to see how many rounds the battle will last. Rolling a one when there are two large armies will virtually guarantee a non-result, whereas a six will give both sides a good chance of a win. Swords kill simply on a roll of five or six, castles get to 'fight' in defence, and defending ships must be beaten first.&#10;&#10;The game has an excellent basic structure.  The key to the game is the balance of military, political power, and wealth.  It really works well.  But, as always, there are improvements to be made and rules that can be changed to improve or change the flavor of the game.  But, the reason why the game works well is that there is an excellent structure underlying the few contested rules.&#10;&#10;It's worth adding that a lot of the fun comes from the irreverent humour on the cards--just in case you thought you were playing a serious strategy game.  Names are satirical, silly, or obtuse references to real world people, places or events.  For example, there's a castle named &quot;Ratlarbig&quot; (look at it closely), a character called the &quot;Sorcerer's Apprentice&quot; and a group of soldiers called &quot;The Bloody Buggers&quot;. It's a hoot whether you're winning or losing.&#10;&#10;";1989;6.71132;2.1163;2;6;90;10;Bluffing, Card Game, Fantasy, Humor
2065;Shogi;"Of Japanese origins, Shogi is played on a 9 by 9 board, and the object is to capture the opponent's king. There are two main differences with Western chess. First, not only pawns but almost every piece can promote if it reaches the opponents three last rows. Second and most distinctive characteristic is that captured pieces become property of the capturing player and during his turn he can &quot;parachute&quot; or &quot;drop&quot; them back to the board instead of performing a normal move. Because of this feature, similar to Bughouse, the game can last longer than a Chess game, the board generally stays fairly crowded and there is no simplification going into the endgame. However, the endgame is typically more rapid with many possibilities for attack and ways to achieve a checkmate, which also makes draws/ties very rare.&#10;&#10;According to &quot;A World of Chess&quot; by Jean-Louis Cazaux &amp; Rick Knowlton (2017, ISBN 978-0-7864-9427-9), Bishop, Rook and Drunk Elephant were introduced to the 9x9 Shogi creating Sho Shogi, the immediate predecessor of Shogi, in the middle of the 15th century. Modern Shogi where created with the introduction of the drop rule and the removal of the Drunk Elephant piece in Sho Shogi. This happened between 1567 and 1587 (earliest recording of modern Shogi). The latter date is based upon a picture in the diary of the samurai Matsudaira Ietada, dated 1587, which shows a game identical to the one of today.&#10;&#10;";1587;7.39044;3.7892;2;2;60;8;Abstract Strategy

2073;Sixth Fleet: Modern Naval Combat in the Mediterranean;"Sixth Fleet is a simulation game of near-future combat for control of the Mediterranean Basin.  As commander of the U.S. or Soviet fleet and respective allies, you must form your ships into Task Forces  and attempt to cripple the enemy&rsquo;s capital ships and submarines.  Your limited air assets must be carefully assigned to defensive and offensive missions.  Commando, parachute and amphibious assault units stand at the ready to capture vital objectives.  Most important, you must protect your supply and replenishment ships, or your fleet will be unable to maintain combat momentum.  Sixth Fleet is a comprehensive simulation of the myriad elements involved in future naval confrontation.&#10;&#10;Each 8 hour game turn is broken into 3 distinct phases (sub, surface, and air) and each player takes turns choosing which phase they wish to conduct. Ex. if the US player chooses &quot;Air&quot;, they conduct all bombing, shipping strikes, anti-sub, and interception actions for all their aircraft.&#10;Players also use their units to attempt to &quot;detect&quot; enemy forces so that an attack can be made. Ships and aircraft are always detected once a unit moves close enough to them, but players have to roll to try to detect subs.&#10;Optional rules include nuclear weapons and logistics.&#10;About 14 scenarios are included which range from about 60 minutes (for Introductory Scenarios) to 3 to 6 hours (for Intermediate Scenarios) to 20 or more hours (for the Advanced Scenarios).&#10;&#10;Part of Victory Games Fleet Series.&#10;&#10;";1985;7.02646;3.3333;2;2;360;12;Modern Warfare, Nautical, Wargame

2077;Hell's Highway: Operation Market Garden;"This game is an operational level simulation of the greatest airborne campaign of World War II. In September of 1944, three Allied airborne divisions dropped up to 60 miles behind German lines in Holland to seize and hold a series of roads and bridges until British ground forces could break through the front lines to link up with the paratroopers- to create an open road to the heart of the Third Reich.  Until now, the tragic yet fascinating story of Market-Garden has not been simulated on a level that allows an appreciation of the entire campaign, without bogging down in endless detail.  In Hell's Highway, players trace the leaden movement of XXX Corps along its jammed highway, drop the gallant paratroopers on the key bridges, and launch the unexpected panzers against the grim Arnhem defenders. Three scenarios and numerous deployment options allow players to explore the battle with historical hindsight, or to experience first-hand the confusion of those bloody days.&#10;&#10;Information from the back of the box:&#10;&#10;Two 20&quot; x 28&quot; maps - connected by their short edges to create a long, thin map area&#10;Two countersheets - 520 half-inch counters&#10;1300 meters/hex&#10;Three (3) turns/day&#10;&#10;Complexity - high.&#10;Solitaire suitability - medium.&#10;Number of players - (1 or) 2 players (also recommended for team play)&#10;Playing time - from 5 hours for a short scenario to 25 hours for a complete campaign&#10;&#10;";1983;7.35122;3.6885;1;4;1500;12;Wargame, World War II

Each player maneuvers ground forces that include armor, mech, infantry, airborne, airmobile, and marine units in an effort to control - or deny - key geographical objectives.  Designed to be played in one sitting, NATO combines ease of play with a sophisticated integrated  system of unit differentiation, command and supply structure, air power, force projection, chemical warfare, and tactical nuclear warfare.&#10;&#10;";1983;6.72444;3.2143;2;2;240;12;Modern Warfare, Wargame
2081;The Civil War 1861-1865;"This sprawling rendition of the American Civil War tries to fit in everything, from Grant and Lee down to Indian raids in the Western territories. It also includes the most extensive treatment of naval and riverine warfare of any strategic Civil War game. The map covers the theater of the war from the Eastern seaboard to the middle of Texas at 25 miles per hex. An optional second map extends to New Mexico. There are five turns per year, four of two months each and a four-month Winter turn. Each turn consists of an indefinite number of &quot;pulses&quot; and may last a long, long time. Troops are represented by generic Strength Points (about 5,000 men per SP, or one or two ironclads with escorting naval vessels).&#10;&#10;The key concepts in the game are Theaters, Command Points, Pulses and Leaders.&#10;&#10;&#10;     There are three Theaters: East, West and Trans-Mississippi. Players must prioritize them each turn as primary, secondary and tertiary. These designations are made a turn in advance, requiring a modest degree of foresight. Higher priority Theaters receive larger allocations of Command Points and thus will see more activity.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Command Points are needed to perform most of the game's functions, such as moving SP's, consolidating SP's into Armies, constructing fortifications, adding naval SP's, sacking unwanted generals, etc. Players obtain them by dice rolls at the start of each turn. In addition to CP's assigned to individual theaters, they receive an allotment of &quot;discretionary&quot; CP's that can be used in any Theater. The Union also gets Naval CP's. Additional CP's may be generated during a turn, as noted below.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Each turn is divided into an indefinite number of Pulses. To begin a Pulse, each player rolls two dice. The difference between the results is the number of actions each must take in that Pulse (high roller first). Actions may be used to expend Command Points, to muster SP reinforcements or to bring inew or newly promoted Leaders into play. If the dice rolls are equal, either the turn ends immediately or each player receives additional Command Points. The likelihood of an immediate end rises with the number of tied rolls and is a certainty on the fourth tie. If the turn doesn't end in this fashion, it continues until all Command Points have been used and available reinforcements and Leaders entered.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     While Strength Points are abstract, the game includes more than 60 historical Leaders, who enter play at about the time that they rose to prominence in real life. Each Leader has a rank (one to four stars) and ratings for Initiative, Tactical Combat and Army Command. Many begin at lower ranks and can be promoted. Sherman, for instance, has a single star when he appears but can rise to four. Like Presidents Lincoln and Davis in real life, players don't have absolute control over promotions, nor does every Leader perform better at a higher rank. A Leader's rank determines the number of SP's he can command - up to two for a one star, up to six for higher ranks. Assigning as many SP's as permitted to a Leader (preferably a capable one) is economical, since he can move his entire force by expending Command Points equal to his Initiative. (Lower Initiative numbers are better in this game.) Without Leaders, SP's cost one CP each to move, rendering them all but static. Better yet are Armies, which can be as large as 25 SP's and must be commanded by a three or four star Leader. (Each Army has its own maximum size, based on its historical counterpart.)&#10;&#10;&#10;The game has much more: an elaborate combat resolution procedure, somewhat less elaborate supply rules, a naval system that is a game in itself, cavalry, railroads, militia, neutral states and a chrome-laden option to add the Far West map and Theater.&#10;&#10;Players gain Victory Points primarily by capturing major enemy and neutral cities and winning neutral states to their side. The South also gets VP's for successful commerce raiding and for isolating or capturing Washington, D.C. It wins at once if it captures Washington at a moment when it has more VP's than the North. Otherwise, VP's are checked in November 1864 and April 1865, when the game comes to a definitive end.&#10;&#10;For those who lack time or patience for the full war, scenarios are provided with the historical setups as of the start of 1862, 1863 and 1864.&#10;&#10;The Civil War isn't the biggest game ever produced on that dreadful conflict, but it is certainly among the most ambitious in its scope and degree of detail. Includes 520 counters.&#10;&#10;";1983;7.72836;3.7872;1;2;1200;12;American Civil War, Civil War, Post-Napoleonic, Wargame
2083;Checkers;"Abstract strategy game where players move disc-shaped pieces across an 8 by 8 cross-hatched (&quot;checker&quot;) board. &#10;Pieces only move diagonally, and only one space at a time.  If a player can move one of his pieces so that it jumps over an adjacent piece of their opponent and into an empty space, that player captures the opponent's disc.  Jumping moves must be taken when possible, thereby creating a strategy game where players offer up jumps in exchange for setting up the board so that they jump even more pieces on their turn.  A player wins by removing all of his opponent's pieces from the board or by blocking the opponent so that he has no more moves.&#10;This game, also known as Draughts, is part of the Checkers family.&#10;&#10;The Official Checker Board to be used in tournaments and official matches of associations like international WCDF, ACF, and APCA usually shall be colored of green and off-white (buff). Board squares shall be not less than 2 inches nor more than 2&frac12; inches wide.

2087;Magic Dance;"A memory and strategy game also published by F.X. Schmid under the title Dance of the Witches, this is essentially Pachisi but so that the playing pieces' identities are hidden, and after a while the game gets pretty chaotic with each player trying desperately to remember which of the witches belong to them and not help opponents or hinder themselves by mistake - it's even possible to drive opposing pieces home by driving them into your own base by mistake, in which case they will instantly teleport to the correct one. Also, pieces are not captured - probably because this would mean revealing their identity - but simply jumped back 7 spaces on the track and if that space is occupied, they're jumped back another 7, and so on. It is possible to make any one piece's identity public for a moment though, by rolling a 6, but that 6 cannot then be used for movement also.&#10;&#10;Like Sagaland/Enchanted Forest - which the playing pieces will bring to memory - this is more of a family game than simply a children's game.&#10;&#10;";1988;5.76983;1.4561;3;6;45;8;Bluffing, Children's Game, Deduction, Memory

It is a popular gambling game, but wagering real stakes is by no means necessary to have fun playing.&#10;&#10;The tiles consist of three suits numbering 1-9 (Dots, Numbers or Characters, and Bamboo, the &quot;Ace&quot; of which almost always looks like a bird), three different dragons (Red, Green, and White [white is unusual in that it may look like a silvery dragon, or like a picture frame, or blank - think &quot;White dragon in a snowstorm&quot;), and the four winds (east, south, west, and north).  There are four copies of each tile.  This totals to 136 tiles. In addition, special Flower, Season, and Joker (American version) tiles may also be used.&#10;&#10;Four players take turns drawing from a stock (the wall), or from the other players' discards, in an attempt to form sets of numeric sequences (e.g., 5-6-7 of the same suit, which can only be drawn from the player at one's left, by calling &quot;Chow&quot;), triplets and quadruplets (which can be drawn from the discards out-of-turn by calling &quot;Pung&quot;), pairs, and other patterns. &quot;Pung&quot; takes precedence over &quot;Chow&quot;, and &quot;Mah Jongg&quot; takes precedence over all (and is the only situation one may draw &quot;Chow&quot; out-of-turn.) What happens if a single discard would give two (or more!) players &quot;Mah Jongg&quot;? Precedence goes to the player who would play next in normal sequence.&#10;&#10;Originating in China in the mid-19th century, it was introduced to the U.S. in the 1920s.  It is now played in different forms throughout Asia, Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand.

2115;Free Parking;"Using the theme of the Free Parking space in Monopoly, this game is a easy to learn card game.  Each player has a parking meter which they can add time to by playing Feed the Meter cards.  They then can play errand or Point cards, like visit the health club or renew your driver's license.&#10;&#10;Special cards allow you to affect the play of others and the second chance cards are a random good or bad effect.&#10;&#10;The first player to score 200 or more points is the winner.&#10;&#10;This game has a Mille Bourne type feel to it.&#10;&#10;";1988;5.2668;1.1071;2;4;30;8;Card Game, Transportation

2119;221B Baker St.: Sherlock Holmes & the Time Machine;"This is the newest edition of the 221B Baker St. game, and the gameplay is nearly identical to the original. Twenty &quot;all-new, all-true&quot; mysteries of the 20th century include:&#10;&#10;     The JFK assassination in &quot;The Camelot Conspiracy, Pt. I and II&quot;&#10;     Jimmy Hoffa's disappearance in &quot;The Vanishing Teamster&quot;&#10;     Elvis's death in &quot;The King's Early Exit&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;221B Baker Street is the London address of the world's most celebrated fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes, and his dedicated companion, Dr. Watson. However, instead of staying in London, in this version players use H. G. Wells' Time Machine to travel to the future, attempting to solve infamous cases from the 20th Century.&#10;&#10;Each player assumes the role of Holmes and matches wits with the other players to determine who possesses the most skillful powers of deduction. The game includes 20 cases based on famous crimes and criminals of the 20th Century, including the Zodiac Killer, Sacco and Vanzetti, the Lindbergh Kidnapping, and &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot;. Each case is represented by a card that features a crime told in story form, a selection of probable suspects and a list of locations involved in that crime.&#10;&#10;The board represents the various cities the crimes occurred in, with eighteen generic locations to find clues (Pharmacy, Hotel, Airport, Supermarket, Tavern, Harbor, FBI, etc.). Players must collect clues from different locations, noting them down on their checklists as they attempt to find the answers to the questions listed on the case card. Movement is via die roll.&#10;&#10;Naturally, the crime scene will often contain vital clues, and a prudent detective always checks with the neighbors. Still, you can learn something important almost anywhere in town. The first player to figure out the correct answers to a particular mystery or crime, return to the Time Machine and announce the solution, is the winner.&#10;&#10;There are two versions of this edition: Standard and Deluxe. The Standard version uses regular movers, while the Deluxe version includes six &quot;collectible&quot; pewter playing pieces: Deerstalker Cap, Time Machine, Dark Lantern, Magnifying Glass, Violin, Pipe.&#10;&#10;";1996;5.80477;2.0;2;6;45;12;Deduction, Murder / Mystery, Novel-based
2121;The Sword and the Stars;"Sword and the Stars sets the stage for interstellar conflict between vying empires on such a scale (the map depicts about 1/4 of a spiral galaxy) that individual ships and even fleets become insignificant. You pay for and resolve entire interstellar campaigns with cards representing massive scale investment of manpower and resources over 4 Earth years of operations, each player round representing the passage of 20 years. Players direct the fate of interstellar empires through expansion or consolidation by means of conquests, raids, governing, building planetary defenses, commerce, and diplomacy.&#10;&#10;The game was derived from two existing popular SPI titles. While adding many subtle changes in its own right, it combines the highly successful system used in Empires of the Middle Ages with the graphic layout used for Freedom in the Galaxy. Technology and economics are abstracted, but both play a large role in just about every aspect of the game. Stargates allow players to conduct interstellar operations against any star system, free of range constraints. This means that in an interstellar war, nowhere is safe from your enemies.&#10;&#10;Includes a mechanism for a sort of Galactic Security Council, where players can scheme all sorts of mischief against each other.&#10;&#10;Ten scenarios (including the &quot;Galactic Cycle&quot; campaign game) are supplied. A &quot;short&quot; game will depict a period lasting about 200 years, while for the long &quot;grand campaign&quot; scenario it is recommended to play &quot;at least&quot; 1000 years. The Sword and the Stars is more compact than Empires. Includes 400 counters, 56 year cards, a 17 x 22&quot; map depicting a total of 42 star systems. Maximum 5 players (3-4 recommended).&#10;&#10;Historical Note:&#10;Writing about SPI's Empires of the Middle Ages (q.v.), editor Kula included a sidebar quote from Redmond Simonsen to the effect that &quot;a good number of people...would really enjoy the game if they'd just imagine that it's a science fictional or fantastic continent instead of Europe&quot;. Well, in 1981, the year after Empires of the Middle Ages was released, SPI produced another game using the same system and the missing science fiction premise, and The Sword and the Stars was born.&#10;&#10;";1981;6.32792;3.0526;1;5;240;12;Civilization, Economic, Political, Science Fiction, Wargame
2123;Shadowrun: The Trading Card Game;"This game takes fantasy with magic, elves, dwarves, orcs, trolls etc., and puts them in a cyberpunk world 60 years in the future.&#10;&#10;There are 7 types of cards...&#10;&#10;&#10;    Runners - You collect groups of these characters and use them to make runs on objectives.  Some of these can  support the group through computers while staying safe at home.  These cards have symbols on them that represent their abilities and these are use to bypass threats without actually having to face them.&#10;    Objectives - These are what you are making runs on.  They are worth reputation points and usually have a task that you must best or a number of symbols that you have to match with the symbols on your runners.&#10;    Challenge - You assign these to the objectives as additional hurdles that you have to get by before you can tackle the objective.  Usually you can overcome them with the right symbols but if not they can represent nasty things you will have to fight or things that will just hurt you.&#10;    Gear - This is stuff that you assign to runners to help them make runs.  Some gear requires you to have a runner with a matching symbol.&#10;    Locations - These represent places that you control and can help you in various ways.&#10;    Contacts - These represent people that will help you. &#10;    Specials - These are instants that you play to affect the current situation.&#10;&#10;&#10;Everything is driven by money which is hard to come by.  It costs money to acquire almost every card and a lot of cards require money spent just to keep them in play or every time you use them.&#10;&#10;";1997;6.46493;2.7273;2;8;60;12;Card Game, Collectible Components, Fantasy, Fighting, Science Fiction
2125;Amazons;"The game is played on a square grid, usually 10 by 10.  Each player starts with four amazons (which move as chess queens, but do not capture) placed in predetermined locations on their side of the board.  On a player turn, he moves one amazon and then fires an arrow from the arrival position. Firing an arrow consists in placing a new arrow piece on the board; also the arrow moves like a queen from the position it is fired. The landed arrow doesn't move anymore and creates a permanent block on the board. Arrows can not be passed through by either amazons or other arrows.  The first player who can not make a legal move (move and then shoot) loses the game.&#10;&#10;";1992;7.20454;2.8125;2;2;30;12;Abstract Strategy
2127;Overpower;"This defunct CCG is primarily based on characters from Marvel comics, with DC and Image comics represented in later expansions.&#10;&#10;Each player has a team of 4 characters, each rated in 3 or 4 skill types. At the beginning of each hand, each player makes a wager of some of their 7 mission cards based on how confident they are that they can &quot;win&quot; the hand by causing the most damage. Players then take turns playing a card from their hand or cards set aside from previous hands. Cards include Power cards (basic attack or defense in a skill type), Universe cards (e.g., a city bus, which adds value to a Strength attack), Special cards (usually character specific with varying effects), and more in later expansions. At the end of each hand, the damage from that hand is totaled; the player who caused the most &quot;completes&quot; their wagered missions, while the other player is &quot;defeated&quot; with those missions. Players may concede a hand instead of playing a card, losing their missions but avoiding further damage&#10;&#10;A player wins when they have knocked out all 4 opposing characters, &quot;completed&quot; all of their missions, or their opponent is &quot;defeated&quot; in all missions. (There is also a basic game option without the use of missions or conceding, in which the sole victory condition is knocking out the opposing team.)&#10;&#10;";1995;5.73537;1.8684;2;2;30;10;Card Game, Collectible Components, Comic Book / Strip, Fantasy, Fighting

2133;Rage;"Publisher Blurb&#10;These are the last days. Gaia is dying. The Apocalypse is here.&#10;&#10;Will you fall defending her or die a cowards death? Will your pack live in legend as the ones who saved the world, or those who betrayed it?&#10;&#10;Is today a good day to die?&#10;&#10;Take control of a pack of Garou, savage werewolves, as they battle the forces of the Wyrm in defense of Mother Earth, Gaia.&#10;&#10;Call upon ancient spirit pacts, mystical abilities, and the tools of the modern world to destroy the forces of corruption that threaton to plunge the world into eternal darkness and decay.&#10;&#10;But not every Garou agrees how best to save Gaia. Is it best done through force? Through renewing the traditions and spirit pacts of old? Through mystical means? Or should the Garou just adapt to the new age and help Gaia change to fit into the new world?&#10;&#10;Or sell out and play a pack of Wyrm creatures hell bent on seeing that the Wyrm is the final victor in the coming Apocalypse.&#10;&#10;But not even the forces of the Wyrm can agree on their methods. Should they concentrate on corrupting humans and Garou to do the Wyrm's bidding? Should they fight the Garou claw to claw? Or should they win the war by destroying every last thing the Garou love and cherish?&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;Each player has two decks. One deck is his &quot;Sept&quot; hand.  This is composed of allies, equipment, fetishes, events, victims, gifts, quests, and several other card types depending on which expansions you are using.  The other deck is a combat deck showing special maneuvers which are used when two characters are engaged in combat.&#10;&#10;Play begins with each player laying out his pack (collection of Character cards).  These are all the characters the player will have for that game.  The game ends when one pack achieves the same number of Renown as they had starting Renown.  Typically, players start with a 20 Renown pack (each character has a Renown) and thus the game ends when someone has 20 renown in their victory pile.&#10;&#10;Play is simultaneous, with all players taking actions at the same time - conflicts are generally resolved based on the renown of the character taking an action; well known characters go first.  The game is split into several phases:&#10;Redraw - draw your Sept hand back to 5 cards&#10;Regeneration - heal characters that have been hurt&#10;Resource - play most cards like gifts, equipment etc.&#10;Umbra - play special umbra cards and actions&#10;Moot - play special cards which may change rules. These must be voted on by all players.&#10;Combat - resolve any fights.&#10;&#10;Each round a player designates one of his characters as Alpha.  The Alpha becomes the primary actor for that round.  During the combat round, Alphas may:&#10;1) Attack another Alpha&#10;2) Attack a victim&#10;3) Attack an enemy&#10;4) Challenge an ally or a non-Alpha character&#10;5) Attack a territory&#10;6) Do nothing.&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved using a separate deck which allows special maneuvers.&#10;&#10;Renown (victory points) are earned by defeating rival characters and enemies. Some packs may reverse the rules and gain victory by defeating victims.  Renown can also be earned from moots and quests.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.1219;2.3864;2;6;45;12;Card Game, Collectible Components, Fighting, Horror
2135;On the Edge;"On the Edge is a card game based on the Over the Edge RPG setting. It was one of the earliest to jump on the Magic/collectible bandwagon.  To their credit they did create a game that was very unlike Magic in play and flavor. The card types are:&#10;&#10;Characters - These are your soldiers and they are laid out in a grid that is a maximum of three deep.  You can only attack or defend with the first untapped character in each row (with exceptions of course).  Some characters also generate Pull points.  These are used like money to bring cards in play or to generate influence which is needed to win so they of course must be protected.&#10;&#10;Resources - These generate Pull for bringing cards into play.  Pull generated from resources can not be used to generate influence.&#10;&#10;Whammy - These are instants that you can play anytime.&#10;&#10;Gear - These are items you can assign to characters.&#10;&#10;Condition - These are assigned to characters and can have positive or negative affects.&#10;&#10;Environmental - These cards affect the game as a whole.&#10;&#10;Secrets - These usually affect cards from specific conspiracies.&#10;&#10;The game is generally played by putting your big hitters in your front row, your big defenders in your second row and your pull generators in your last row.  First player to generate a predetermined amount of influence wins.&#10;&#10;The art on the cards is very strange and different people either love or despise.&#10;&#10;";1994;6.29387;2.3913;2;5;45;12;Card Game, Collectible Components, Fighting

2155;Agent of Change;"Agent of Change is the rail game of West Virginia, pitting the players against the mountains and each other.  The object of the game is to link the Great East Coast Cities to the Ohio River and amass $250 million first.  This game is very similar to the standard Mayfair Empire Builder games except that it was a limited edition game for the Huntington Museum of Art as part of their exhibit entitled &quot;Agent of Change: The Railroad in West Virginia&quot;.  Aspects of this game that makes it different than the other Mayfair crayon games is the use of the load sheet, the ability to build coal mines, and the extremely mountainous terrain.  Instead of load cards, the game uses two dice and a load sheet where the player rolls dice and reference the master load sheet to determine the available contracts.  Building coal mines involves building rails through coal mine spaces which causes a load of coal to be available at the nearest coal city.  Since West Virginia is naturally mountainous, the competition for the best routes is extremely competitive, even in a two-player game.&#10;&#10;";1991;5.27273;3.0;2;4;90;12;Trains
2157;Riddle of the Ring;"In this fairly simple game based on The Lord of the Rings, you play one of four Hobbits or one of four Black Riders.

A Black Rider player wins if he can get the ring to Barad-Dur and survive for one turn.&#10;&#10;There is a map of Middle Earth but this is a card driven game.  The map generally hinders movement and supplies places to draw cards.  Cards can be tools to help you fight or move through types of terrain at a reduced cost.&#10;&#10;A players turn consists of moving, having Friendly Exchanges, executing Power Plays, and drawing cards.  Power Plays include looking at other player&rsquo;s hands, taking cards from another player, and/or executing a battle against another player.&#10;&#10;Though game play is simple and fast, strategies and subtleties of play are not always obvious and requires intelligent play through good timing in movement, using cards effectively, and especially having Friendly Exchanges and Power Plays in combinations to achieve maximum advantage.&#10;&#10;Optional rules include playing as partners (Hobbits vs. Black Riders) and the enhanced two-player game where one player controls all four Hobbits and the other player controls all four Black Riders.&#10;&#10;";1982;6.90418;2.1176;2;8;120;13;Adventure, Fantasy, Novel-based

The middle nine squares comprise a large box with four entrances.  The goal of the game is to get all four of your pawns into the middle box (home).  In front of each entrance are fences that are set into the slots.&#10;&#10;On your turn you may remove one of your fences and place it in any slot on the board.  You then roll two dice and move one of your pawns the total or two of your pawns, each the amount of one of the dice.  Once a pawn starts moving it may not change direction unless it hits a wall or fence.  Upon hitting either the pawn moves at a 90 degree angle from the obstacle.  If you land on an opposing piece by exact count you send it back to any of the start boxes.  If you roll doubles you may take one piece and jump an adjoining fence instead of a move.

It has a relatively simple rule-set (compared to Warhammer 40K itself) and is known for its fast play and immersive theme (think the movie Aliens).&#10;&#10;You lay out corridors and rooms that represent a space hulk, a large disabled ship floating in space. The Space Marines wear powerful space battle suits and carry heavy weaponry. The Genestealers (reminiscent of the alien in Alien) are naked, except for their quick movement, multiple clawed arms capable of ripping through Terminator armor and their seemingly endless numbers.&#10;&#10;Each game is played as a scenario.  The Space Marines win by completing a certain goal, such as retrieving an artifact and escaping alive.  The Genestealers win by stopping the Space Marines from achieving their goal, usually by killing them all. A unique mechanism is that the Genestealers have no time limit for their turn, but the Space Marines have a 3 minute time limit, and less if a sergeant is killed. This simulates the fact that Genestealers move so much quicker and adds a lot of tension to the game for the Marine player.&#10;&#10;The miniatures are excellent although you do have to paint them yourselves and the modular board is very well done.&#10;&#10;The Deathwing Expansion adds new personnel, weapons, rules for multilevel hulks, new missions and a mission generator along with some complexity.&#10;&#10;The Genestealer Expansion adds new marines, weapons, Genestealer Hybrids who can use weapons and new missions. There are also rules for psychic powers.&#10;&#10;There was also the Space Hulk Campaign Book  that can be linked for longer games. This book also added rules for traitor Marines and new weapons.&#10;&#10;Even with all rules in place the game does not get too complicated and is a very good introduction to Warhammer 40K.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;Space Hulk (2nd Edition)&#10;Space Hulk (3rd Edition)&#10;Space Hulk (4th Edition)&#10;&#10;";1989;7.49043;2.5;2;2;45;12;Fighting, Miniatures, Science Fiction, Wargame

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Pok&eacute;mon is a Collectible Card Games based upon Japanese anime that have found success internationally, and is one of the longest surviving CCGs currently available. Pok&eacute;mon was one of the first Collectible Card Games to offer any competition to the market dominance of Magic:  The Gathering.&#10;&#10;Many people who buy the product often do not play the game, choosing instead to collect their favorite characters from the franchise the game is based upon.&#10;&#10;Each player plays the role of a Pok&eacute;mon trainer that use their Pok&eacute;mon creatures to battle the Pok&eacute;mon creatures of the other Pok&eacute;mon trainer.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to play your Pok&eacute;mon cards, that represent different creatures, and be the first player to &quot;knock out&quot; (defeat) six opposing Pok&eacute;mon.  You play the game with a deck of sixty cards that include your Pok&eacute;mon, as well as Trainer cards and Energy cards.  Trainer cards affect the game, players, or Pok&eacute;mon in different ways, most of them temporary, while Energy cards act as the resources in the game.&#10;&#10;You start the game by drawing seven cards to your hand.  Each player picks a Basic Pok&eacute;mon from their hand and places it in front of them to start.  This is called the Active Pok&eacute;mon and is the one currently dueling.  Players can also place other Basic Pok&eacute;mon to fill up the five slots on their &quot;Bench&quot;.  Six cards are then set aside to act as Prize cards.  Each time you defeat one of your opponent's Pok&eacute;mon, you get to draw one of these Prize cards.&#10;&#10;Players take alternating turns during which they can:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Draw a card from their deck to their hand&#10;     Play Actions:&#10;         Put Basic Pok&eacute;mon in play from their hand to their Bench&#10;         Evolve their Pok&eacute;mon&#10;         Attach an Energy card to one of their Pok&eacute;mon (once per turn)&#10;         Play Trainer cards (Only 1 Stadium card and 1 Supporter card per turn)&#10;         Retreat their Active Pok&eacute;mon (once per turn - trade places with one on the Bench (usually at the cost of Energy cards))&#10;         Use Abilities&#10;    &#10;     Attack&#10;&#10;&#10;In addition to Basic Pok&eacute;mon cards, there are also Evolution cards, which depict evolved forms of Basic Pok&eacute;mon (or sometimes other Evolved Pok&eacute;mon). A player can evolve a Pok&eacute;mon by laying a corresponding Evolution card onto another Pok&eacute;mon card in play.  This can only be done once per turn per Pok&eacute;mon, and only if the Pok&eacute;mon has been in play at least one entire turn.  The Evolved Pok&eacute;mon retains any damage and Energy cards, but loses any Special Conditions affecting it, and the card text completely replaces the previous card.&#10;&#10;The last action a player takes during their turn, if they choose, is to have their Active Pok&eacute;mon use one of its abilities to attack the other player's Active Pok&eacute;mon.  Attacks can only be used if the Pok&eacute;mon has enough Energy cards of the right type attached to it to meet the requirements for the attack; each attack has different requirements and effects that are listed on the card.  Most attacks will do some amount of damage to the Defending Pok&eacute;mon; if defeated, the Defending Pok&eacute;mon is replaced with another Pok&eacute;mon from the Bench, and the attacker draws a Prize card.  If either the attacker draws their last Prize card or the Defender cannot replace the Active Pok&eacute;mon (due to an empty Bench), the attacker has won the game.&#10;&#10;There are many different varieties of Pok&eacute;mon available and several different forms of each one, each with different attacks, abilities and characteristics, allowing for many different possible outcomes.

2169;Arcadia: The Wyld Hunt;"No starter packs.  &#10;Each booster has the rules. &#10;You only need to buy two boosters to play with.&#10;&#10;From a marketing standpoint this game should have sold well.  You do not have to purchase boxes of cards to play.  You buy a character pack and a story pack then find someone else who has done the same and play.&#10;&#10;In the character pack you will get a character who stands up and all the cards you need to make him unique.  Each character has stats for might, resolve, savvy and combat.  You can add 5 points to spend upgrading your character.  You upgrade with 5 types of cards called merits with varying costs.  Abilities generally boost one of your 4 attributes.  Advantages are special skills available to the character. Allies are friends that travel with you and add their skills to help you.  Arts are magic abilities that help you in various ways.  Treasures are items that you can carry to help you or you can find them in your journeys.  If you want to add more then 5 points to your character you can add flaws which are worth negative points.  If you add 2 points of flaws then you would have seven points of merits you could add.  These come in three flavors.  Curses represent special liabilities of your character.  Enemies represent individuals or races with great hatred for you which if met fight with an advantage.  Weakness usually affect your stats.  Once you have created your character you can go on an adventure.&#10;&#10;In your story pack you will find leagues which are put together to create a map. Each league has a terrain type or types, cost to enter or leave, special affects and what attribute you may recover if resting there.  In your story pack you will also find quest cards.  The quest card tells you what you are trying to achieve.  Each quest has four attributes.  These are Experience points received when the quest is achieved, Total points of waylays allowed against the quest, total points in treasures that can be seeded and the victory conditions required to complete the quest.  You will also find waylay cards in your story pack.  These will have indicators on them to tell you in what terrain you are allowed to play them in.  There is a point rating that is applied against the quests waylay rating.  Each waylay also has a test that must be passed.  Failing a waylay can have dire consequences or it may just delay you by one turn.&#10;&#10;It is a very simple game that never plays the same way twice as long as you have a few boosters around to mix things up.&#10;&#10;";1996;5.72006;2.1429;1;5;30;10;Card Game, Collectible Components, Exploration, Fantasy, Fighting

2173;4 Player Chess;"Four-Player Chess (Four-handed chess, Chess-4, and 4-Chess) is often credited to Capt Charles Verney, who was the first known to have documented the game in England in 1881.  Four-player versions of chess probably have existed for hundreds of years prior to Verney in one form or another.  Verney's four-player board consists of three rows added to each side of a standard 2-player board, and four complete sets of chessmen in four different colors.  Modern four-player boards and colored pieces are available from several manufacturers.&#10;&#10;In Verney's version (1881), 4 player chess was a partnership game, and the object was to checkmate both opposing partners at the same time.  In modern variants, four player games can range from partners, to cutthroat (every player for himself), to temporary alliances at will.&#10;&#10;Starting configuration affects fairness (bias).  The standard 2-player configuration of queen facing queen is biased in four player chess because there is only one axis of symmetry.  Four player chess requires two axes of symmetry to be fair (unbiased).  To avoid bias, Verney recommended a staring configuration of all queens on light (or all on dark) squares.  Another unbiased starting configuration is all queens on the right (or all on the left) of the king.&#10;&#10;For the most part, four player chess follows (or can follow) all the normal rules of two-player chess.  Verney had special rules for partnership playing, disallowed castling, and pawns had to make it to the enemies last rank in order to be exchanged for another piece.  Pawns could also march up and back down the board.  Verney also had checkmate as the ultimate move.&#10;&#10;In modern variations of four-player chess, partnering may not be required, but allowable, castling can be allowed, and actual capturing of a king a required move to eliminate a player.  The Chess Federation does not recognize four-player chess in any form, and there are no official rules, so players are free to experiment with variations and make their own rules.&#10;&#10;See also:&#10;&#10;        Bughouse Chess&#10;        Vendetta&#10;&#10;&#10;";1881;5.96839;2.8889;2;4;45;8;Abstract Strategy, Children's Game
2175;Willi Wacker;"Willi Wacker, apparently, is the German name for comic-strip character Andy Capp, who provides the theme for this game. Players seek to play same-number or sequential-number sets of cards from their hands to the table (the cards are numbered 1-8). Picture cards add wrinkles such as allowing players to steal cards from the hands or played sets of opponents. Card sets and the points they bring are safe only when the correct picture card - Andy/Willi finally getting a beer - is played.&#10;&#10;";1986;5.5274;1.0;3;6;30;8;Card Game

2179;Musketeers;"From the rules overview: &quot;In the Queen&rsquo;s service, the Musketeers are trying to acquire three valuable gems. However, the Cardinal and his dreaded Guards are out to sabotage the Musketeers&rsquo; mission. Many skirmishes between the Musketeers and the Guards ensue. The most successful Musketeers will be awarded gems. Those who fail will be sent to prison and will remain empty handed.&quot;&#10;&#10;Setup: remove some specific cards depending on the number of players. Shuffle and place all Guard cards in the center, along with the Gem and Prison cards. Shuffle the Musketeer cards and deal 12 each.&#10;&#10;Play: players select 3 cards to place face down; these are their potential rewards (Pay cards) this fight. Reveal the top Guard. Players simultaneously select a card, then reveal. If the sum is lower than the Guard strength, the player playing the lowest card places a Prison card on one of his Pay cards. Otherwise, the player with the highest card either places a Gem card on one of his Pay cards, or returns one of his Prison cards to the center. If center area doesn't have a card you need, take it from another player. If all you have 3 Prison cards, your played card doesn't add to the other players' cards.&#10;&#10;The round ends after 9 fights. Players earn silver for their Pay cards, doubled if a Gem is on top and reduced to 0 if a Prison is on top. The player with the most coins wins. Alternatively, keep playing rounds till someone gets 100 or more points, and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;";1991;6.08045;1.1071;2;4;40;8;Bluffing, Card Game

2181;Bridge;"Bridge is a standard deck, trick taking card game that pits two partnerships against each other. The first part of the game is the auction, by which partners attempt to communicate information about their hands by bidding, in order to arrive at a successful contract. The contract specifies how many tricks must be taken by the team that wins the bid. After the auction, a member of the team that won the bid tries to win as many tricks as possible while playing both hands from the partnership. One hand is played normally while the other (the &quot;dummy hand&quot;) is placed face-up on the table, allowing for greater control. The defenders attempt to take enough tricks to make the contract fail.&#10;&#10;The formal name of the game is Contract Bridge, but the shortened name &quot;Bridge&quot; is the most common usage. Bridge developed from the 17th Century card game Whist. The earliest form of Bridge originated in 1886 when rules were introduced allowing the dealer to choose a trump and their partner's hand to become dummy. Bridge became Auction Bridge in 1904, which allowed the trump suit to be decided by the highest bidding partnership. Harold Vanderbilt transformed Auction Bridge into Contract Bridge in 1925, when he introduced an improved method of scoring.&#10;&#10;The duplicate version of the game has many pairs of partners, each playing the same hands separately and comparing their results. This method removes the element of luck in getting good cards when comparing players and thus helps to isolate the role of skill in the game.&#10;&#10;";1925;7.46137;3.8927;4;4;60;12;Card Game

2190;Star Trek: The Card Game;"This CCG is based on the original series. Each player plays with the same core crew cards in the middle of the table. These cards, Kirk, Spock, McCoy and the Enterprise, are in every starter. This is a blessing in that most CCG's make the most popular characters very rare.&#10;&#10;The game can be multi-player but is designed for and best with only two players.  Each player takes turns being the &quot;Current Player&quot;: the crew of the Enterprise, while the opposing player represents the obstacles to the crew as the &quot;Challenging Player&quot;.&#10;&#10;The game revolves around completing episodes as the Current Player. Each episode is made up of three cards, Mission, Plot and Discovery. You have all three cards in a generic form that you can play if you did not draw one of the types.&#10;&#10;You play a mission card then the opponent plays challenges against it. You then play a plot card and more challenges. Then a discovery card and yep, more challenges (well&hellip; really you just resolve any outstanding challenges). At the end each side gets points called XC for how they did or did not do during the Episode phase.  The Current player gets XC for completing the episode while the Challenger gets XC for stifling the Current Player's efforts.&#10;&#10;XC is put on the core crew and crew you enter on your side and the first player to end their turn with 25+ XC total on the crew wins. This means that XC on the core crew will count for each side when it is their turn.&#10;&#10;The shots from the series used on the cards will make Star Trek fans very happy.

2197;Kensington;"The board is made up of 7 hexes, one in the center and six surrounding.  The hexes are joined by squares along the sides, and the squares are joined by triangles.  The game is played on the intersections where the lines join.  Players play one piece, of their 15, at a time until all pieces are placed, then pieces are moved one at a time from one intersection to another.  If a player has a piece at all three of a triangles points, he can reposition any 1 of his opponent's pieces.  If a player controls all 4 points of a square, then he can reposition 2 of his opponent's pieces.  The object of the game is to control all six points of a hex.&#10;&#10;";1979;5.36015;2.234;2;6;20;7;Abstract Strategy

2201;Redemption;"Redemption(&trade;) is a Bible-based collectible card game (CCG). Created in 1995 by Rob Anderson of Cactus Game Design Inc. as a Christian faith alternative to Magic the Gathering, Redemption (&trade;) is the 2nd-longest running CCG in existence (after Magic). As of 2023, 6 starter sets and 24 expansion sets have been released, along with many promotional cards. There are over 4500 unique Redemption cards in print - including variants and reprints.&#10;&#10;For all of the impressive numbers, what is even more impressive is that every single Redemption card is based on a character, event, or concept from the Bible and has its own identifying Bible verse(s). Moreover, most cards&rsquo; special abilities tie directly into their verse&rsquo;s meaning or topic.&#10;&#10;Going further - the game is a simple-to-learn, complex-to-master strategy game. Unlike most other CCGs, it is 2-sided: each player plays offense and defense, and will build each into their customized deck.&#10;&#10;So how do you play? In a nutshell, the first player to rescue 5 lost souls (in &ldquo;Type 1&rdquo; format, or 7 Lost Souls in Type 2 format) is the winner. Lost Souls are rescued by using Heroes on offense, and strategically overcoming your opponent&rsquo;s defensive villains, called Evil Characters. Each time you do that, you rescue 1 Lost Soul card, and the turn is passed for your opponent to play offense with their Heroes and against your defensive Evil Characters. Hundreds of unique special abilities create endless play combinations and deep strategy, for extremely high replay value for the game. Once you get into Redemption, you&rsquo;ll always enjoy tweaking - or completely scrapping and starting over - decks, acquiring new cards, trying new strategies, and testing yourself against opponents in casual and tournament settings.&#10;&#10;Speaking of tournaments, every year there is a long tournament season, filled with local, district, state, and regional tournaments, as well as a national tournament, that anyone can attend. The national tournament, known within the community as &quot;Nationals&quot;, is usually hosted in the summer months of July or August. This event is a 3 day tournament where every legal category is played to determine a National Champion of that category for the year. Also, at this point, the annual ranking system for players which awards points for top 3 finishes in sanctioned tournaments throughout the year is finalized and the winners are announced. All National winners and winners of a category in the annual ranking system for a category receive special National Winner Promos. These are some of the coolest looking cards in the game and are highly sought after as playable collectibles.&#10;&#10;Though of course far from perfect, being a Christian game in which most players who play are Christians, there is also a wonderful community that has been established over the past 25 years. So many players are welcoming and encouraging to newcomers and veterans alike, and there is an online message board and Discord channel in which conversation goes on daily. This is a community in which players feel just as natural about asking a strategy question about the game as sharing a personal prayer topic - trusting that they will be treated with respect and care no matter what. This active community of Redemption players, which includes the team of Elders (the game's leadership group), have really worked hard to make it about as easy to join the game as can be. There are tremendous community driven resources to provide plenty of engagement with new and active players alike. In addition to the message boards and Discord, the game has an active subreddit, a blog site with contributions from the broad community of players, active Youtubers and even two podcasts - One a weekly source of content spanning various topics of the game and the other a biweekly dive into high level competitive gameplay.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.10428;2.5625;2;5;30;7;Card Game, Collectible Components, Religious
2202;Swahili;"This is a pretty straight forward adaption of Mancala. The three dimensional board is made up of 11 rows (circles) and a middle pit. The first 6 rows are safe and each player has their own along with a pit for prisoners. There are then 5 circular rows that anybody can move into and a pit in the middle for scoring.  To start the game you place 3 pieces on each of your first 4 rows. You pick a row and move all pieces in it, dropping one piece off at every row you pass. If your last piece comes to rest in a row with other of your pieces you may pick them up and move with them also. Upon getting a pawn to the middle pit you drop one in and start placing the pieces starting along row one again. If your last piece ends in a row that an opponent has a single piece in you capture it and place it in your prisoner pit. If more then one opponent has a single piece in the last row you place in you capture all of them.&#10;&#10;When one player has no pieces left, through dropping them in the middle pit or being captured, the game is over. Each piece captured is worth 5 points and each piece in the middle pit is worth 10 points.&#10;&#10;";1968;5.9;1.0;2;4;30;8;Abstract Strategy

2205;The Lost World Jurassic Park Game;"Based on the second movie, of course. This tri-lingual (English, Spanish, French) crowded MB box contains a whole bunch of thin cardboard 3D buildings; stand up cardboard pieces for the 12 humans and the helicopter, and a bunch of plastic miniatures of the dinosaurs (a T-Rex and some Velociraptors). This is played in teams, the human team trying to get 3 humans off the board via the chopper, and the dinosaur team trying to prevent this. When 3 play, the third player alternates teams.&#10;&#10;The humans can jump between building roofs or can run between them. Unfortunately, the dinosaurs move a lot faster on the ground than the humans (the humans move between marked spaces, the dinosaurs between zones). Buildings have several entry/exit points for the humans but only one for the raptors. Dice indicate how to move humans and dinosaurs; one of the dice has Stop/Go markings which control whether you may roll again or not --making movement harder to predict. Jumping (for humans) and entering buildings (for dinosaurs) is also dice controlled. The T-Rex is confined to a single board edge area; its function is to flush the humans from the starting building -- once he reaches it, all remaining humans are devoured!&#10;&#10;Yes, unlike the first movie game, in this one there is death aplenty. As soon as a dinosaur enters a space with humans in it, even when just passing through, they're all eaten. Tastes like chicken.&#10;&#10;An alternate game consists of two plays, with teams switching allegiance. The winning team is then the one that saves the most humans.&#10;&#10;From the same film series:&#10;&#10;    Jurassic Park Game&#10;    Jurassic Park III: Island Survival Game&#10;&#10;&#10;";1996;6.01938;1.5556;2;4;90;8;Movies / TV / Radio theme, Racing, Science Fiction
2206;Jurassic Park Game;"Based on the first movie, of course. This huge Milton Bradley box contains an over-sized board with a rather flimsy Visitor Center building; stand up cardboard pieces for the various movie characters, and a bunch of plastic miniatures of the more dangerous dinosaurs (a T-Rex, Velociraptors, and Dilophosaurus).&#10;You start off at the other end of the island and try to make it to the Visitor Center. There are some safe spaces on the board (maintenance sheds) that allow you to refresh your hand of cards as a bonus. Cards allow you to move, move faster along the road, escape a dinosaur or cancel another player's card. On your turn, you roll dice that indicate which dinosaur you may move. You then move yourself one space, play a card or trade in cards. The dinosaurs don't kill anyone (unlike in the movie!) -- they just pin you down until the dinosaur is moved away or an escape card is played.&#10;&#10;Although the box says 2-4 players, there are pieces for up to 8, which leads to a lot more mayhem (but a longer game).&#10;&#10;";1993;5.26743;1.4167;2;8;60;8;Animals, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Racing, Science Fiction

From the rulebook...&#10;&#10;&quot;They've Invaded Pleasantville&quot; minigame is a two player wargame of secret invasion by Space Invaders.  One player, the Alien player, moves the Alien-controlled and uncontrolled pieces, and the other player, the Town player, moves the Town-controlled pieces.  There are 12 game turns in this game. In any given turn, playing pieces representing various townspeople will be moved across the gamemap, which is a map of Pleasantville.&#10;&#10;The Alien player will try to keep the whereabouts of the Alien-controlled townspeople a secret, while he or she &quot;takes over&quot; more unsuspecting townspeople and builds up strength for the final showdown with the Town player.  The Alien player, in short, will try to create a large army of townspeople-zombies, eliminate any opposition, and occupy Pleasantville as a base of operations.  The Town player will try to convince the townspeople that there is an alien menace in the town, and will attempt to fight any Alien-controlled townspeople encountered.  With luck and careful play, the Town player hopes to defeat the Alien-controlled&quot;zombies&quot;, locate the Alien Headquarters, and destroy the Alien Sub-Commander.&#10;&#10;The game mechanic involves use of two identical sets of carboard chits - one set having a star on the back indicating alien control. Each turn, the alien player may use misdirection and bluffing to fool the town player as to where the alien mind control is taking place. Real townspeople are &quot;swapped out&quot; with alien controlled ones and the town player must stop the spread of control sooner than later. A fun game for two players who enjoy bluffing and like simulating the action of classic movies like Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Invaders from Mars. Especially entertaining is the random Townsperson Movement table that simulates the day to day migration of unsuspecting townspeople as they go about their business in Pleasantville.&#10;&#10;";1981;6.08328;2.1111;2;2;45;12;Horror, Science Fiction

It may be played by up to 6 people, each playing the role of one of Stoker's characters. Many of the game elements are also derived from the book. In Stoker's novel, Dracula did indeed hide coffins in various secret locations so that he would always have a place to hide during the day, should his principle (sic?) lair be discovered. Dracula did have vampire brides and could command wolves, rats, bears and other supernatural beings. Effective against these un-dead creatures were The Host, holy water, crucifixes and silver bullets; not to mention the hammer and stake - tools required for dispatching vampires.&#10;&#10;The Vampyre basic game takes place on the map of Transylvania. The game is a race between the vampire hunters to see who will be the first to find and destroy three of Count Dracula's hidden coffins.&#10;&#10;The extended game is played on the reverse side of the map, Dracula's Castle, after the players have finished the basic game. Here, the players have already destroyed Dracula's hidden coffins.

You clobber enemy pawns by landing on them --they're sent back to their home space.&#10;&#10;The winner is the first player to place his pawns on their arrival spaces (by exact count).&#10;&#10;(The board consists of a three-lobed track; it touches the central star circle at its three innermost points.

You bargain for Big Deal cards when you land on a seller's space.  Only two offers and two counter-offers are allowed, to limit bargaining time.

Aesthetically interesting.&#10;&#10;First published by Edition Perlhuhn in 1980 (301 dice for 57 games), by Kosmos in 1986 (281 dice) and re-issued by Abacus in 2004 with 166 dice and fewer games. In 2011, Abacus revived it yet again, but with only 121 dice.&#10;&#10;The Kosmos edition shows age range &quot;4-99&quot; on its box, the latest edition shows &quot;6+&quot; instead.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    &quot;55&quot;, published in 2005 by Abacus&#10;&#10;&#10;";1980;6.14048;1.625;2;6;20;6;Abstract Strategy, Action / Dexterity, Dice, Game System
2230;Ayanu;"This game is 'Chess-like' in many ways: two players have identical sets of game pieces starting on opposite sides of a square grid. Players move one piece per turn and can eliminate the other player's pieces by moving into their space. Movement options depend on which piece it is you're moving. In a fit of conspicuous difference, it's the black side who makes the opening move here.&#10;&#10;The central gimmick is that each piece is composed of two parts, a body and a head. The height of the body determines how far a piece can move (one, two or three spaces), whereas the head determines the directions: straight lines (like rooks), diagonals (like bishops), or both (like kings or queens). Each side also has one super-powered queen/rook hybrid which can move to any space within the range determined by its body, and even one unbeatable but immobile head.&#10;&#10;There's a reason for all this separation into bodies and heads: after every move the piece which just moved must swap heads with a different type of head, chosen by the player from their pieces still in play.&#10;&#10;There are two victory conditions: either you move one of your pieces to a specific target square on the far side of the board, or you force your opponent to make an illegal move. Draws are possible, but rare (they require both sides' forces to be extremely depleted).&#10;&#10;The theme is pretty much irrelevant - this is an abstract at heart. The rulebook frames the game as the secret strategy-honing tool of the nobles in a fictional culture, and the rules introduction is presented in dialogue form with the Wise Old Master teaching the game to his Young Noble Student, but none of this is at all relevant to gameplay. In fact, the game presented within the fiction is themeless and, quite literally, abstract: the pieces' names are translated as abstract concepts like 'strength' etc.&#10;&#10;";1987;7.02453;2.2857;2;2;30;10;Abstract Strategy
2231;Watch;"Watch, a.k.a. Quick, is a game of tactics. The 25 wooden playing pieces in 10 different colors are placed on the 25 squares on the board. Each player has a playing token and in turn places their token over one of the wooden playing pieces on the board, but the second player can't choose the same color as the first. Following the rules of play, tokens are moved until one player either:&#10;&#10;&#10;    manages to move their token onto the piece occupied by their opponent, capturing it;&#10;    moves their token onto a piece of the same color as the piece on which their opponent's piece stands; or&#10;    ensures that their opponent is unable to move since all pieces in a vertical or horizontal line from the opposing token have already been removed.&#10;&#10;&#10;";1967;6.04;2.0;2;2;10;6;Abstract Strategy

2233;Colliding Circles;"Board is a series of circles, nineteen interlocked, each with six circular spaces. Each player has a hand of five dice which are placed on the circles.By forming number patterns with your circles you score points. What's particularly interesting is that you can move the dice-pieces and in so doing change the numbers. This is a highly original, uniquely interesting game, with a number of innovative mechanisms that flow nicely together. It's a territorial game, slightly reminiscent of GO, but with an engaging, even exciting random factor (each turn you throw one or two dice to replenish your hand).&#10;&#10;";1995;6.75;2.0;2;2;45;10;Abstract Strategy
2234;Chez Dork;"Inspired by the success of Chez Geek, Steve Jackson presents another John Kovalic inspiration. This game is about buying the latest geeky gadgets and gamer items. Each player takes on the personality of one of the stars of Kovalic's comic &quot;Dork Tower&quot; in an attempt to purchase and possess the items that satisfy their obsessions. Of course, tastes are prone to change (one week it's LARPs, the next it's Computer Games), so players are constantly trying to purchase/trade/auction items so as to reach a certain number of points (items in your obsession count double towards victory). A light-hearted game with loads of gamer/otaku/LARP humor makes this a nice filler game that anyone can play.&#10;&#10;NOTE: Some form of currency/money is needed to play this game.&#10;&#10;";2001;5.28876;1.3;2;6;30;12;Card Game

2236;Streets of Stalingrad;"&quot;Streets of Stalingrad&quot; is a World War 2 East Front wargame that models the fight for the city of Stalingrad, September-October, 1942, at the company level. It employs a scale of 300 meters per hex, with daily turns and 2160 counters.&#10;&#10;The two designers spent years researching the orders of battle and aerial maps to produce a game that is possibly the most researched and arguably the most accurate depiction of a battle, mechanics aside.&#10;&#10;The large, fairly thin but sturdy counters are the shades of the uniforms of the armies according to the designers. Instead of the usual American style designations on the counters to depict what type of unit it is, the designers used the actual designations used by the separate armies. This could be confusing except for the wonderful large player aids supplied with actual photos of the unit types. Labels and ziplock bag are even supplied for sorting purposes although sorting can be confusing. Moves mag put out an issue in the late '70's, early '80's with an article that fixed the problem.&#10;&#10;The 3 large maps are taken straight from aerial photos. You see the city block by block and outside the city individual buildings can even be seen. There is very little color on the maps but they are beautiful and very functional. The terrain effects chart once again has actual photos of the terrain so you can get an idea of exactly what the soldiers were facing.&#10;&#10;There are many scenarios available so you can tailor the game for time and room as some only use 1 map or a portion of a map. Each scenario has a separate set up sheet for both sides that are large enough to put all the counters on the sheets. Each scenario has a miniature version of the map to be used with set up information. For a monster game it is very easy to set up and get into a game.&#10;&#10;There are 3 rulebooks included, 2 basic game and 1 advanced game. When learning the game it is fantastic that they included a rulebook for each player. This is the kind of detail that is evident throughout the game. The rule books are detailed without being overbearing, as a lot of Avalon Hill's and SPI's were from the time period. They are chock full of examples to clear up ambiguities.&#10;&#10;The game is difficult because of the scale only. It is actually a fairly simple game, mechanics wise, and can be played by anyone with some wargame experience. This game shows that it has been designed to play, by wargamers, in every detail.&#10;&#10;";1979;7.61377;4.2727;2;2;180;12;Wargame, World War II

2247;Zero!: The Rise and Fall of The Imperial Japanese Air Force Dec 1941 - June 1942;"(from the GMT Website:)&#10;&#10;Volume III in the Down in Flames card game series moves to the Pacific Theatre of Operations in WWII. Players will recreate the first six months of furious aerial combat between the might of Imperial Japan and the surprised forces of the United Kingdom and the United States.&#10;&#10;Zero! includes the important early-war fighters and bomber of the Imperial Japanese Navy and Army, Royal Air Force, United States Navy, United States Army Air Force, and the American Volunteer Group (the famous Flying Tigers). Fly the fearsome A6M2 Zero against the F4F Wildcat, Hawker Hurricane IIb, Curtiss P-40B and E Tomahawks, and the ill-fated Brewster Buffalo. As a pilot with the Japanese Army, take Ki-27 Nates and Ki-43 Oscars to the skies against the Allies over Malaya and Burma. Match your skills with American aces Wagner, Thach, McCuskey or their semi-mercenary countrymen of the AVG, Hill and Newkirk. The Japanese can counter with Sakai, Anabuki, Kato, and more.&#10;&#10;As with the previous games in the series, Zero! includes the Campaigns covering the major aerial events of the December 1941 to June 1942 period. Each consists of multiple missions aimed at a variety of targets, for which you must wisely allocate your resources of men and material. New to Zero! are Carrier Campaigns, which give players some control over the carrier groups their naval squadrons fly from. Do you go all out for a decisive strike or hold your fighters back and let the enemy overextend himself? Campaigns included in this volume are: Pearl Harbor (solitaire), the Philippines, Malaya, Burma, Coral Sea, and Midway.&#10;&#10;Both Down in Flames veterans and newcomers to the series will enjoy this latest volume. All the components needed to play are included - ownership of the first two volumes is not necessary, but the three games are completely compatible. Beautiful, newly-designed, full-color action cards drive gameplay, while cards representing the major aircraft of the period and counters of the famous aces allow players to explore a wide range of scenarios. Besides the new Carrier Campaigns, historically significant missions have been added to the standard campaigns and the rules have been updated and expanded.&#10;&#10;Are you ready to relive history? Can you sweep the skies in the cockpit of the Zero, delaying or even stopping the appearance of American industrial might?

2248;Leverage;"Leverage is an exciting board game of strategy with a unique action feature; it includes various weighted pieces and is built around universal laws of balance and force. Leverage has been hailed as a favorite of GAMES MAGAZINE in 4 different years.&#10;&#10;Rules and game pieces are simple and easy to understand, yet tactics and strategy can be as sophisticated and challenging as the players themselves. Two opposing strategies (speed &amp; sacrifice vs. conservation &amp; mass force) provide intrigue and depth, as either may be merged into the other as the game unfolds.&#10;&#10;Constant action potential -- Jump, capture, sacrifice, block; and, the players may rock the board at any time to see how the leverage advantage is changing.&#10;&#10;Suspense -- The board always stabilizes at a level position until a move is made that tilts it down to rest at one end; there is no halfway tilt!  When the board tilts down, scoring pegs are removed until it returns to level.&#10;&#10;The winner is (1)the one who tilts the board down towards his opponent when the opponent has no scoring pegs left to remove, or (2)the one who moves all of his remaining playing pieces into the opposite Safety Zone while having more or an equal number of scoring pegs than his opponent.&#10;&#10;";1977;6.25;1.7895;2;2;30;10;Abstract Strategy

2250;Midway;"The basic idea is each player has his or her own map of the area (in this case the Midway Island) behind a screen. Each player &quot;searches&quot; for the enemy fleet by flying search planes to the various zones on the map and calling the zone co-ordinates. Once found, bombers can be sent in to sink the enemy fleet. The actual attack is fought on a separate battle board where the ships are first placed on a rectangular grid and the attacking planes are placed in adjacent rectangles or on top of the ships themselves to indicate which ship they are attacking.&#10;&#10;The basic game is very simple, but there are a number of additional rules which add realism and complexity: CAP fighters, surface actions, anvil and wave attacks, etc.&#10;&#10;The game is superior with a neutral referee for true double blind play.&#10;&#10;Developed with the technical aid of C.

2251;Strat-O-Matic Baseball;"An iconic major league baseball game that is so well known that it is exhibited in the National Baseball Hall of Fame. The game is conducted with pitcher and batter cards constructed with statistical probabilities so they realistically reproduce the real-life performance of each player for the season represented.  The gamer is placed in the role of the manager and/or general manager of a team and controls the batting order, the choice of a starting pitcher, game strategies (hit and run, steals, intentional walks, bunting, positioning of infielders, pinch hitters, defensive substitutions, pitching changes, etc.).  If a full season is played, the game produces amazingly realistic statistics at the player, team, and league levels.  The game comes in two versions: a cards and dice version that has been around since 1962 and a computer version that automatically looks up play outcomes and compiles player, team and league statistics.  Every year, Strat-O-Matic releases new player card sets based on the previous baseball season, seasons past, and some &quot;greats&quot; collections.&#10;&#10;";1962;7.84872;2.3853;1;2;45;11;Sports

2253;Touring;"Touring is a card game with the theme of an automobile trip. Players are competing to be the first one to complete a prescribed set of mileage cards. In all versions of the game you need 16 mileage cards to win. From lowest to highest value cards, the required counts are 8, 4, 2 and 2. Other players will try to slow you down by playing cards against you which cause you to lose mileage cards, or to play &quot;problem&quot; cards which you must remove by playing a corresponding &quot;remedy&quot; card.&#10;&#10;The game can be played in partnership for the 4- and 6-player versions, with each partnership playing as a single driver.&#10;&#10;Touring was originally published in 1906 by the Touring Card Company, then sold by Wallie Dorr, and then later picked up by Parker Brothers in 1924. Winning Moves Games currently (2015) holds the trademark for and publishes Touring.  If the mechanics sound familiar, it is the inspiration for the game Mille Bornes, which has since become more popular.&#10;&#10;As driving technology improved, card names and depicted mileage values became outdated and were thus replaced with longer distances.  There are multiple sets of rules, which reflect these changes.  A recent edition added some card categories.&#10;&#10;The action card types are different between Touring and Mille Bornes. For example, Mille Bornes adds the &quot;protective&quot; cards, e.g. Emergency Vehicle which allows you to ignore speed limits. Thus in Mille Bornes a player has more decisions to make.&#10;&#10;See also:&#10;&#10;     The Lindy Flying Game - A 1927 Nucraft Toys version of Touring based on Charles Lindbergh's flight across the Atlantic.  &#10;     Lindy, the New Flying Game - 1927 Parker Brothers sequel where Touring card play has been themed on Charles Lindbergh's flight across the Atlantic.&#10;     Mille Bornes - A similar game to Touring, first published in 1954.&#10;     Wings: The Air Mail Game - Another &quot;flying&quot; game like Lindy, but card deck split into two parts with different colors.&#10;     Stap op - The Dutch adaptation (bikes!) of the classic game Touring, from 1950 and still published today.&#10;&#10;&#10;Stap op is the Dutch adaptation (bikes!) of the classic American game Touring (cars!).&#10;&#10;";1906;5.24024;1.2105;2;6;30;8;Card Game, Racing, Sports

2255;Kartenschach;"Kartenschach is proposed as 16 Chess games in 1. They are all variations on Chess using cards to augment the game. All are for 2 players. Many of the games are pure strategy with no randomness, just like Chess itself; many of them have an element of luck; and many of them introduce other game elements into Chess, including bluffing, hand management, resource management, gambling, push-your-luck, trick-taking, auctions, etc. There is something here for everyone--including the serious Chess player.&#10;&#10;In every game, a player's possible moves are determined, to varying extents, by the cards available to that player. Sometimes, a king will appear to be threatened, but will actually be safe, if the attacking piece is unable to move. As such, check and checkmate have been removed from these games entirely; a player may willingly enter or stay &quot;in check.&quot; The goal of every game is simply to capture the opposing king.&#10;&#10;";2000;6.78462;2.0;2;2;60;12;Abstract Strategy, Card Game

One of the early Avalon Hill beginner war games.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;Ever since men began making weapons they have used them to create legends: in early 1941, when his conquest of Europe was embarrassed by the rout of his Italian allies in Africa, Hitler dispatched General Erwin Rommel to forestall a seemingly inevitable Axis defeat. Reorganizing the forces under his command as the Deutsches Afrika Korps (DAK), Rommel immediately launched the first of his legendary desert offensives.&#10;&#10;Now, the legend of &quot;The Desert Fox&quot; is recreated. From April 1941 through the climatic battle at El Alamein in later 1942. Afrika Korps simulates the mobile conflict between Rommel's Panzerarmee Afrika and the British Eighth Army defending Egypt and the Suez Canal.

2266;Gobblet;"Gobblet is an abstract game played on a 4x4 grid with each of the two players having twelve pieces that can nest on top of one another to create three stacks of four pieces.&#10;&#10;Your goal in Gobblet is to place four of your pieces in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row. Your pieces start nested off the board. On a turn, you either play one exposed piece from your three off-the-board piles or move one piece on the board to any other spot on the board where it fits. A larger piece can cover any smaller piece. A piece being played from off the board may not cover an opponent's piece unless it's in a location where your opponent threatens to win with 3 pieces in a row.&#10;&#10;Your memory is tested as you try to remember whose piece one of your larger pieces is covering before you move it. As soon as a player has four pieces in a row, s/he wins &mdash; except in one case: If you lift your piece and reveal an opponent's piece that completes a four-in-a-row, you don't immediately lose; you can't return the piece to its starting location, but if you can place it over one of the opponent's three other pieces in that line, the game continues.&#10;&#10;_______________&#10;Similiar to : &#10;&#10;     Cover Up&#10;&#10;&#10;";2000;6.61802;1.8361;2;2;20;7;Abstract Strategy, Memory

2271;Creeper;"Selection #4 of The Games Collection by Pin International.&#10;&#10;Creeper is an abstract strategy game which belongs in the same family as Hex/Twixt. That is, two players attempt to link two sides of the board with a chain of pieces.&#10;&#10;Players: 2 only. One plays black, the other white.&#10;The Bits:&#10;&#10;     16 pawns, 8 black and 8 white.&#10;     32 &quot;Othello&quot; disks, i.e. black one side and white on the other.&#10;     A board made up of a 6&times;6 square grid of octagons. &#10;&#10;&#10;The game: Although the spaces on the board are octagonal, the main playing pieces ( the pawns ) are placed and played in the squares that are formed where the corners of the octagons meet.&#10;On his/her turn, the player may move one of their 8 pawns.&#10;A move may consist of leaping diagonally over an octagon, or a simple move between one octagon and the next in a straight line, or finally a pawn may capture an opponents` pawn by jumping over it a la checkers/draughts.&#10;&#10;In the first case, if a pawn makes the diagonal jump one of two actions may take place: if the octagon is empty, one of the disks is played inside it, with the players` colour uppermost. Alternatively, if the octagon is occupied by an opponents` disk, this disk is flipped over to show the opposite side (and therefore colour). &#10;The winner is the first player to link two specific diagonally opposed corners ( black must link top left to bottom right and white top right to bottom left), with a continuous chain of their colour disks. Only orthogonal links count, not diagonal.&#10;&#10;&#10;";1995;6.53281;1.875;2;2;20;10;Abstract Strategy

2273;Hopfen & Malz;"This db spiele game can be translated to &quot;Hops and Malt&quot; in English.  The goal of the game is to brew the best beer using ingredients associated with the German purity law:  Malt, hops, and water.  There is a card deck associated with each of these 3 ingredients:  a malt deck, a hops deck and a water deck.  Players have a limited amount of money to purchase ingredients for their beer.  Ingredients in each deck are valued from 1 (worst ingredients) to 6 (best ingredients).  The decks are shuffled separately and the 3 decks are placed face down in the table.  The top card of each deck is turned over.  In turn, each player may buy any of the 3 ingredients with their money.  This continues until all the ingredients are gone or the players run out of money.  Now, players sell their beer at market.  To make beer, you must have 1 hop card + 1 malt card + 1 water card.  The value of the beer is the sum of the value of the cards.  Contracts valued between 10 and 100 are turned over 1 at a time.  Players use once around bidding with their beer to buy the best contracts.  The total value of the contracts purchased determines the winning player.&#10;&#10;";1992;5.5;0.0;3;6;30;8;Card Game, Economic

2277;Lose Your Shirt;"Fortunes change at a stroke in this exciting game of betting and bluffing! Play your cards right and you'll be on a winning streak --but give too much away and you'll find your opponent's horse piping you at the post. Tension's high from the instant the horses leave their starting stalls. You keep the horse you've backed secret until you judge the moment's right to reveal it --cunning players will push other horses forward to create a &quot;false scent&quot;, then try to come through the field with a last minute burst and take the race at the winning post. If you back for a place, you play safe...But the stakes will be low. If you try for a big win...You could lose your shirt! This exciting race game keeps everyone guessing --and trying-- till the very last moment, and whether you win or lose it will provide hours of fascinating family fun.&#10;&#10;Contents: Felt playing area, 42 horse movement cards, 12 betting indicator cards, money, six plastic horses in different colors, starting stalls and grandstand. In the Canadian edition, the felt became a standard board, and the starting stalls and grandstand are gone as they were just chrome (theme elements not employed in the game).&#10;&#10;For each of the eight races the cards are thoroughly shuffled and dealt out to each player. The different cards (5 per horse) advance each horse at various rates (2 to 4 spaces) in the race and there are also 12 cards that affect any horse in the race (backwards 2 or forward 3). Players secretly bet on a horse to either win or place (take first or second place); you can also bet the jackpot (which is made up of all losing bets from previous races), which is like betting for a win except the minimum stake is higher and the payout is handled differently. Betting on a horse actually means taking one of its movement cards out...until you decide to play it, revealing your bet --one of this game's numerous subtleties.&#10;&#10;During the race, the players play their horse cards in turn, maneuvering the horses as needed --horses have very limited sidestepping and could be blocked during the race. If a player &quot;loses his shirt&quot; i.e. goes broke, he just continues the game playing cards but not betting.&#10;&#10;It can be best described as a cross between Win, Place &amp; Show and Undercover (a.k.a.

2281;Pictionary;"Playing Pictionary may remind you of Charades, but with drawing on paper instead of acting out the answers.  In Pictionary, though, both teams' (or even all three teams') clue givers may be drawing at the same time as players strive to be the first to guess the correct answer.  When the answer is not designated &quot;All Play,&quot; one team simply tries to come up with the answer before the timer runs out, which is usually but not always possible thanks to the varying difficulty levels of the answers.  No great drawing talent is required; instead, players gain an edge if they have a good imagination when guessing, empathy for their team mates, and/or a general ability to communicate in restricted circumstances.  A board is provided, just to keep score on, which focuses the competition.  Pictionary was a big hit when it first appeared and has been a classic on the party game scene ever since.&#10;&#10;";1985;5.84313;1.2254;3;16;90;12;Party Game

You move from the Roman camp (which gets you 3 cards) to the village and back until the deck is exhausted.

A small Roman cohort can be hit to garner an extra card.&#10;&#10;When two players end up in the same space, there can be a tussle, with one card --picked randomly-- being swapped. The real strategy comes in deciding which of the two dice to use: the slow one (1-4) or the fast one (3-6). When using the fast one, any player can cry out &quot;Exchange!&quot; and swap his hand for yours...&#10;&#10;The 48 Roman cards are worth from 1 to 5 helmets each, but there are a fair number of red cards bearing non-helmets (caligae, shields, pilums, etc) which score from -1 to -5.

As the Allied player, take up your binoculars and assemble your powerful, yet fragile, allied army of Americans, British, and French to decisively defeat the &quot;Desert Fox.&quot; You command the tanks, artillery, infantry, and aircraft that decided this fateful battle.&#10;&#10;The system is an amalgamation of Vance von Borries&#039;s Invasion: Sicily (including the extremely importantly efficiency ratings) and East Front System (Typhoon; Barbarossa Trilogy), with some accommodation for the smaller scale; the game should be quite familiar to veterans of these games. The game features the best existing detailed Order of Battle developed from extensive research by an international team. Game units include commandos, engineers, HQs, motorcycle troops, a wide variety of tanks including Tiger tanks, the dreaded German 88mm flak guns, and a variety of aircraft. Experienced players will find most game mechanics to be familiar and the newcomer will find help from the many examples of play. Featured items include ranged artillery and artillery fire nets, combat coordination, defender reaction and counter-attack, and minefields. All units are also rated for efficiency.&#10;&#10;Scenarios:&#10;&#10;    Faid Pass - 30 January to 1 February, 6 turns, centered on the Faid Pass quadrant.

2299;Lords of the Renaissance;"Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Lords of the Renaissance is a game for 2-12 players set at the end of the Dark Ages. Each player starts as a Merchant Prince of a European Duchy, operating a bank or merchant company speculating in the silk trade. Players also act as a military or financial adviser to one of the great empires, advising their suzerains in matters of conquest, shipbuilding, and the construction of cathedrals and libraries. Through the establishment of trade routes and the paying of tributes, players grow rich, as they are emboldened to fight to protect their monopolies or expand their influence. Plenty of Machiavellian intrigue as players shift allegiances and conspire to become emperors themselves.&#10;&#10;";1996;6.13098;3.3333;2;12;300;12;Economic, Political, Renaissance, Transportation, Wargame
2300;Invasion Sicily;"A cousin of Vance von Borries&#039;s East Front System, Invasion Sicily covers the Operation Husky, 1943. The major difference from the Barbarossa games is the addition of an &quot;efficiency rating&quot; to all units, which affects combat in a variety of ways to make it less predictable and less subject to factor-counting (similar to OCS's action ratings).&#10;&#10;The Allies are given a variety of invasion options, from the historical Husky through invasions in eastern and western Sicily and (most aggressively) Calabria - the toe if Italy itself. The timing and units assigned to the invasions is almost entirely flexible.&#10;&#10;";1998;7.04167;2.5833;2;2;360;12;Wargame, World War II

The cards are worth various points depending on their rarity.&#10;The are also very rare birds that become available on occasion to whoever gets to them first.&#10;The game is intended more as a fun way to learn about birds rather than a strategy game.&#10;&#10;";1988;7.0;0.0;2;6;240;0;Animals, Educational

2304;Knock Out;"Each player is a boxing manager with a stable of two boxers, one a light weight contender and the other a heavy weight.  Each turn you take one of your rested fighters and challenge one of your opponents fighters.  You begin the game with 12 fight cards ranging from 1 to 5. For each bout you choose four of which you will use up to 3 for the 3 round event.  A knock out will of course end the fight early.  Each round players select 1 card and reveal it simultaneously.  The higher card wins the round, ties go to the defender and ones beat fives.  And how could you have boxing without betting.  Everyone gets in on this including the managers involved in the current contest.  Challenges go on until there are no longer enough cards to stage a fight.  Whoever has won the most money through fights and bets is the winner.&#10;&#10;";1994;5.9101;2.1667;3;5;60;12;Bluffing, Fighting, Sports
2306;Bewitched;"The players have three frogs each and need to retrieve the witch's spell book in order to be turned back into princes.&#10;There are four spell books, one real and three fakes, hidden under witches' hats.  Frogs try to find the real spell book and return with it to their lily pads - the first to do so is the winner.&#10;To make matters more difficult, books can be stolen from other frogs and there are snakes and cats. The snakes lie on the tracks and must be hopped over.  Some bite - they have a magnet that is attracted to some (not all) of the frogs - others just lie still.  Flowers are collected as an antidote to snake bites.&#10;Players can move a cat each turn instead of a frog. No frog would dare walk past a cat, so they are placed in the way of frogs to hold them up and allow or prevent the theft of a book.&#10;&#10;";1988;5.07368;1.0;2;4;45;8;Children's Game, Fantasy
2308;Atlantis: Pathways of the Deep;"Based on the Disney movie, each player must move his sub from a corner of a 9x9 frame to the center. Each player has a hand of 4 tiles and plays 2 each turn. Tiles show either pathways that can be played on to the game frame or they show special actions such as removing tiles and moving extra spaces. In lieu of playing tiles, players may rotate a tile already on the board instead. A player can then move his own sub 2 spaces on available paths or move an opponent's sub one space.&#10;&#10;";2001;4.4721;1.0;2;4;20;7;Children's Game, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Nautical, Puzzle

On each turn, a player may draw a key card (keys come in four colors) or play one or more combinations of four appropriately colored key cards to open some of the 35 available safes (only seven safes and their contents are revealed and available each round) to collect cash. Players receive a bonus for opening the seventh and final safe each round, and also for cracking two or more safes in a single turn.

2311;Wild Life;"Not to be confused with Ravensburger's famous Wildlife Adventure game, although there are some similarities. Both come in the same (very) large-box format, and in Wild Life, much as in Wildlife Adventure, players travel about a large world map seeking to visit the habitats of rare and exotic animals.&#10;&#10;With a box description reading &quot;An ecology game that fosters wild animal conservation&quot; and &quot;The game of world-wide travel to search for, trade, and collect wild and rare animals to fill a winning zoo,&quot; Wild Life is primary a roll-and-move game where players circle a set map with various stops, at which they might collect Harbor, Transport, or &quot;Serata&quot; cards (which may help or hinder your progress similar to the cards in Monopoly) or collect, trade, and sell various animal cards in an attempt to collect the specific sets needed to fill the specific &quot;zoo&quot; each player chose at the beginning of the game. The first player to collect all the cards needed to fill their chosen zoo wins the game.&#10;&#10;Interestingly, although the game says it can support up to five players, if there is a fifth player that person actually only acts as the game's banker and does not actually participate in the game otherwise.&#10;&#10;The game is asymmetrical; each zoo has its own strengths and weaknesses and favour different strategies.&#10;&#10;Note that there are several different versions of the game with varying mechanics, some of which have much more strategy than others; see the community wiki for details.&#10;&#10;";1964;5.45217;1.4583;2;5;90;10;Adventure, Animals, Educational, Environmental, Exploration

Played on a randomly assembled board composed of 12 octagonal and 11 square pieces, with one corner representing the hobbits' home and the other Mt. Doom. Players race to complete several lesser quests before being allowed to cast the One Ring into the fires of Mt. Doom, all while avoiding ringwraith, orc and Gollum tokens or moving Gandalf to help. Unlike the newer, much-heralded The Lord of the Rings game, this is not a cooperative quest, although all players do lose if a ringbearer is caught by a ringwraith.&#10;&#10;";1992;5.00581;2.0714;2;4;120;10;Fantasy, Novel-based

The American victory led to French support and a turning of the tide of the war in the North. One side is the British, the other side, the Americans. Movement is from linked town to town along a road or river, rather than hex movement. In this light, asymmetrical wargame there are rules for entrenching, fortifications, and supply, as well as optional rules with combat odds and percentage losses.

2316;X-Bugs;"The History:&#10;In the famous Roswell crash, the alien crew died, but some alien insects survived... and at the moment they're ready to conquer the world!&#10;But during the cold war, US and Soviet scientists studied a solution: genetically modified earth insects, strong enough to deal with the menace!&#10;The battle is going to begin!&#10;&#10;The Game:&#10;the game is based on the classic tiddlywinks: every army has three &quot;bases&quot; which have to be defended, and various &quot;soldier insects&quot; (winks) with various shapes, dimensions, and special abilities.&#10;An &quot;insect&quot; is captured when an opponent &quot;insect&quot; stop over it. A &quot;base&quot; is captured the second time an opponent &quot;insect&quot; stop over it.&#10;Three 6-sided creature dice for every army are rolled every turn, and dictates which kinds of insects can move. When you lose a base, you lose a die and therefore some mobility. When you lose the second base, you're out of the game.&#10;&#10;There are six armies, but only four were published in the United States. The game is sold in boxes containing two armies, and each army is separately available in two colors so identical forces can face each other:&#10;- USArthropods Vs. Flyborgs&#10;- Sovietoptera Vs.

2317;Mückenstich;"M&uuml;ckenstich is a trick-taking card game with four suits, with each suit having cards numbered 1-12 (with two 12s) and three mosquitoes; a mosquito has no number but is the highest card in a suit.&#10;&#10;Each round, players start with a number of cards in hand, then discard two of those cards face down. For the most part, M&uuml;ckenstich follows traditional trick-taking rules. The active player lays down a card, then each other player follows by playing a single card, following suit, if possible. Whenever a mosquito is played, that player declares one color to be trump. (The game starts with no trump color.) A mosquito or 12 played later in the round is considered higher than one played earlier. Once all players have laid down a card, the highest trump card (if any) wins the trick; with no trump, the highest card in the suit led for the round wins the trick. Players keep track of tricks won, and the winner of a trick leads to the next trick.&#10;&#10;Once all tricks have been played, the single player with the fewest tricks names one suit to count double during scoring, then the single player with the most mosquitoes names one of the three remaining suits to be worthless. Then players tally their points: The first mosquito in a suit is worth -5 points, while all other mosquitos are worth 0. Suited cards are worth 0-2 depending on whether they are worthless, scored as normal, or doubled.&#10;&#10;After a number of rounds equal to the number of players (or twice as many rounds with three players), the player with the highest total score wins.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.71575;1.8;3;6;30;9;Card Game

Players have defense and attack missiles and secretly write down their moves (three per round) before performing them in a particular order (which may render some the moves impossible due to the actions of others).&#10;&#10;";1974;6.72381;2.1429;2;4;60;10;Bluffing, Wargame
2342;Mystery Mansion;"Mystery Mansion is a unique search game that challenges you to build a Victorian Mansion, room by room, as you search these rooms for hidden treasure.  Build the mansion by adding new rooms onto existing rooms with the roll of a special die.  Every room contains many objects which are all possible hiding places for clues to the whereabouts of the Real Treasure.  Search cards allow you to look behind, under and inside these objects for clues.  Try to add rooms that you suspect contain objects that match Search cards in your hand.  If you have a Search card that matches an object in the same room as your pawn, play it and draw a Clue card.  The clue might be a Treasure Chest, a Key to a chest, a Secret Passage or just Cobwebs and Dust.  If you own a key that matches a chest, haul the chest out of the mansion to unlock it.  Once it's outside, the big moment comes as you open the lid.  Will it be filled with gold and jewels or cobwebs and dust?&#10;&#10;";1984;6.14958;1.8261;3;4;90;8;Children's Game, Deduction, Exploration, Murder / Mystery
2343;Electronic Talking Mystery Mansion;"While this may have intended to be just an electronic update of the earlier Milton Bradley game, Electronic Talking Mystery Mansion ends up being a very different game.  Instead of a modular board, the board is fixed but the content of the rooms is variable.  Gone is the need to collect the right Search cards.  Instead players can search any item they like.  The electronic organizer tells the players what clues they find.  Some information is given to everyone, other information is just given to the active player.  Players deduce the location of the money based on the clues they find, and have to collect the correct clue cards (one item, one person) out of the 12 possible in order to obtain the money and win the game.  &#10;   The changes from the earlier board game: no search cards, no chests to drag out of the house, fewer hiding spots, and fewer clue cards, makes this version play much quicker and feel quite a bit lighter.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.43554;1.4;2;4;45;8;Deduction, Electronic, Exploration, Murder / Mystery

The new cards allow the game to go to 6 players instead of the 4 proposed by the base game.&#10;&#10;The expansion adds no new card types, but doubling the number of available cards makes the game much easier to play.  In the original game, especially with 4 players, the late game could sometimes stall as there weren't enough resources for the players to drive to a win.

2346;DVONN;"DVONN is played on an elongated hexagonal board, with 23 white, 23 black and 3 red DVONN-pieces. In the beginning the board is empty. The players place the pieces on empty spaces of the board, without restrictions. They place the DVONN-pieces first and their own pieces next. Then they start stacking pieces on top of each other. A single piece may be moved 1 space in any direction, a stack of two pieces may be moved two spaces, etc. A stack must always be moved as a whole and a move must always end on top of another piece or stack. If pieces or stacks lose contact with the DVONN-pieces, they must be removed from the board. The game ends when no more moves can be made. The players put the stacks they control on top of each other and the one with the highest stack is the winner.&#10;&#10;This game is part of project GIPF.&#10;&#10;";2001;7.44144;2.6532;2;2;30;9;Abstract Strategy

Pieces move a number of spaces equal to the number of other pieces they are stacked on. Only the piece on the top of a stack may move. There are two entrances onto the game track, but only one route leading  to the finish area. The track contains a &quot;trampoline&quot; space which allows a player to double the  distance of a move when landing on this spot.

There are 4 different types of items in this version, which are the different kinds of street performers in the marketplaces of Muscat.  The tiles representing the performers are placed in these marketplaces in such a way as to establish local dominance hierarchies, which are resolved by kicking the loser out on the street and promoting the winners to higher-class sections of Muscat.  Eventually, once can reach the Sultan's palace, and when enough performers have everyone scores points according to how high their performers have advanced up the board.&#10;&#10;There is more to it than that, of course.  The performers kicked out on the street want to get their revenge, and they can be placed back on the board or used to take 3 special actions which add a great deal of complexity to the game.  Although there is some randomness (in which tiles you pick when), this is essentially an abstract of the &quot;brain-burner&quot; school, and should be enjoyed by those who like that kind of  game.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Message to the Czar&#10;&#10;&#10;";2001;6.54106;2.381;3;5;45;10;Abstract Strategy, Arabian

2355;Last Frontier: The Artifact;"Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;THE ARTIFACT is a space opera using the Last Frontier: The Vesuvius Incident game system (published  by Fat Messiah Games). Three to eight players take over such roles as the Mad Scientist, the Space Pirate Captain, the Phone Company, or a mystery Alien. Because the format is four way blind, and the players are uncertain of each other's motives, the fog of war is a formidable obstacle in this new gaming genre.&#10;&#10;The action takes place on a space warehouse at the edge of an un-navigable region of the Galaxy known as the Coal Sack. The mad scientist in charge of the facility is trying to sell the Artifact, an alien navigational buoy, to  space pirates. The scientist wins if he completes the deal while keeping his illegal activities secret from the Phone Company, who has a couple of agents on board the station somewhere.&#10;&#10;Victory for the Phone Company depends upon who their secret employers are. His agents may be just innocent employees here to fix the phone lines, they may be working for a rival Museum, or they may work for the Government or private agencies.&#10;&#10;The Pirate Captain's motives are more transparent; he needs to get the Artifact by trade, artifice, or force. Even with his overwhelming firepower, this is not easy. One of his men may be a government informant. The Artifact may not be all it seems. Loss of contact with his men may mean they have turned against him, or alien bugs have laid eggs on their disemboweled remains. A clank outside may signal imminent explosive decompression, or just a sailmaker robot on the outside hull doing its job.&#10;&#10;Aliens may or may not be on board; their nature is unknown. The ship's computer may or may not be a sentient character working with its own victory conditions. One's partner may be a trusted companion or a shapeshifting fiend in disguise. The ship's security system, robots, and self-destruct countdown may be puppets for unknown agencies.&#10;&#10;The Artifact is a gripping drama, full of surprises and mayhem. No two games are alike, full of sabotage, sneak suits, bluster, kamikaze aliens, EMP and plasma guns, booby traps, hacking, and the prospect of the space station being blown up bit by bit by pirate cannon. The action never falters until the last lifeboat is away, the final alias revealed, and the last storeroom explored.&#10;&#10;";2001;7.11515;3.6;3;8;120;10;Adventure, Deduction, Expansion for Base-game, Negotiation, Science Fiction, Wargame
2356;Scrabble Sentence Cube Game;"Players in turn roll the 21 word cubes, set the timer and form sentences with the words appearing on the tops of the cubes in a crossword puzzle-like fashion (one word may be part of two sentences - one running vertically and one running horizontally). Turns end when the egg timer runs out. Players score 50 points for each sentence of 7 words or more. All other sentences score the square of the number of words in the sentence (i.e. a 4-word sentence scores 4 X 4, or 16 points). A bonus of 50 points is awarded if all 21 cubes are used. Two points are deducted for each unused cube.&#10;&#10;The 1983 version of the game seems to differ in the number of cubes.  The rules on the inside of the box lid still have a 1971 copyright date, but among other differences, they state that the game contains 27 cubes.  Two of the new cubes are marked with stars on all six sides, making them wild.

Hurrying a little and elbowing your way through the bar is okay, but if you aren't careful and overshoot the mark you're back on the street again.&#10;&#10;Goal&#10;Collecting as many points as possible by winning the most valuable drink cards.&#10;&#10;Game play&#10;The board shows Lola's Bar with a couple of tables, a parcours consisting of several spaces, and the counter. At the counter, you can get sparkling wine (&quot;Sekt&quot;) or soda (&quot;Selters&quot;). To reach the counter, you roll the dice.&#10;On each turn, you roll up to three times and move one of your four pawns the corresponding number of spaces. Pawns have a value of 1-4. For the first roll, you use one die, for the second roll two dice, and for the third roll three dice, and you have to use the same pawn in each of your up to three rolls per turn. In between rolls, you can decide to stop and end your turn. If one of your pawns reaches one of the four counter spaces, you get the top sparkling wine card (sparkling wine cards are stacked face up). &#10;Sparkling wine cards mostly have positive values, some of them show a dot before one or several zeros (.0, .00, .000). The dot means that you use your pawn that reached the counter to determine its value, i.e. if your pawn with value 4 gets the .000 card, it is worth 400 points. The pawn is put on the card and stays there for the rest of the game.&#10;If you roll too high and your pawn passes the counter space, you get served soda, i.e. you draw the top of the face-down soda cards. Soda cards mostly have negative values (-10 to -1000), and there is also a card which bans you from the bar (i.e. your token is removed from the game).&#10;If you land on a special space, you have to use this particular pawn.&#10;There can only be one pawn per space. If you'd land on a space that is already occupied, the other player decides which closest free space (either backwards or forwards) you have to move your pawn to.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player has no pawns left. The player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;";1992;5.83846;1.0;2;4;30;8;Dice

2364;Black Monday;"Black Monday gets its name from the stock market crash of Oct. 19, 1987, and it's a commercial edition of Sid Sackson's game &quot;Card Stock Market&quot; from the book Card Games Around the World, with this game being playable with two standard decks of playing cards.&#10;&#10;The game includes 104 cards, with corporation cards in four colors. Each card shows a monetary value, along with a number of shares. Reveal cards from the deck until you get one card of each color, and use these cards to set the starting price of the shares for each of the four corporations. Deal each player a hand of eight cards, and give each player $20,000 as starting capital.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you can deal in shares (both buying and selling) and change the value of stocks, but you must do all of your dealing either prior to or subsequent to changing stock values. When you deal, you can sell any number of shares you own, earning money from the bank equal to the number of shares sold by the current value of those shares; when you buy, you can lay down at most two cards from your hand, paying money to the bank equal to the number of shares bought by the current value of those shares.&#10;&#10;When you change value, you take one or two cards from your hand and cover a corporation's current value with this new value; corporations have different limits on how much they can be raised or lowered per card play, with some being more stable than others. If you play the highest-valued cards, you can either pump up the value tremendously &mdash; or tank the stock, bringing its value to $0, with all players discarding all shares they own of this stock. (A player can jumpstart the value of this company by playing a new stock value on it, even with the second card played on the same turn.)&#10;&#10;Alternatively, you can skip the dealing and changing actions to discard 1-4 cards from hand. In either case, to end your turn, replenish your hand to eight cards.&#10;&#10;When the deck is exhausted, take all of the discards and all of the stock value cards other than the top one of each corporation and shuffle them together with a &quot;Market Closed&quot; card to form a new deck. Continue play until the &quot;Market Closed&quot; card is drawn, at which point the game ends immediately, and all shares held by players are cashed out at the current stock value.

2382;Sea-Fleet;"Players move their playing pieces on an 11 by 11 grid gameboard. Several of the grid squares are specially marked and under certain circumstances allow a player to take and extra (bonus) move of the piece being moved.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with 3 Battleships, 5 Destroyers, and 3 Submarines. Each type of pieces move in unique (different) ways.&#10;&#10;Game Plays 2 Ways:&#10;1) Low-Skill -  Uses luck of rolled die to determines the number of&#10;                squares a player may move any one of his/her pieces.&#10;2) High-Skill - No luck (of die), all skill. In this case, the number of&#10;                square moves allotted to the playing pieces is fixed, as   &#10;                determined by the game rules.&#10;&#10;The object of game is to be the first player to eliminate any 8 of your opponent's 11 playing pieces. You eliminate your opponent's pieces by moving one of your pieces to or through a square occupied by your opponent's piece.&#10;&#10;Latest Game Review:&#10;(Nov. 2006) By Ron McClung of &quot;The Gaming Report&quot;.

2384;Safe Return Doubtful;"A game simulating Arctic exploration and the race for the North Pole in the years 1845-1910. Players choose an explorer, ship, and crew, and outfit their expedition. Terrain cards take the place of a map, so each expedition encounters variable terrain on their journey north. Once the ice is reached, they proceed on foot or by sled as far as they dare, limited by bad food, weather, crevasses, scurvy, deep snow, and mutiny. Due to the &quot;you against the elements&quot; nature of the expeditions, player interaction is minimized, making for an excellent solitaire game. Three solitaire scenarios are included, as well as the 2 to 5 player competition game that includes disaster card play and newspaper attacks on your opponents. Rulesbook, 195 cards, player aid charts, and expedition log sheets are included. Will you reach the pole and return ahead of Peary, or end up icebound and abandoned like Franklin?&#10;&#10;It's also possible to lose your ship and be forced to try riding home on an iceberg!&#10;&#10;";1996;6.12869;2.0;1;5;60;0;Adventure, Card Game, Exploration, Racing

2388;Dark Nebula;"Dark Nebula has 8 small map-boards representing sectors of about six or so Star systems. The boards are placed randomly at the start of the game by both players one at a time, to their own advantage. The game is played in turns with each player's turn having a number of phases. Get the money you earn from your star systems, move your ships and combat, a reaction from your opponent (which has some restrictions), a final move and combat by you, then it is the other players turn.&#10;&#10;The object of the game varies with the board placement, but basically you need to control your opponents Home-World for a number of turns..&#10;&#10;One of GDW&#039;s Series 120 games, a line of introductory wargames spanning various historical eras.  The games in the series had 120 counters and were supposed to be playable in 120 minutes or less, hence the name.&#10;&#10;The game plays quite fast because the rules, while badly referenced (typical of GDW), are quite straight forward (medium simple). You need to get some card and mount the boards, but the boards themselves are nice enough. The counters are standard fare, but have no printing on the back to show disrupted units.&#10;&#10;The system is based on that used in Imperium: Empires in Conflict &#226;&#128;&#147; Worlds in the Balance.&#10;&#10;";1980;6.42944;2.3;2;2;180;12;Economic, Exploration, Science Fiction, Space Exploration, Wargame

2396;Ur: 1830 BC;"This game isn't a true 18xx game, in the sense that it's officially sanctioned by Francis Tresham.  However, it shares a good number of characteristics with the 18xx series of games, while still being different enough to be a different game.  The game is about diverting water from rivers into irrigation channels and supplying the life-giving water to sections of land.  In 18xx, there are private companies; in Ur, there are independent nations.  In 18xx, there are companies with shareholders and a majority-controlling president; in Ur, there are countries with landowners and a majority-controlling King.  Once a Kingdom has enough land purchased in it, it begins to build water infrastructure in the form of reservoirs and pumps.  These structures draw the water away from the rivers into irrigation channels which are drawn straight on the board.  Like 18xx, the technology increases as the game progresses, making channel diggers obsolete and bringing out more efficient waterworks.  When a section of land is irrigated, the owner earns a small degree income and the kingdom it's located in earns a much larger income, which can then be given to the landowners or kept in the Kingdom's coffers for future upgrades.  The game is finally over when all the incoming water is used, forcing the southern tribes to invade, or a kingdom cannot fulfill it's obligation to buy more ditch-diggers and falls into revolution.  The player with the largest personal holdings (land and money) is the victor.&#10;&#10;";2001;6.84428;3.8621;3;6;180;14;Ancient, Civilization
2398;Cribbage;"Cribbage is a card game invented in the early 17th century, based on the earlier game Noddy. It is played with a deck of standard playing cards and a signature piece of equipment called the cribbage board.  Cribbage is traditionally played as a 2 player game.&#10;&#10;In the version usually played today, each player is dealt a hand of 6 cards, from which they discard 2 into a special pile called the Crib.  One card is then cut from the draw pile and turned face up - it is considered part of each player's hand and of the Crib.  The players then play cards in turn, scoring points for hitting certain totals, or for making sets or sequences.  Score is kept by moving pegs along tracks on the cribbage board.  This is repeated until both players have exhausted their hand of cards.&#10;&#10;Next, each player picks up their hand and determines all possible scoring combinations, pegging points again on the cribbage board.  The dealer then picks up the Crib and scores it for all possible points.  Then the cards are shuffled and the deal alternates.  The winner is the first to reach 121 points.&#10;&#10;The origin date listed for this game is approximate.&#10;&#10;";1630;7.10318;1.8983;2;6;30;10;Card Game, Number

When a player makes his guesses a box is handed around and each player puts a chip in the Yes side if his identity was correctly guessed or a chip in the No side if it was not.

2410;Kanaloa;"Two to four players go from island to island to pick up different fruit to give to the gods. Between the islands are fish to move in one direction (to the fish's mouth).

After every move the fish is turned to the other color.&#10;&#10;The gods help the player who gives the most fruit; to move (turn direction or color of a fish), to steal (of course from another player), to determine a volcanic eruption (the players near the volcanic eruption lose a turn) or to pick up better fruit.&#10;&#10;The rules are developed from the theme (character of Hawaiian gods, building small stone temples), but it's not historical.

2426;Hit the Beach;"One of the American Heritage Command Decision Strategy Games.&#10;&#10;A World War II Pacific Campaign game, the players are in a race with each other to reach the &quot;final objective&quot; -- the main Japanese HQ. The Japanese defense forces (14 pieces) are obstacles for all players; when defeated, they are redeployed by that player and can thus be used to slow down opponents.&#10;&#10;Each player has 6 pieces (2 Marines, 2 infantry, 1 naval landing support ship and 1 strategic air support aircraft). On a player's turn, they roll the die and can move one of their soldiers. The support pieces (ship/aircraft) move only on a 6 and are immediately deployed where necessary to support a beach landing. Moving a soldier on top of an opponent's by exact count &quot;relieves&quot; it and sends it back to its start space. Each player must clear the two beaches that match their color. To do this, both support pieces must first be brought to bear, and then a Marine must reach the defender by exact count. Once cleared, beaches remain clear and can be used by all players.&#10;&#10;The mechanics are a variant of the old public domain game of Malefiz or Barricade.&#10;&#10;";1965;5.33046;1.125;2;4;60;10;Wargame, World War II
2428;Battle-Cry;"One of the American Heritage Command Decision Strategy Games.&#10;&#10;This one is the American Civil War game.  Each side has 22 pieces (10 infantry, 10 cavalry and 2 artillery), and the starting positions are fixed.  The grid is square, with no diagonal movement allowed.  On your turn, you roll two dice for movement, resulting in between 2 and 12 movement points to allocate.  Infantry moves 1 per pip, cavalry and artillery 2 per pip (a one-square move still consumes 1 pip).  Mountains force pieces to pause (they must stop until the next turn).  Railroads link stations and can be used to accelerate movement (one station per pip).&#10;&#10;Combat is handled by lining pieces up (horizontally or vertically) to face (or flank) an enemy column.  You must have battle strength superiority to resolve the battle, and this is done after movement is concluded.  Infantry and artillery have combat strength 2, cavalry has combat strength 1.  The rear piece then jumps to the other end of the combined columns, and the entire enemy army is removed.  To be used, cavalry must have a piece at the front; artillery, if at the rear of your column, eliminates the enemy army without jumping.  Artillery cannot attack by itself.  Double jumps can happen, if the jumping infantry piece ends up facing a lone cavalry.  An open square must exist to jump to, so some map deployments are &quot;safe&quot; --but not against artillery.  However, pieces trapped so they cannot move are also removed as if they had lost a battle, so this strategy can backfire.&#10;&#10;You win by completely eliminating the enemy army --but a player may concede earlier when a loss becomes unavoidable.  The four player game splits command of each army in two, and is played in partnerships.&#10;&#10;A really good game, combining a historical theme with rather abstract mechanics.&#10;&#10;";1961;5.58478;1.625;2;4;60;10;American Civil War, Post-Napoleonic, Wargame

2438;LNL: Laplace, Newton & Lagrange;"BoneGames produces a number of do-it-yourself free games.  You download a PDF containing rules and components, and print out what is required for play.&#10;&#10;LNL - Laplace, Newton &amp; Lagrange (briefly known as DeltaVee in its early stages) is a game of ship to ship combat in outer space.  Using a unique movement system that forces players to deal with momentum, and a fast and simple combat system, LNL is a great addition to the space game genre.&#10;&#10;The game involves combat between the Moon and Earth, with individual ships represented by each counter.  Each side has from 3-8 ships.  Each ship has a log covering armament, fuel, engines and defence.  These logs are reminiscent or the Task Force Game 'Starfire', but have fewer options, but a more sophisticated layout.&#10;&#10;The heart of the game is a vector-momentum system (like the one in Yaquinto's Shooting Stars or SPI's Vector Three).  Ships have a facing, use fuel to thrust towards the current facing, but speeds carry over from turn to turn.  Therefore ships can only decelerate only by turning and thrusting in the opposite direction of travel.  Speed is marked by placing numbered counters in the relevant direction.&#10;&#10;Combat involves the use of missiles, guns (i.e. projectile weapons) and lasers.  Missiles are launched and move much like ships.  They are more manoeuvrable, but have a limited amount of fuel, used for acceleration and turning.  As a defence ships may have point defence weapons.  Guns and lasers are ranged weapons, with different arcs of fire, but essentially the same resolution.  Damage is assessed by throwing the requisite number of dice - any dice will do, or  even coins - the game using an EOR (even/odds randomiser) - with odd rolls yielding a hit.  Damage is then marked off the ship, with the affected area depending on the side through which fire was taken.&#10;&#10;Each side (Moon and Earth) has a choice of 8 types of ships and 5 basic scenarios are available, each with a great deal of flexibility.  Tactics can be involved and subtle.  The  interplay of weapon types makes this an exciting game.  It is easy to learn and has great variety.&#10;&#10;";1994;5.67;2.0;2;2;90;12;Print & Play, Science Fiction, Wargame
2440;The Way;"BoneGames produces a number of do-it-yourself free games. You download a PDF containing rules and components, and print out what is required for play.&#10;&#10;The Way is a two-player strategy game played on a 5x5 grid of cards, which are rotated and replaced to form paths to move upon. The first player to get to his destination, to find The Way, is the winner. The Way is very simple to play, but deviously so. Can you be the master of The Way?&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to get from your Start card to your Midpoint card and back again. By rotating and replacing cards, you try to open a Way for yourself whilst closing your opponent's. A game normally consists of three rounds of play. Several variants are listed in the rules.&#10;&#10;";1994;5.366;1.3;2;2;30;8;Abstract Strategy, Print & Play

You download a PDF containing rules and components, and print out what is required for play.&#10;&#10;Tiles is an abstract card game for two or three players.  Players play tiles to try to close areas of their colour to score points.  The larger the closed area, the more points scored.  The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;There are 45 square tiles, each subdivided into four triangular areas which are either white, black or gray.  Each player is assigned a colour.  Tiles must be played so the edge colours match already-played tiles; if one cannot play any tile, one must discard instead.  You can score only on your own turn.&#10;&#10;";1995;5.72286;1.0;2;3;30;8;Abstract Strategy, Print & Play
2444;Carrier Strike!;"This game pits two aircraft carrier task forces against each other; each player has two carriers loaded with 6 torpedoes and 4 aircraft.  Pilots are represented by ratings which are embarked on the aircraft when launched.  The carriers move with a special die which gives each carrier a 50-50 chance of either moving forward one or turning 60 degrees.  The aircraft move with a normal d6.  If they manage to manoeuvre at torpedo run distance from an enemy carrier (6 hexes), drop their torpedoes.  These move inexorably one space per turn so the only defence is manoeuvring.  If the aircraft get within dogfight distance of each other (4 hexes), they may engage in a dogfight, which uses cards (a better pilot rating gives you extra cards) --it also forces the torpedoes to be dropped, so sacrifice dogfights are a viable tactic.  If you run out of torpedoes, you may kamikaze your aircraft.&#10;&#10;An amusing tactical simulation, very simple and fast-playing, with nice bits to boot.&#10;&#10;Remade in to Mission Command Sea.&#10;&#10;";1977;6.08445;1.4286;2;4;45;8;Miniatures, Nautical, Wargame, World War II
2446;Chopper Strike;"In this game, each player manoeuvres a fleet of helicopters and a fleet of jeeps (equipped with AA guns), trying to gain air or ground superiority.  That is to say, you win by wiping out all of your opponent's choppers or all of his jeeps.&#10;   A d3 indicates how many pieces you will move, and a d6 how far each one will move.  Choppers move on the elevated &quot;air&quot; board, whilst jeeps stick to the ground.  Terrain obstacles complicate matters for the jeeps at the players' &quot;border&quot;.  Choppers take choppers out by jumping over them (&agrave; la checkers); they can also take jeeps out by bombing them (stopping right above them).  Jeeps take jeeps out by landing on them; they can also take choppers out using their AA guns (stopping right below them).&#10;&#10;";1976;5.34178;1.4783;2;2;45;8;Aviation / Flight, Miniatures, Modern Warfare, Wargame
2448;Kalah;"The most common rule set in games sold commercially as Mancala is for this game of Kalah. Mancala is actually a whole family of games. Kalah was invented in 1940 by an American, William Champion Jr..  He started selling the game in 1944, patented the rules in the 1950's, and founded the Kalah Game Co. in 1958.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a board of two rows, each consisting of six round pits. The rows have a large store at either end called the Kalah. A player owns the six pits closest to them and the Kalah on their right side.&#10;&#10;The game is started with four (4) seeds in each pit. A player takes all the seeds from one of their pits, and then they are distributed one by one, counterclockwise, in the pits and the player's own Kalah, but not into the opponent's store (Kalah). If the last seed is dropped into an opponent's pit or a non-empty pit of the player, the move ends without anything being captured. If the last seed falls into the player's Kalah, they must move again. If the last seed is put into an empty pit owned by the player, they capture all contents of the opposite pit together with the capturing piece and puts them in their Kalah. If the opposite pit is empty, nothing is captured. A capture ends the move.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player no longer has any seeds in any of their holes. The remaining pieces are captured by their adversary. The player who has captured the most pieces is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;Variants:&#10;&#10;Beginners may start with 3 seeds in each pit, but the game can also be played with 5 or 6 seeds in each pit. William Champion Jr. recommended the expert game with 6 in each pit.&#10;&#10;In the Philippines Version (called Sungka locally) the game is often played with small shells, there are 7 pits on each side as well as the Home and the game is started with 7 shells in each pit.&#10;&#10;";700;5.99664;1.5979;2;2;10;5;Abstract Strategy
2450;Deuce;"These 52 cards, 11 cards (0 through 10) in each of 4 colour suits plus 6 Rainbow cards and 2 X cards.  You try to go out (empty your hand) during each hand; score is kept and the first player to reach 100 wins.&#10;   Each player is dealt 6 cards.  You begin by placing two cards of your choice in front of you, face up, to create two discard piles.  The two cards played must match either by colour or by number.  In turn, you play one card from your hand onto any of the discard piles.  To play onto a pile, the card played must match the other pile's card in number or colour.  If you can't or don't wish to play a card, you must draw cards until you can play one.  Should the draw be exhausted, a new deck is made from the discard piles, keeping only the topmost cards.&#10;   To go out, your discard piles must at least tie all the others in number value.  Score is 10 points for the player who went out, plus the combined values of the cards left in the other players' hands.  The discards aren't scored.&#10;   Rainbow cards are wild, being of all four colours at once --they match any card.  The card value is zero, which may be handy to reduce an opponent's discard piles value.  X cards (also worth zero), on the other hand, can only be matched by Rainbow or X cards.&#10;&#10;";1985;5.46585;1.0;2;6;20;8;Card Game, Math
2452;Jenga;"Jenga is tower building game played with 54 wooden blocks; each block is 3 times as long as it is wide, and slightly smaller in height than in width. The blocks are stacked in a tower formation; each story is three blocks placed adjacent to each other along their long side, and each story is placed perpendicular to the previous (so, for example, if the blocks in the first story are pointing north-south, the second story blocks will point east-west). There are therefore 18 stories to the Jenga tower. Since stacking the blocks neatly can be tedious, a plastic loading tray is included.&#10;&#10;Once the tower is built, the person who built the tower moves first. Moving in Jenga consists of taking one and only one block from any story except the completed top story of the tower at the time of the turn, and placing it on the topmost story in order to complete it. Only one hand at a time may be used to remove a block; both hands can be used, but only one hand may be on the tower at a time. Blocks may be bumped to find a loose block that will not disturb the rest of the tower. Any block that is moved out of place may be left out of place if it is determined that it will knock the tower over if it is removed. The turn ends when the next person to move touches the tower, although he or she can wait 10 seconds before moving for the previous turn to end if they believe the tower will fall in that time.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the tower falls in any significant way -- in other words, any piece falls from the tower, other than the piece being knocked out to move to the top. The loser is the person who made the tower fall (i.e. whose turn it was when the tower fell); the winner is the person who moved before the loser.&#10;&#10;The same game concept was published in 1984 by Fagus under the name &quot;Hoppla - eins zuviel!&quot; According to the designer, the game was developed from Takoradi blocks/bricks. &quot;Jenga&quot; is Swahili for &quot;build&quot;.&#10;&#10;";1983;5.65434;1.104;1;8;20;6;Action / Dexterity, Party Game

Then play begins.  You use dice to move your pawn, but cards are required to move through house rooms --otherwise you're confined to the sidewalks (without the right cards, you may also end up &quot;trapped in a garage&quot;, the only room that does not have a direct exit to the sidewalk).

2464;Swords & Sorcery: Quest and Conquest in the Age of Magic;"[SPI Advertisement c1978]&#10;&#10;SWORDS AND SORCERY&#10;Quest and Conquest in the Age of Magic&#10;&#10;- Separate Army and Quest Game, plus Role-Playing Version&#10;- Full Background &ldquo;History&rdquo; and Characters&#10;- Professionally Illustrated by Tim Kirk&#10;&#10;The Valley of the Great Sword is a much warred over area on a small planet in a trinary system many lightyears and eons removed from Terra.  Superficially, there is no great difference between this highly prized region and any other coveted area that nations have fought over since time immemorial.  But the Valley, and indeed the whole planet, guards a secret so valuable that few off-planet visitors that have visited that remote corner of the galaxy have all been mercilessly killed.  For the Valley is an area of great magicks, where technology has all but disappeared.&#10;&#10;Long ago in the Age of the Great Upheaval (which not even the oldest of the denizens of the Valley can recall), the Council of Wizards abolished all weapons that were more advance than those used in Earth's Middle Ages.  This was because (most scholars have it) mages could be killed by long range weapons before they could employ their defensive spells, and greatly feared the advent of mass-produced technology.  But the population of that world trusted mages no more than you and I, and there followed a series of great wars which succeeded in devastating all areas of the planet with the exception of the Valley (called Ararlve by the ancients).&#10;&#10;A great meeting was held at the Altar of the Elder Gods, and its purpose was to determine whether the Human race should be allowed to survive.  The Dragons, The Swamp-Creatures and the Spiders all vociferously argued for the extermination of all mortals, as they greatly feared the return of wizards who would be able to challenge their power.  But the Elves and Dwarrows who are kin to Man showed mercy, and the meeting finally resolved that mortals would forever be excluded from the Valley.  Grisha, then the greatest among Dragons, prophesied that the Elves and Dwarrows would meet their doom at the hands of Men.  This so enraged Gwaimallion Elflord that he joined Grisha in mortal combat and slew him on the spot.  As Grisha died he pronounced his deathcurse upon Elves and Dwarrows, &ldquo;My prophecy shall come true within three Ages!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;It was a shaken group of creatures who adjourned the great meeting.  But none would for get Grisha's curse, and many sought to destroy Men in any way possible.  Even some of the Elves and Dwarrows, fearful of the prophecy, sought to kill Men wherever they might be found.  But the human race is a hardy one, and is not so easy to eliminate.  For an entire Age, Men throughout the planet barely survived, running from their many oppressors.  But when the Second Age dawned, the other races began to accept Men, and rudimentary civilizations developed.&#10;&#10;Since the beginning of recorded time, all races have shown equal adeptness at handling manna, the energy from which all magic emanates.  But only the race of Man can create power items, which are great storehouses of manna.  And with these power items the race of Man evolves superhumans adept at handling the items.  It is this chain of events that all other races fear, for a united human race can defeat all other inhabitants of the world combined once they reach this stage.&#10;&#10;And so, at the beginning of the Third Age A.U. (After the Upheaval), the race of Man began to dominate once again.  The reappearance of Wizards and the conquest of half the world occurred in less than one century.  The Elder Races recognized this threat for what it was, but they were unable to co-operate amongst each other due to age-old differences.  The situation became dire when the various nations coalesced into the Second Empire.  Soon all lands but the Valley were Human-controlled.&#10;&#10;The Valley, root of the most powerful magic, from which the power of Man stemmed, now ironically provided refuge from Man.  The Valley could not be tamed by Man, and in its own defense it produced great amounts of manna.  At this point, forces of the Empire invaded the fabled city of Urf Durfal on the outskirts of the Valley and sought to conquer it in one swift stroke.  Leading the charge into the Valley was Emperor Coron the Unconquerable, and his defeat at the hands of Zurik Bladebreaker Dwarfking signaled the rebirth of the ancient races.  But that was not all, that was coming back to the Valley.  Two great and evil wizards each sought to be the Dark Lord, while a renegade noble sought to establish a separate nation in the heart of the Valley.  Contact was made with the inhabitants of the daemonic plane, and all sorts of demons, minor and major, roamed the Valley.  To cap it all off, discovery of several of the ancient and most powerful power items occurred.  The Empire had a most formidable challenge.&#10;&#10;Swords and Sorcery is a game portraying the climactic period of the War against the Elder Races.  The Army Game, which deals with the &ldquo;historical&rdquo; battles of the war, uses a fairly simple combat system so that the Players may better explore the detailed spell lists, the Diplomacy rules and the various game mechanics that deal with all the elements necessary to fantasy.  Twelve Scenarios, beginning with the aforementioned Coron's campaign in the Valley and concluding with the final attempt to capture the Valley by the Empire, deal with all the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; fantasy situations.  Each Player is given control of an army and one or more Characters.  While the individual army units are important, it is the Characters who dominate the Army Game, by their leadership and (for those with magical abilities) their spell-casing abilities.&#10;&#10;Also included in the Swords and Sorcery package is a Quest Game, which involves the Players using the various Characters during periods where there is a lull in the War.  A Player will be given a specified number of Characters and objective, and seeks to perform better against the nasties or villain than his opponent(s).  Of course, your brave fighter may be vanquished by a fearsome troll before he is able to battle the guardian of the sword he seeks, or your Magic User may be defeated by a Spectre.  There are great perils in the Valley.  It will not do for a Dwarf to go merrily traipsing through the provinces of the Elves, else he be captured and need to be rescued by his kindred.  But a band of battle-hardened adventurers can defeat nearly any threat that besets them &ndash; the challenge is to avoid the death of one or more of the brave questers.  All of these possibilities are handled by such rules as the expansion of the spell list, a detailed personal combat routine, and even a Section on how to create your own character, if those provided with the game do not satisfy.&#10;&#10;Swords and Sorcery includes a 22&rdquo; by 35&rdquo; game-map which portrays the Valley of the Great Sword, 400 four-color counters which represent many different races &ndash; Human, Elf, Dwarf, Goblin, Hobgoblin, Spider, Dragon, Swamp-Creature, Cronk, Demon and Monster &ndash; that live in or intrude upon the Valley, 56 illustrated cards, consisting of 40 Character illustrations, 10 Magic (or Power) Item illustrations, and 6 Monster illustrations, and a lengthy rules booklet including an extensive fantasy background.&#10;&#10;Swords and Sorcery represents the culmination of over a year's work, and includes a wide range of fantasy elements.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;This fantasy wargame is really two games in one. The Army game uses SPI zones-of-control and a combat results table. Forces include elves, dwarves, orcs, spiders, swamp creatures and a host of others set in a fictional valley on a fictional world. Some of the more exotic inclusions are memorable for their pun value:  Unamit Ahezredit, Logarithm Son of Algorithm; places such as the Evelyn Woods and the Stream of Consciousness, as well as the notorious Hills of Avalon; and peoples such as the Corflu (Correction Fluid) Cultists, the (communist) Orcish Revolutionary Council, and the dreaded Killer Penguins.  X the Unknown could potentially conjure the SS Wiking Division. The Quest game is concerned exclusively with characters and is akin to a role-playing game.The game appeared with two covers: a blue box with a Tim Kirk illustration and a red box with a John Butterfield illustration. The games are otherwise identical.&#10;&#10;";1978;6.98526;3.2258;2;7;180;12;Adventure, Fantasy, Wargame

2466;Freeze Frame!;"The board consists of a 3x3 felt grid on which move eight wooden tokens (four of each of two colours).

Black does the same in turn.  Every time the pattern formed by your pieces matches that shown on one of your cards (you're allowed to orient the cards freely), you shout &quot;Freeze Frame!&quot; and score that card.  You then replace the card with a newly drawn one.  First player to score five cards wins.  Play can be prolonged either by going for a larger number of cards or by going through the entire deck of 34 frame patterns.&#10;   Each card shows four white dots and ignores the opponent's piece deployment, so you're really playing two different games at once and just getting in each other's way.

2467;Zillionaire;"This game is a close relative of The Great Dalmuti and Dilbert's Corporate Shuffle. In it, each player is ranked (and seated) according to his wealth (Poor / Thin Ice / Credit Crazy / Upper Crust / Money to Burn / Rich).&#10;&#10;The entire deck of 62 cards is dealt out, minus two cards. The first and last player exchange two cards, the next-to-first and next-to-last exchange one. The player to the left of the dealer (the Rich player) begins by playing a set of cards (quantity and face value). The following player can either play the same quantity but higher value or pass. This round continues until all pass; after which another round starts. Players rank (for the next hand) in the order in which they go out.&#10;&#10;Score is kept for the agreed upon number of hands (no more than 10). Poor scores 1, Thin Ice 2, etc. High score wins.&#10;&#10;Interestingly, the value 5 cards are wild in the sense that a single 5 can represent any number of fives. When played to start a round, the following player determines the quantity. The other cards are Zillionaire (4 in deck), Millionaire (4), Bankroll (3; if played on top of a Bankrupt card, cannot be beaten), Bankrupt (3; can only be beaten by a Bankroll), Bump (3; forces the player to your left to Pass), 8 through 1 (6 of each except for Fives, of which there are only 3).&#10;&#10;";1987;6.00208;1.0;3;6;45;8;Card Game
2468;Zero Zap;"The object of this game is to score Sets and Runs of cards and trying to go out first. First to score 50 wins.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt 7 of the 108 cards. On your turn, you either draw 1 or 2 cards, or pick up one or more cards from the playing area (more on this later). Then you play your sets (3 or 4 cards of same color and value) and runs (3 to 7 consecutive cards of the same color) or increase already played sets and runs. Finally, you must discard a card; special cards are truly discarded once their effects are resolved; the other cards are discarded to the playing area, slightly overlapping each other in sequence. When you pick up a card from the playing area, it must be used to play a run or set and you must pick up any cards that follow it (were discarded after it).&#10;&#10;Going out scores a 5-point bonus and ends the round. All played sets and runs score (sets are worth 2 per card; runs are worth 1 per card); cards left in hand penalize you 1 point per card.&#10;&#10;The number cards (84) come in 3 colors and run from 1 to 7 (there are four of each). Wild cards (6) can replace any number card but cannot be played to form their own sets or runs. Double cards (3) are used to double the value of all of your sets and runs of a given color. The Special cards (14) do various things such as reshuffling the draw and discard decks, stealing a set, run or double, giving a card away, etc. The Zero Zap card (1), if left in your hand when someone goes out, zaps your score for that round to zero (Yikes!). However, if played as a Special to go out, it zaps someone else's (of your choosing) round score!&#10;&#10;";1987;5.30952;1.0;2;4;45;8;Card Game
2469;Wildcatter;"&quot;The Authentic Oil &amp; Gas Exploration Game&quot; has an educational aspect to it, as the drilling success ratios, drilling depths, costs and monthly production figures were taken from the real world.&#10;&#10;The game is played within the U.S. and Alaska; the players lease properties and drill for oil and gas, trying to get rich.  On each lease, you must decide whether to go for shallow or deep wells --once a well has been drilled, even a dry hole, all future drilling must be done at the same depth, even if the lease changes hands.  The first few wells are Exploratory and have lesser chances of success; once a producing well has been drilled, further drilling is Developmental.  When you land on a player's lease, you buy its monthly oil production from him; landing on your own lease nets you double that amount (paid by the bank).  Payments also roll in every time you go around the board.&#10;&#10;Random events are injected by Wildcat and Blowout cards.  The rest of the game falls in line with what its design is: a Monopoly clone.

2470;The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen;"This not-quite-a-role-playing-game requires players to sit around telling fantastic (but completely true!) stories. Players may attempt to trip up another player's story by wagering a token (&quot;But the Prussian Army had dissolved by that time, m'lord, so you could not have possibly fought it single-handedly&quot;), whereas the storyteller must counter with another token (and an excuse) or swallow their pride and incorporate it into their story (with another excuse). There are also a few, minor details, mostly used to get boring storytellers to stop. The game is won after each player has told one story. Each player, in turn, gives *all* their tokens to another player they believe has told the best story--so collecting the most tokens doesn't make you the winner, it makes you be able to choose the winner. Of course, the best story-telling wins the game.&#10;&#10;Re-published 2002 (starting at Essen) by Krimsus KrimsKrams-Kiste as Die unfasslichen Abenteuer des Freiherrn von M&uuml;nchhausen.&#10;&#10;Is also listed on RPGGeek as The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen&#10;&#10;";1998;7.25103;1.4643;3;20;45;10;Adventure, Party Game

Russian units are Corps, German units are a mish-mash of battallions, brigades, and a few regiments. The map has two scales, an operational-scale covering the Elbe to the jump-off lines on the Oder, and a &quot;grand tactical&quot; map of Berlin itself. The system is a fairly straightforward and standard hex/ZOC/CRT system vaguely reminicient of Masahiro Yamazaki's previous game, Stalingrad Pocket from The Gamers.&#10;&#10;";2001;6.53731;3.0;2;2;360;12;Wargame, World War II

2476;Industrial Waste;"Industrial Waste is a fast but deep game designed by J&#195;&#188;rgen Strohm in which the players are running factories. Players buy materials, complete orders and invest money in technology improvements to earn VPs, but they need to keep an eye on their waste output. If players have too much waste in their factory dump they are liable to suffer an environmental disaster and have to pay hefty cleanup costs. Development of technological improvements requiring less waste, fewer resources, and reduced workforce are the key to this game.&#10;&#10;The game features bidding for resources, hand management and some drafting of cards to gain actions. The first player to grow their factory to a value of twenty triggers the end and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;";2001;6.665;2.6301;2;4;60;12;Economic, Environmental, Industry / Manufacturing

Players alternate activating formations.&#10;&#10;The rules are in French and are complete, although somewhat murky at times. The game may have benefited from a more rigourous editing effort.

Strive to be the first player to make three dominant QUIRKS.  Match wits against opponents who threaten your survival.  But BEWARE!  If three of your QUIRKS become extinct, you've lost the game.&#10;&#10;In Quirks, players build unusual plants, herbivores, and carnivores by combining cards that show one of three segments of that plant or creature. Each card is of a particular quirk: a distinctive trait that may give a bonus. Players attempt to create the dominant species of Plant, Herbivore, and Carnivore in the current niche for that turn's climate type -- Ocean, Forest, Plains, Desert and Jungle.&#10;&#10;Included are rules for solitaire play, but otherwise Quirks is good for 2-4 players using the standard game.  There are also simplified rules for Quirklings, a streamlined version of the game designed for children of ages 7-11, which can handle 2-6 players.&#10;&#10;";1980;6.10202;1.9714;1;4;45;7;Animals, Card Game, Environmental, Prehistoric
2479;Candidate;"A U.S. presidential election game.  Players move from state to state.  Each turn a player draws 2 of 3 possible cards: campaigning, fundraising, or dirty tricks.

They hunt and gather food, make their tribal laws, and deal with natural disasters, but the object of the game is simple: Look after the children! In this game, the way to win is to have the most kids and do whatever you have to do to make sure they survive to adulthood. The players must know when to cooperate, and when to cut their losses and protect their own families. Players can re-create &ndash; and change &ndash; the earliest human societies by instituting their own laws and social patterns, and see what effects the rules of society have on their ability to survive and reproduce.&#10;&#10;With several copies of the game and a referee, it's possible to have several tribes playing at once, competing, trading, exchanging members, and even making war on each other.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.5271;2.0769;4;8;240;0;Prehistoric
2482;Zaxxon;"The galaxy is in peril! The evil robot Zaxxon and its legion of followers have conquered an asteroid belt! It's your job to ward off this threat before it's too late.&#10;Published in 1983, the Zaxxon Board Game was one of Milton Bradley&rsquo;s numerous attempts to translate video games to board games.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY THE GAME: &#10;1. ROLLING THE DIE: both players roll their die AT THE SAME TIME. Reroll the die if there is a tie. On EACH turn, the player rolling the Lower Number on the die ALWAYS plays first. Then the player rolling the Higher Number plays second. &#10;2. USING THE SPINNER: the player rolling the Lower Number spins the spinner. The spinner controls enemy fire directed at fighter planes from missile silos and gun turrets (later in the game the spinner will also control the movement of Zaxxon). When RED is spun, any plane that is in or enters a missile silo area CONTAINING A MISSILE SILO is shot down and returned to its home base. When BLUE is spun, any plane that is in a gun turret area CONTAINING A GUN TURRET is shot down and returned to its home base. If a missile silo or a gun turret has been shot and removed from the board, there is no enemy fire from that area so any planes in that area are safe. Notice that the missile silo areas are surrounded by a red border and the gun turret areas are surrounded by a blue border. See Figures 5A and 5B for locations. When WHITE is spun, all planes are safe. Please Note: if your plane is shot down by a missile silo or gun turret in the inner fortress, return it to a RESTART space in your outer fortress. &#10;3. ORDER OF PLAY: after spinning the spinner, the player who rolled the Lower Number moves his or her plane or planes according to the die count just rolled. Then the player who rolled the Higher Number moves his or her plane or planes according to the die count just rolled. You can move one of your planes the full amount on the die or move both of your planes, splitting the die count between them in any combination&#10;4. HOW A FIGHTER PLANE MOVES: a fighter plane can move from one space to any adjacent space by die count as shown in Figure 6. A plane can change direction or land on the same space more than once on the same turn. A plane cannot pass over or land on a space occupied by another plane. A fighter plane can &quot;fly&quot; at High Altitude or Low Altitude by raising or lowering it on its base. Each change in altitude (either High to Low or Low to High) counts as ONE on your die count. Your plane must be at Low Altitude to shoot a target and at High Altitude to cross a wall.&#10;&#10;HOW TO WIN THE GAME: &#10;Be the first player to destroy your enemy targets and shoot Zaxxon with both of your fighter planes.&#10;&#10;";1982;4.37138;1.1818;2;2;30;7;Aviation / Flight, Children's Game, Fighting, Science Fiction, Video Game Theme

2484;Explore Europe;"A travelling game through Continental Europe.&#10;Each player begins in a home city and draws 8 cards for other cities they must visit by a combination of land, sea and air travel. Roll a die each turn for movement, with players trying to choose the optimal routes. The first player to visit all their cities and return home wins.&#10;&#10;The limitation of using only 1 mode of transport per turn, as well as increasing cost for air based on distance, increases the analysis and decisions required. Certain 'special' city cards also provide benefits (extra turn, free movement, etc.) or penalties (miss a turn, mandatory travel).  With 180 cities on the board, there are multiple paths to choose each turn, and no two games are ever the same!&#10;A Ravensburger Family game.&#10;Note: The rule book also includes educational information about notable attractions for the 63 'special' cities.&#10;&#10;";1954;5.12059;1.375;2;6;30;9;Children's Game, Educational, Racing, Travel

2486;Flipop;"The Flipop board consists of a 5x5 grid of spaces.  In each of the 16 intersections between four spaces, there is a post holding a door that can swing around so that it blocks access between any adjacent two spaces of the four spaces around it.  Each player has five balls on his side of the board.  The object is to move the balls across the board, at which point they are removed from the game.  To move, you must push a ball through a door.  If there is a ball in the space beyond the door, it will be pushed -- this can cascade indefinitely.  But a move is only legal as long as each ball lands either in an empty space or goes through another door -- balls cannot touch each other.  The winner is either the first person to remove all his balls from the board, or the player with the fewest balls left when no legal moves remain.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.86842;1.5;2;2;20;0;Abstract Strategy
2487;Why;"&quot;Alfred Hitchcock presents...The Game of Why&quot;&#10;&#10;Once upon a time, six people on their way to a costume party took shelter from a storm in a haunted house...And were never seen alive since.  But they still haunt the house.  You must try to find out who was murdered, by what means and why.&#10;&#10;The cards include Motive cards, No Clue cards and a single &quot;It's a Mystery to Me&quot; card.  In addition, there are cards that can be assembled side by side to form larger pictures: the six guests (Cleopatra, Napoleon, etc. --they were costumed, you see; in four pieces), four weapons (also in four pieces) and Alfred Hitchcock (in six pieces).  Seven cards are dealt to each player, the rest into the house's rooms.  You enter a room by exact count, except that a 7, 11 or doubles allows you to go directly to the spot of your choice.  When you reach a room, you pick up the top card there and discard either it or another card from your hand to the &quot;Lawn&quot; --off the board.  These cards are laid face down without overlapping each other but are shown to the other players as they're laid down.  Later, you may try to recover a Lawn card by showing a card from your hand of the appropriate type (a piece of a guest, for example) and then pointing to a Lawn card and picking it up.  If you remembered right, you may repeat the procedure.  You can also claim cards from other players by meeting them in the house and &quot;accusing them&quot; of withholding a particular card (this is what the No Clue cards are defence for).  Once the rooms are empty, everyone gathers in the hall and play is speeded up.&#10;&#10;First player to assemble a Ghost, Weapon and Motive OR Alfred and &quot;It's a Mystery to Me&quot; wins.&#10;&#10;";1958;5.73407;1.2222;2;4;45;12;Memory, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Murder / Mystery

It sets out from the arrival of Carthage in the fourth century BC, follows the footsteps of Roman, Germanic, Byzantine and Muslim conquerors, and finally takes part in the early reconquista of the Christian kingdoms of Castile, Leon, Aragon and Portugal.&#10;&#10;Hispania adapts the basic system of Britannia and re-locates it to Ancient / early Medieval Spain and Portugal, adding and changing some rules along the way. The actual time period covered is 320 BC to 1220 AD.&#10;&#10;In Hispania advanced rules, the players try to outbid each other in an auction for up to 30 different tribes and peoples.

2496;Saloon;"Premiering at Essen 2001, a card game of brawling in a Saloon of the Old West. The attacker plays his cards and the defender responds.  The first noninvolved player to get a card to the table can throw in a punch as well.  If any of the attack gets through, the defender takes some knock out points.  But if he's not yet in Dreamland, now he gets the turn to strike back, or does he find a new target?  Plenty of warping effects on these easy-to-explain rules and interesting flavor are added by cards such as the roundhouse, whiskey bottle, flying through the window, beer barrel, piano player, Oopsadaisy and the dreaded bartender (he comes with a club).  Players gradually get knocked out until there is only one brawler left standing, the winner.&#10;&#10;Components include 6 Schl&auml;ger [&quot;Brawler&quot;] cards (one for each player), 54 Saloon cards (24 Attack cards, 8 Item cards, 6 Hit cards, 3 Help cards, 8 Defense cards, 5 Event cards).&#10;&#10;";2001;5.02632;1.0625;3;6;30;10;American West, Card Game, Fighting, Real-time
2497;Goldrush-City;"Premiering at Essen 2001, a game of gold digging and city building. Players take turns revealing event, resource and bandit cards from the deck. After the events are resolved, the players bid for the resources. Then the active player uses his action points and resources to acquire building permits, acquire tools or erect buildings which differ in their resource costs and advantages conferred. Bandits may also be used to further the player's goal, but may backfire if the dice are not friendly. Then players engage in a subgame somewhat akin to Blackjack -- but with a greater range of results -- to distribute gold useful for the next auction. What's tricky is to take in more gold diggers than anyone else, but not to take so many that the ensuing brawl wipes out all of the profits. The eventual winner is the player who has managed to construct the best set of buildings with bonuses for achieving multiple buildings of the same type.

The board is much like a Scrabble board, including spaces equivalent to &quot;double-word score&quot; and &quot;triple-letter score&quot;.  The difference is that, instead of placing words formed of letters, players of Equate place equations formed of numbers and symbols on the board.

Cards represent typical chess pieces, and the board is defined by the rows of cards originally laid out.  Throughout the game players capture each others' pieces as in normal chess, but can continually add to the board from the cards they hold in their hands.&#10;&#10;Additional rules, such as the pawn combo (after moving a pawn, you can make a second move through or into the vacated space), add new elements over classic chess.  Pawn combos together with piece limits and placement restrictions serve to balance the value of the different pieces.

2501;Global Chess;"Global Chess is pure chess with 64 squares, traditional pieces and traditional moves. The game of chess was developed when armies fought on open fields in distinct formations and the entire battle could be seen from a single vantage point. As warefare and technology have advanced, battles are fought over the limb of the horizon with no edges to the battlefield. This is the transformational premise of Global Chess. There is no backline and no sideline on the Global Chess board. There is nowhere to hide.&#10;&#10;Think of a 64 square chessboard wrapped around a globe. Now you can play chess around a sphere with no edges to the game. The problem is that it's difficult to see all the squares at the same time and understand your options. The Global Chess game separates the globe at the equator and flattens them into hemispheres that are geared together. By turning the game you rotate the hemispheres against each other to examine the crossing point of a piece in it's possible trajectories across the hemisphere or through the poles. Turning the board does not alter the relationship of the game pieces to each other.&#10;&#10;The easy to understand rules of chess as they pertain to a global playing surface are explained in text and graphic form. The possible strategy is yet to be written! The board is annotated to record game play.&#10;&#10;";1997;6.34211;5.0;2;2;90;12;Abstract Strategy

2507;Liberté;"Libert&eacute; covers the French Revolution from 1789 and the meeting of the Estates General to the Directory and Bonaparte&rsquo;s coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat in 1799. &#10; The game is played in four turns. In each turn there will be a variable number of rounds, followed by an election to see which faction becomes the government. There are three factions, the Radicals (red), the Moderates (blue), and the Royalists (white).  The most common action is for a player to place faction blocks on the board.  He shows he controls these blocks by placing one of his tokens on top of the stack.&#10;&#10;The cards are divided into two sets, set 'A' and 'B'.  The 'A' deck is used first and tends to favor the moderates and Royalists.  Once this deck has been exhausted the 'B' deck comes into play, which tends to favor the radicals.&#10;&#10;The election is triggered when all of one type of faction block has been exhausted.  The faction blocks will determine which faction forms the next government.  Players are attempting to score victory points by having the most influence in the government and opposition.  Points can also be picked up in later turns for being the general in charge at a victorious battle, and for winning elections in specific provinces.&#10;&#10;Normally the player with the most victory points will win.  However, there are two sudden death game end conditions that may alter the outcome.  The first is a radical electoral landslide, triggered by the red faction gaining 17 or more votes.  The second is  successful Royalist counter-revolution, precipitated by Royalist control of seven counter-revolutionary provinces.  In both cases, victory is determined by a different set of criteria, in which accrued victory points do not count.

2509;Dark Heaven Apocalypse;"Dark Heaven: Apocalypse (DH:A) is a miniatures game set in the fantasy world of Adon.  Players assume the roles of commanders of armies of fantastic races such as humans, vampires, dwarves, elves, etc., fighting among themselves and against the ultimate villains, the Dire-Dead, who are led by the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.&#10;&#10;In DH:A, the 10-sided die is used to generate the random results to determine the outcome of battles, spells, and incidents.  Players build up armies of equivalent point values to fight each other.  The point value of a basic unit can be cheap, but can be increased by giving the unit better weapons, skills and spells.  Players are free to customize the standard units presented in the rulebook or create their own.  Rules also cover artillery, morale, chariots and elephants.&#10;&#10;The battles are split into turns, which are further split into class movement phases (where increasingly more mobile units act ahead of slower ones).  During a turn, Class 1 units (the most mobile) act first.  The player who won the roll for initiative at the start of the turn enacts his or her orders for her Class 1 units before the opponent moves theirs.  They then repeat the same for their Class 2, Class 3, and lastly Class 4 units.  Individual figures can be grouped together with a leader in combat, supporting their leader in its fight and dying together with it if its roll fails against an opponent.&#10;&#10;The winning conditions for a battle can include total destruction of the enemy, seizing an objective, or fleeing the battlefield after being surrounded.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.35714;2.3333;2;2;300;14;Adventure, Fantasy, Miniatures, Wargame
2510;Playboss;"Playboss is an exciting board-game that simulates the many real-life business situations in which directors and managers make their decisions. Each player in this game is a businessman who has the opportunity of buying machines and raw materials, selling his products, paying taxes, raising loans or introducing rationalization schemes, and generally experiencing the ups and downs of everyday business life.&#10;&#10;Before starting, players agree the duration of the game. The player with the greatest net assets at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;The board comprises a circuit of 42 spaces of 5 different types: decision spaces on which the player can choose to buy raw material, purchase capital equipment, manufacture goods or sell goods, research &amp; development spaces which allow investment for productivity improvement or risk reduction, risk spaces which require the drawing of a risk card, additional cost spaces, and depreciation spaces.&#10;&#10;Each player has a factory card on which are placed machines, computers, raw materials and finished goods. At the start of the game, priced slots in the center of the board are filled with the goods: these slots are emptied and filled as goods are bought as raw material and sold as finished goods. The buying and selling price is determined by the next available filled or empty slots, though players can bid competitively for the purchase or sale.&#10;&#10;The Economy Game uses the basic mechanism and many features.&#10;&#10;";1969;6.3354;2.5294;3;9;180;16;Economic, Industry / Manufacturing, Negotiation

2513;Colony;"This game was developed as a German / English / French joint venture to develop an educational game  about colonialism.&#10;&#10;Each player is a colonial power, all arriving on the same continent at the same time. The continent is divided into regions, most of which are coastal. Each player starts with one settlement, a 'resource' and a port    somewhere on the coast.  A turn consists of simultaneously selecting an action (at the start from four: colonise, build ship, build port, explore/prospect) Then in turn - Collect Income; Execute action; Take and execute an event card.  The length of an epoch is governed by the number of event cards, so the        more  players, the fewer actions you get.The victor is the player with the most money at the end of the last epoch.&#10;&#10;";2001;4.89474;3.0;2;6;360;0;Civilization, Economic, Exploration
2514;Skyline;"Players take turns moving their own Helicopter pawn around the board to land on an unoccupied square. Individual board squares may be colored to match one player&rsquo;s color, or in a neutral color. The color of the landing site indicates which player (whether or not that is the active player) places one floor of a new building at this square.&#10;&#10;The active player must then pay points to owners of all buildings over which the Helicopter has just flown. The pay rate is based on the total floor count for each color involved, and escalates steeply with increased floor count.&#10;&#10;Turn ends with one additional floor of the appropriate color being added to each building flown over.&#10;&#10;Some players may be eliminated early when unable to pay.  Game ends when one player cannot move (cannot reach an empty square), or when one player has no more floors to place.

2516;Man O' War;"Man O' War is the game of Raging Sea Battles in the Warhammer World. As an admiral of an ocean-going war fleet you must command your ships - which can be either squadrons of Ships of the Line or heavily armored Men O' War and Independents, in the battle for supremacy of the high seas.&#10;&#10;Players choose fleets from the multitude of races of the Warhammer world. Every ship is represented by a template showing individual areas, each with a description of the items (masts, cannons etc.) in those areas - as well as the damage that they can take before being destroyed. Each location has a value that must be rolled to hit that area when attacked, along with another value that can be rolled by the defending player to possibly prevent any damage that might occur. Ships are classified one of three ways. They are either Ship of the Line (SOL) - which are designed to move as a group of three (each moving and fighting to completion before continuing on with the next ship in the squadron), a Man O' War (MOW)- which are single ships that are much larger, more powerful and crewed by larger numbers than a single SOL classed ship, or finally as an Independent (IND) - which are used individually like a Man O' War but are more in line in strength and abilities to that of a Ship of the Line.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each turn, players determine Initiative by each rolling a die which determines who will go 1st in each phase - if the numbers are different, or how the wind direction changes if they both roll the same number. If the wind changes, the initiative roll and resolution is repeated until one player wins the die roll.&#10;&#10;Players then conduct the Magic Phase with each Admiral having his Wizard make one spell attempt if desired based on the Initiative order previously determined. If a spell is successful, the other player can try and dispel that spell just cast - but only if they have a corresponding type of magic to make the attempt.&#10;&#10;Next comes the Battle phase - which is also based on the previously determined initiative roll. Players alternate between phases of Movement/Combat, each choosing a single MOW, IND or SOL Squadron and then conducting movement (if desired) and/or making attacks, before passing the turn sequence back to their opponent. This process continues until all ships have been activated on both sides. Once that has occurred, the turn is over and a series of quick turn ending/record keeping events occurs before moving to the next turn. Game play continues for a predetermined time or until one side is destroyed, surrenders or flees the battlefield.&#10;&#10;The Main Boxed set contained 2 sets of 3 Wargalleys for the Empire and another 2 sets of 3 Wargalleys that were considered Pirates. THe main rules also included Fleet Lists and specific rules for each of the 6 Warhammer Races included in the game: The Imperial (Empire), Bretonnian, Dwarf, High Elf, Dark Elf and Orc. Each Race had had unique features, weapons and abilities that made every battle a new challenge for both players. Rules for a Campaign as well as additional pieces like playing pieces like Shoreforts were also included in the main ruleset.&#10;&#10;There were two separate expansions to the main game. The first was Plaguefleet which added rules and templates for the Chaos fleets of Khorne, Slaanesh, Tzeentch and Nurgle (collectively known as a Plaguefleet), the Skaven and finally the Chaos Dwarfs. This expansion effectively doubled the number of available fleets for the game. This expansion also included color templates for the original 6 races as well (Imperial, Bretonnian, Dwarf, High Elf, Dark Elf and Orc).&#10;&#10;The 2nd expansion Sea of Blood mainly introduced new rules for Airpower, Sea Monsters &amp; Beasts and Allies as well as new ships for the Dwarfs and Imperial fleets. The inclusion of the Norse fleet wrapped up the content for this expansion.&#10;&#10;Finally, complete rules for an Undead fleet - as well as some expansion rules for a few of the other races, were included in several of the issues of Game Workshop's Citadel Journal magazine.&#10;&#10;A wide variety of miniatures were produced to represent the many ships detailed in the main game and expansion sets but no miniatures were ever officially made for the Undead fleet. Assembling and painting the miniatures gave the game a feeling of being &quot;collectible&quot; as well as being a hobby in itself. Many players have created customized ships and new ships (and even complete fleets) including rules, ships templates and completed miniatures. The largest collection of these creations is housed at Groups IO and there is a very active Facebook Page as well.&#10;&#10;Man O War is still considered by many GW fan's as one of Games Workshop's best games. The wide variety of different ships, rules for each race and relatively small investment to get up and running contributed greatly to Man O War's popularity. Even today, fans scramble to find copies of the games and with the rise in accessibility to 3D printing, getting a fleet (or two) for this out of print game has never been easier.&#10;&#10;";1993;7.18083;2.6613;2;4;180;12;Fantasy, Miniatures, Nautical, Wargame
2518;Quicksand;"The object of the game is to be the first player to get your adventurer around the board from START to the finish line back at CAMP.&#10;&#10;Along the way, you&rsquo;ll encounter Mudslides that may set you back and hanging vines that may swing you ahead.  You&rsquo;ll try to grab onto Handholds and land on Safe Rocks to keep your man high and dry.

To represent your sinking into the quicksand, you remove his feet, then his waist, and so on until only the pith helmet remains!&#10;&#10;You actually start already partially mired (by an initial die roll); every turn you move forward a number of spaces given by your height, plus an optional movement die.

2524;StarForce 'Alpha Centauri': Interstellar Conflict in the 25th Century;"Adapted from the box:&#10;&#10;The game is a simulation of events within a conjectural future history in which telekinesis is used to move ships through space. It is played on a map which displays 74 star systems in a three-dimensional &quot;sphere&quot; of space measuring roughly 40 light years in diameter, with Earth's home system at the center. A grid of hexagons printed over the map is used to regulate movement and position of pieces.  Pieces' exact locations are not known until they &quot;meet&quot; in the same three-dimensional &quot;hex space&quot;.&#10;&#10;The pieces in the game represent groups of four interstellar spaceships (StarForces) and space stations (StarGates). Each Player maneuvers his pieces (via Stellar Shifting) to engage those of the enemy. Movement is plotted and executed simultaneously. The game proceeds this way (for a specified number of turns) as the players try to achieve the objectives set forth in the rules. No prior knowledge is required to play the game - just a little ingenuity and common sense.&#10;&#10;Battles take place when units are in the same three-dimensional location.  In the Basic Game, the attacking Player compares the total variable strengths of the involved units and consults a simple probability table to determine the outcome of each battle.  In the Advanced Game, a small tactical maneuver map is used. When enemy forces engage on the main map, they are transferred to the tactical display. Here they move (in three dimensions), attack and defend using a fixed number of action points per tactical turn.&#10;&#10;Combat outcomes result in pieces not being destroyed but being &quot;randomised&quot;; usually to a location far from all the action.&#10;&#10;&#10;Part of the StarForce Trilogy box set, along with Outreach and StarSoldier. There are also special rules to use Starsoldier as a tactical game for StarForce.&#10;&#10;";1974;6.4098;3.4444;1;3;240;12;Science Fiction, Wargame

Each amulet is also worth one point. The zero value cards have no amulets themselves, but double the amulet count for that suit, or quadruple them if both 0 value cards in that suit have been won.&#10;&#10;Ten cards are dealt to each player, and the rest are split into two equal draw piles, face down, in the center of the board. The draw piles are spread out so that the backs can be seen, showing the color of the suits. Players must also hold their cards so that the backs are visible.&#10;&#10;Each round the start player plays up to three cards face down, (but never three of the same suit), and the other players must follow in turn with the same number of cards in the same distribution, or pass. There is no requirement to follow suit in general, but if, for example, the start player puts down three cards in three different suits, the other players must also play three cards in three different suits. The last player is restricted to suits that have already been played. Anybody who passed draws 1-3 cards from the two draw piles in the center. A battle is then resolved for each suit that has been played, with the highest card winning the battle and going into its owner&rsquo;s stash of Gargon cards to be scored at the end. The losing cards are discarded and the players draw replacements.&#10;&#10;If anybody played two cards of a suit, a second battle is fought with the weakest of the pair.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one of the draw piles is exhausted, and the current round is played out, then the totals are scored.&#10;&#10;";2001;5.98267;1.7463;3;5;45;10;Card Game, Fantasy

2548;Loopino;"A card-flicking card game in which a target card depicting some tasty fish is placed on the table and players attempt to flick (actually, according to the rules, this is a wrist-toss rather than a finger-flick) cards depicting dolphins as close to the target as possible - the twisting motion of the flicked cards is supposed to represent the playful antics of the dolphins. A crosshair appears in the corner of each card, and distance is measured by the closest crosshair on the flicked card in relation to the closest crosshair on the target card. The number of cards to be scored is determined by the number on the closest card to the target (i.e. if a &quot;4&quot; card is closest to the target, the four closest cards all will score). Each card scores a number of points equal to the face value of the card multiplied by the number of crosshair symbols on the card that remain uncovered. If all four crosshairs on the target are covered, the player covering the last takes a penalty, as does any player causing the target card to fall off the table. Suggested game duration is as many rounds as the number of players; highest point total wins.&#10;&#10;";1997;4.09524;1.0;2;10;10;6;Card Game

2558;Comeback;"Another in the line of very small card games by Reinhard Staupe. The deck consists of four suits of cards numbered 1 to 7. The 1s have three stars, the 2s have two stars and all other cards have one star. Players start with 150 points (which serves as a starting score and a money pool for bidding). For 2 players, use 16 cards, for 3 players use 21 cards, for 4 players use 24 cards (so that players do not know which cards are in play) and these are auctioned off one at a time. Bid increments must be at least as great as the number of the card being auctioned but can be more - i.e. while bidding on a card with the number 4, a bid of four would require a bid of 8 or more from the next bidder). The first bid can be lower, the same or higher than the number of the card.  Bidding goes clockwise around the table.  First bid also moves clockwise around the table. When all cards have been auctioned, suits are scored separately for each player by adding the card numbers and multiplying that figure by the total number of stars in the suit. Scores for each suit are added to any remaining points from a players' starting pool (points remaining from the original pool of 150) to determine the final score. Comeback was nominated for Spiel des Jahres in Germany in 1997.&#10;&#10;";1996;5.88372;1.6;2;4;20;9;Card Game

Each turn, two monster cards are simultaneously revealed - one showing dark-colored versions of the monsters and one showing light-colored versions. Certain combinations of monster sets may only be captured using specific monster-catching devices. As quickly as possible, players check their reference cards to determine which monster-catching device will work for the monster pair currently on display and place the appropriate card in the center of the table.

2574;Classic Warlord;"Originally self published by Mike Hayes in 1974 as &quot;The Warlord&quot; - this edition came in a red box.  It was reprinted by Mike in 1978 as &quot;Warlord&quot; and came in a blue box.  It was released by Games Workshop in 1980 in a smaller version (only western half of the Warlord board) as &quot;Apocalypse&quot;.&#10;&#10;As of October 2012, the game is now available again as Classic Warlord, a limited edition in a gold box, with two sets of rules and an FAQ booklet, counters in pouches for up to seven players and a single large D6, along with the full eight-section mapboard. This version sees the game revert back to the original Warlord with new rules to reflect over thirty years of play.&#10;&#10;Objective - to dominate the board and destroy opponents.&#10;&#10;Mechanics - similar to Risk, you get more armies for the more territories you hold. Allocation is on basis of territory held: city, industrial or agricultural.  Mountainous, waste, and sea spaces gain you no armies.&#10;&#10;Gaining territories through combat is an elegant use of cunning and bluff.  Instead of rolling dice, the attacker simply chooses with a single D6 how many pieces they wish to attack with (subject to restrictions based on terrain).  The D6 is then concealed and the defender attempts to guess it.  If they guess correctly the attacker loses that number of armies; if they guess wrongly one defender is lost, and if the territory is now left unoccupied the selected number of attacking pieces or greater are advanced into the territory to capture it.&#10;&#10;Alliances are allowed (and can be broken at will).&#10;&#10;A-bombs and the more devastating H-bombs are used in the game.  A-bombs are a reward for successful combat, and H-bombs are gained as a result of launching an A-bomb.  These can be placed to act as deterrents against other players, and can be launched to clear enemy territory prior to an advance.  Nuclear damage however will render map spaces impassable for the remainder of the game.&#10;&#10;";2012;7.17318;2.2619;2;7;360;12;Modern Warfare, Wargame
2576;Kampf um Rom: Das Kartenspiel;"The Fight for Rome - the Card Game is the card version of the board game of the same name (Kampf um Rom / The Fight for Rome).  It deals with the preservation, loss and development of cultural achievements in Europe from the 4th to the 10th Century (the transition from the Ancient to the Middle Ages).  Each player pursues the goal of developing as many Achievements of the best quality as possible, by placing his own counters onto the game board.  Disasters and invading barbarians may impede cultural development by the play of cards to ruin specific Achievements.  The winner will be the player who has collected the highest combined value of Achievements (as he is leading the way into the Middle Ages).&#10;&#10;";2000;5.575;2.0;3;4;45;12;Card Game, Civilization, Wargame

Each of these dice is numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, W, W in the four colours.&#10;&#10;In a turn, the player starts by rolling all ten dice.  The player may then set aside any dice he wishes to keep.  He makes a second roll with the remaining dice.  He may set aside some of these dice, adding them to those already set aside; he may also take back some of the dice previously set aside.  Then he makes a third and final roll, scores and ends his turn.&#10;&#10;Each phase specifies which dice are needed (sets, runs, flushes), so this is sort of sequential Yahtzee.&#10;&#10;";1993;5.35387;1.1571;1;8;30;8;Dice
2580;Persian Gulf: Battle for the Middle East;"Persian Gulf: Battle for the Middle East:&#10;&#10;Persian Gulf uses the same rules as the other games in the Third World War series to show a different aspect of modern warfare operations in the deserts and mountains of the middle east.&#10;&#10;Persian Gulf includes a special &quot;game within a game&quot;, covering the diplomatic, political, and military maneuvers by the Soviet Union and the United States in the Middle East before - and leading to - the general outbreak of the Third World War. Both sides try to gain control of the various Iranian factions and influence the other Middle Eastern nations. As the superpowers' confrontation continues, fighting breaks out between committed factions. Either side can decide to send troops to support their factions; the U.S. may send the Rapid Deployment Force while the Soviet Union may use its forces along its southern borders and in Afghanistan. Each move, however, escalates the conflict until the superpowers are directly fighting one another in the Middle East and their alliances in Europe are mobilizing for war.&#10;&#10;The four game maps cover the Persian Gulf region in detail. Centered on Iran and Iraq, the maps include bordering areas of Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the USSR, and Afghanistan. Mountains and sand dominate this area of the world, and wilderness rules show the effects of the scarcity of roads on military operations. &#10;Vying for control of the nations on these maps are the regional forces and those of the superpowers. These forces range greatly in capabilities: from the poorly-equipped and trained Iranian Revolutionary Guards and Soviet-controlled Afghan Army to the capable Turks to the elite Israeli and Jordanian intervention contingents. The Soviets have large forces available in their southern border regions and in Afghanistan. The small but strong U.S. RDF is on hand, and they can call on B-52 strikes for support.&#10;&#10;The rules cover the special political and military situations of the Middle East and the various Arab and Arab-Israeli rivalries are shown. Victory conditions take account of the oil resources of the Gulf. Additional rules allow Persian Gulf to be combined and played with the other three games in the Third World War series.&#10;&#10;";1986;7.40206;3.4815;2;2;300;12;Modern Warfare, Wargame

2590;Temptation Poker;"Sid Sackson's Temptation Poker is a variant of the card game Poker.  In this variant, players can purchase additional cards to improve their hand.&#10;&#10;Each player receives the same amount of credit to start the game.  After anteing 5 credits, they are dealt the standard 5-card hand, and taking turns, they can look at and purchase up to 6 cards at increasing costs, e.g. 1 for the first additional card, 3 for the second, and so on, to improve their hand.  The credits they used to purchase the cards go into the pot.  After everyone had their chance to improve their hands (or had quit the round by folding), they reveal their improved 5-card hands and the player with the best hand (according to standard poker rules) takes all of the pot.  The next round then starts, repeating the anteing-and-improving-hand process.&#10;&#10;The game stops when one of the players cannot afford the ante; at that point, the player with the most credit is declared the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;";1982;5.856;1.5;1;6;45;10;Bluffing, Card Game

2596;Villa Paletti;"An architectural rush to the skies for 2 - 4 budding architects with a good head for heights from 8 years old.&#10;&#10;In the land where the Lemons bloom, there once lived a wise old sage, whose friends called him &quot;Paletti&quot; He only had one goal in life, to finish the wonderful castle in the sky that his grandfather had begun to build many years before, but which had been left unfinished when the ducats ran out. Paletti too had little money, but instead he had a marvelous plan. Why buy new columns when he could re-use the old ones that his Grandfather had built?  All he needed to do was remove some of those holding up the first floor, of which there were far too many in any case, and rebuild them further up, so that they could support new floors,  reaching up towards the skies!&#10;&#10;&quot;Excellent, Paletti&quot; shouted his friends, and they quickly started to work.  Soon they had a marvelous building in front of them, the &quot;Villa Paletti&quot;. Nowadays, no one knows what it was caused the collapse of the Vila Paletti, perhaps a puff of wind, or a slight earth tremor, but all the experts are united on one point, that Paletti,  far ahead of his time, was the first to discover something whose full importance is only now starting to become clear to us, the Euro pallet!&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Palazzo Paletti&#10;    Menara&#10;&#10;&#10;";2001;6.41687;1.1603;2;4;30;8;Action / Dexterity, Children's Game, Party Game
2598;Tank Battle;"The object of this game (a distant relative of Stratego) is to destroy your opponent's six tanks before he does the same to you.  In addition to your tanks, you deploy an Ammo Dump, a Fuel Dump, your HQ and five Anti-Tank guns (which do not move).&#10;&#10;Your tanks are numbered but the opponent knows not which is which.  You also deploy (by writing their coordinates on a scrap of paper) two land mines.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you first plot secretly (using a peg board) where you think your opponent's tanks will end their move.  Once you're ready, he moves.  If you guessed correctly, the tanks are killed.  (You get six such shots each turn)  You also have five special shots which can be fired only once each --they may be added piecemeal during any turn.  You lose a special shot whenever you lose an AT gun.&#10;&#10;You have 6 moves each turn, no more than 3 per tank (unless down to two or fewer tanks).  Tanks can only go sideways or forward but those that reach the opponent's starting row are marked with a flag and can now move backward.&#10;&#10;Tanks attack each other by orthogonal proximity, in Stratego fashion (higher numbered tank wins).  Tanks attack AT guns using a spinner.  The installations are destroyed by being overrun.  Losing the HQ clears your mines; losing the Ammo Dump means you only use as many pegs as you have tanks remaining; losing the Fuel Dump reduces your movement points from six to four.  Tanks die if they end up on an enemy mine square.&#10;&#10;Remade in to Mission Command Land&#10;&#10;";1975;5.53976;1.6458;2;2;30;8;Wargame, World War II

2602;Solitaire for Two;"Solitaire for Two includes two games: one called Six-Suit Solitaire that was originally released as Indochine 2000, and a second titled Solitaire for Two that (despite the title) can be played with 2-4 players.&#10;&#10;Six-Suit Solitaire is a modified version of the solitaire game Klondike, with six suits in the game instead of four as well as three jokers (one in each color). As in Klondike, players try to remove all tiles from play by creating stacks from Ace to King, but unlike in Klondike players have an incentive to keep Aces in play rather than removing them; if a player has one Ace in play, then he can move Queens to empty columns in addition to Kings, and with two or more Aces in play he can also move Jacks to empty columns. A player can place only the rightmost tile in the &quot;talon&quot; &ndash; the row of exposed tiles from the stock &ndash; but if he cashes in a joker, he can move any tile in the talon to the rightmost position.&#10;&#10;Solitaire for Two plays similarly to Six-Suit Solitaire, but the players take turns drawing tiles from the stock &ndash; three at a time &ndash; and trying to place them in the layout and score as many tiles as possible. Players score points for each tile they lay off; for playing all three tiles drawn; for moving columns of five, seven, nine or eleven tiles; and for other specialized situations. The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;";2001;6.67939;2.2;1;4;45;13;Card Game, Puzzle

2606;Dover Patrol;"This game DOVER PATROL by Harry Gibson is a wonderful Naval themed and early version of a type of hidden tactics game of skill. It was sold alongside the similar L'Attaque and Aviation: The Aerial Tactics Game of Attack and Defence and a more complicated game called Tri-Tactics designed as an incorporation of all three, by Gibsons and marketed together at the time as Series: The Big Four (Gibsons).&#10;&#10;Note: L'Attaque was patented in 1909 in France by Mademoiselle Hermance Edan, the U.K. distribution rights for which were acquired in 1925 by Gibsons. Dover Patrol was launched in 1911, whereas the original H. P. Gibson & Sons company was registered in 1919. Prior to that, The International Card Company operated between 1903 and 1919, when Harry Percy Gibson purchased ICC to form his company. Whether Harry Gibson designed the game is therefore open to some doubt.&#10;&#10;The game play of Dover Patrol is very much like L'Attaque, which forms the basis of the near-identical game Stratego by Jumbo, published in 1946 after World War II when the patent would have expired. Gibsons themselves had to effectively &lsquo;start again&rsquo; around that time having had their premises destroyed in the Blitz.&#10;&#10;The board, which supposedly represents an area of sea, is superimposed with a rectangular grid. A Base is shown on two of the opposite edges of the board. The area round each base is protected by a harbour wall.&#10;&#10;Each player has a fleet of forty playing pieces. These pieces are rectangles of cardboard which stand upon plastic supports. The two sides are distinguished by the colour on the back of each card, red and blue in this case. The fronts of the cards depict various ships, mines and a flying boat. Each piece has a printed value from 1 for a Patrol Vessel to 10 for the Flagship. These values represent the relative strength of each ship and also indicate the type of ship; battle cruisers, light cruisers, etc.. The ships are also named, H.M.S. Lion, H.M.S. Glasgow and so on. The object of the game is to capture the enemy Flag and transport it back to one's own base while still retaining possession of one's own Flag.&#10;&#10;To start the game, the players place their Flag on their Base and then set up their pieces, one per rectangle, on their own side of the board and with the backs of the cards facing the opponent. In turn the players move a piece one space orthogonally until two opposing pieces are back-to-back. The moving player may then call 'Attack', the two relevant pieces are then revealed and the one with the lower value is sunk and removed from the board.&#10;&#10;In addition to the fighting ships, the players have a number of auxiliary pieces. Mines will automatically blow up virtually all ships that are moved into an attacking position, regardless of whether the owner of the moving ship attacks or not. Once placed, mines may not be moved. Only the mine sweepers can destroy mines. The mine layers act as floating mines. They can be moved but may not attack, but have the same effect upon enemy shipping as a mine. Only the destroyers can sink them. Submarines have a marauding role and can sink all ships except mine layers and MTB's. The good old flying boat has a very important role as it is principally used to capture the enemy flag because it can fly over the harbour walls. Only MTB's and destroyers can shoot it down. When the opposing flag is captured, it is clipped to the top of the capturing piece and thus its whereabouts are known to all. The Flag can be transferred to any other piece standing orthogonally adjacent to the piece which is transporting it.&#10;&#10;It is a fairly straightforward game to play, though tactics can well be employed, particularly in the setting up phase.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    L'Attaque&#10;    Aviation: The Aerial Tactics Game of Attack and Defence&#10;    Tri-Tactics&#10;    Stratego&#10;&#10;&#10;";1919;6.19028;2.1111;2;2;180;12;Nautical, Wargame, World War II
2608;King Oil;"This MB game comes with a plastic &quot;board&quot;.  Its size is dictated by the three randomizing discs embedded in its base, which are used to generate a new playing area every time (there are 1,728 (12^3) different setups possible).&#10;&#10;You buy properties, drill for oil, link properties with pipelines so as to collect royalties and try to be the richest player.  Event cards complicate matters.  Drilling is resolved with a little rig whose plunger is pushed up if it doesn't go through the hidden disc; if it pushes through all three, the well is dry.  Deeper holes cost more, of course.&#10;&#10;Pipelines can be bought once you have 4 producing oil wells on a property; they reach across that property's boundary to another player's property, and are used to siphon royalties from him every turn.  This is a clever mechanic that accelerates bankruptcy and keeps total playing time within reasonable limits.&#10;&#10;Once all players but one are pushed into bankruptcy, the remaining one is the winner.&#10;&#10;";1974;6.10175;1.6585;2;4;60;9;Economic, Industry / Manufacturing

2618;Westwärts;"On his last long ride through the wide and wild West, the experienced expedition leader McTrucker realizes that he's getting too old for the job &ndash; but who will take his place? One of the greenhorns accompanying the current expedition?&#10;&#10;To find out which of these greenhorns might be best for the job, McTrucker gives each of them a mission on the final day of the expedition &ndash; and to make sure he finds out how they fare against one another, the missions all bring them into competition with one another. Only the one who can enforce his will best over the others and best deal with unexpected situations will merit being appointed expedition leader.&#10;&#10;To set up Westw&auml;rts, twenty wagon cards &ndash; along with settlers, gold mines and even a scout, barber, preacher, teacher, cook and gravedigger &ndash; are placed beside a munitions wagon. Five cards each are randomly distributed on four area cards (pastureland, desert, Indian country and mountain country). Thirty job cards can be completed, four of which are laid out face-up with a reward of 1-3 gold nuggets for each when completed.&#10;&#10;The progress of the wagon train is controlled by cards, with each player holding three in hand. While game flow is simple, fulfilling demands is not always so. Each player places a movement card face down. The current player reveals his own and that of another. With these two cards, he then resolves the wagon train movements and tries to fulfill jobs. The game ends when a player has earned 15 nuggets or fewer than four incomplete jobs remain. Some jobs are simple with small payoffs while a more difficult one would require, for example, equipping one area with three settlers and two gold diggers or placing the preacher between a settler and a gold digger. In such cases, often the second card is of no help unless players make special arrangements with one another: You scratch my back, I scratch yours. Special cards do things like eliminate or paralyze certain wagons due to fire or broken axles.&#10;&#10;";1995;5.16667;0.0;2;6;60;10;American West, Transportation
2620;Schwimmer in der Wüste;"In English the title means Swimmers in the Desert which for some will give away the &quot;setting&quot; as that of the novel and film, THE ENGLISH PATIENT.  The situation is that of the beginning of the film.  Players secretly place swimmers on individual boards with the aim of recreating the exact placement of the swimmers on the game board.&#10;&#10;The game is played with 19 small rocks in grey, brown, yellow or white and beautiful handmade materials, and is performed in two parts.  During the first part the stones are placed onto the playing field via auctions.  Two stones at a time are drawn from the bag and auctioned by having each player bidding using one big and one small card.  The small cards have a value from 1 to 3, the big from 1 to 12.  The player with the highest product of the two cards may place both stones onto the board.  The big card is removed from the game, the small card will stay open until the last card of the same type is played.   Only after 3 bidding rounds will you get more small cards in your hand.&#10;&#10;The idea is to place the stones in the right order, which is stated on the card you have hidden from your opponents. You may score a row or column five times during the game even when it isn't your turn. When both color and position match you you place a so-called &quot;2F&quot; or &quot;3F&quot; marker at the row/column which will bring you 2 or 3 points for each correct stone - which can amount to quite a good score in the long 5 stone row. If only the color, but not the position, is correct you use the &quot;2A&quot; or &quot;1A&quot; markers.  One or two points per stone won't get you far, especially in the short 3-stone row, but the most important aspect is not to use the markers too soon.  Firstly, because you cannot score a particular row/column more than once, secondly because you can get your points in the second half of the game.&#10;&#10;When all stones have been placed onto the board the second half of the game beings.  Here you may rearrange the stones. Before the game is over you may you exchange two stones with each other five times.  You shouldn't use your 2- or 3-marker on the short rows/columns, but rather concentrate on the longer. The board has two 5-, four 4- and four 3-rows, and if you don't get the maximum points early in the game will you have to look foolishly on as your opponent places his markers on the two 5- and three of the 4-rows to score maximum points.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.0;0.0;3;4;0;0;Movies / TV / Radio theme

Afterwards the second player takes one of the remaining dice and moves his pawn. Then the third player follows, etc.  The last player in a round must take the last remaining die.&#10;&#10;Once all players have moved the start player rolls the large white die and move the Phantom accordingly.&#10;&#10;Then all the dice are passed to the next player in a clockwise direction who follows the same procedure.&#10;&#10;The Phantom&#10;The player who rolled the black dice in this round moves the Phantom.  After all players finish their turns with the black die, he rolls the white die and moves the Phantom in any direction.  Afterwards the next player in a clockwise direction receives all the dice and the next round begins.&#10;&#10;How Does the Phantom Move?&#10;The Phantom leaves his Start place in any direction.&#10;The Phantom may land on and over wall spaces and can also stop there. Phantom can move through rooms. It enters and leaves a room from any space.  The room represents a space and costs one point of movement.  The Phantom may not enter the End Space or a Violin Space.  He also may not move over them.&#10;&#10;The White Phantom Die&#10;It shows 1 - 5 pips and a Phantom.  The pips mean that the Phantom is moved a corresponding number of fields. If the white die shows the Phantom, the Phantom must be moved into an arbitrary room.  Then the player throws the white die one more time and the Phantom moves that number of spaces from the new room. The Phantom is an Obstacle. No pawn may land on or pass through a space that the Phantom is standing on.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the player that possesses a Violin and the required number of Roses can enter the End space.

2638;Clash of Giants: Campaigns of Tannenberg and the Marne, 1914;"Clash of Giants contains two separate games (both using the same basic system) covering the two most famous battles of the opening phase of the First World War. Tannenberg was the German victory that halted a Russian offensive into East Prussia and destroyed the Russian 2nd Army. The Marne was the climactic battle of Germany's attempt to defeat France in the war's first six weeks. Arguably a tactical draw, it was a strategic defeat for the Germans as their armies recoiled from the gates of Paris.&#10;&#10;Designed by eight-time Charles S. Roberts award winner Ted S. Raicer (whose most recent game was GMT's Paths of Glory), and developed by Krieg designer Steve Kosakowski, the Clash of Giants system is intended to emphasize playability while still providing players with proper historical feel. The games focus on the difficulty of commanding groups of armies, with a system where movement allowance for each army is separately determined by a command roll.&#10;&#10;Clash of Giants includes the standard and exclusive rules (including rules for Paris Taxis at the Marne and Geman wireless intercepts at Tannenberg), two full size large-hex maps, two player aid cards, and 264 large counters. Units are divisions and brigades.&#10;&#10;Simple but not simplistic, Clash of Giants has a unique combat system based more on a unit's training, equipment, and morale than numbers. In Tannenberg, the victory conditions force both sides to take risks - and the German player will have to use every advantage to avoid being crushed by superior Russian numbers. At the Marne, the Allied player will first have to successfully disengage and rally his French and British armies, before turning to deliver a powerful counterattack. (But don't forget that the Germans can win instantly if they take Paris!)&#10;&#10;The two battles in Clash of Giants [...] are good for solo or competitive play. The Marne (which contains an Allied Counterattack scenario in addition to the full campaign) can be played in an afternoon. Tannenberg can be completed in a couple of hours, making it the perfect game when time is short.&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE:    1-2 days per turn&#10;MAP SCALE:     4.5/3.3 miles per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE:     Divisions and brigades&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS:     One or two&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;&#10;        264 full-color counters&#10;        Two 22&quot;x34&quot; full-color mapsheets&#10;        8-page Rulebook&#10;        12-page Battle Book&#10;        2 Player Aid cards&#10;        One 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;&#10;(from GMT Games website)&#10;&#10;";2001;6.85149;2.2917;2;2;180;12;Wargame, World War I

2644;Who Framed Roger Rabbit?;"Based on the movie, this game's object is to discover your opponents' identities, find the Will and return to your home space.&#10;&#10;On your move, you roll two dice (black and white); you move as indicated by the white die (1-6), adding the black die (1-3) if you choose to.  Movement around the board can be accelerated by the Trolley or by Benny the taxi cab (each uses his own special die to move, which boils down to a 1 in 6 chance of stopping --this mechanic pervades the game as you'll see).&#10;&#10;Identities can be guessed by looking at cards set up on the board; each shows half a character's picture, in a player colour.  Once you've seen both halves of a given colour, you're allowed to guess that character as that player's identity.  Each correct guess allows a search for the Will, checking the Confidential cards that lie on the Dip Cannon circle.  Once a player has grabbed the Will, the others go after him and forget about identity-guessing.&#10;&#10;You can steal the Will by Dip Cannonning the Will-holder, by sending a Weasel after him or by landing on him by exact count.  To use th Dip Cannon, you use your (one and only) Dip Cannon card or one of the Judge Doom cards you've previously found, then roll the Dip Cannon die.  Each &quot;Dip&quot; rolled turns the cannon one space towards your target; the &quot;cancel dip&quot; die face stops the process altogether.  If you successfully Dip him, he drops the Will and is sent back to any home space.  Weasels work in similar fashion, the Weasel token starting beside your token and moving towards its quarry with each successful weasel die throw.  Used Weasel cards may be recovered by landing on a special space in the Dip Cannon circle.&#10;&#10;";1987;5.06429;1.5;2;4;60;10;Deduction, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Murder / Mystery

2654;Snap;"The Snap deck consists of 60 cards in 4 color suits. The cards are numbered front and back from 1 to 15. The game is played in two phases. In the &quot;cool phase,&quot; players draw and discard cards in turn order, with the stipulation that the discarded card must be higher in value than the one drawn. This continues until one player is satisfied with the mix achieved in his/her 7-card hand and calls &quot;Snap.&quot; At that point, the &quot;hot phase&quot; begins, with players slapping cards at will - although one at a time - on the discard pile. When two cards with with matching color are placed one over the other, that suit becomes the winning suit. Players then score points for cards of that color in their hand. Players also score for all other cards of any color with numbers matching their winning-suit cards remaining in other players' hands (except for cards valued 10 and above). It is suggested to play as many rounds as players in the game, with the player achieving the most points overall winning.&#10;&#10;";1997;3.44444;0.0;3;5;30;10;Card Game

2658;Integralis: Die große Keilerei in der Buchbinderei;"&quot;Integralis - The big free-for-all at the bookbinding shop.&#10;&#10;Integralis is a game about the bitter fight to fulfill jobs. In this game, you are the leader of a project team in a bookbinding shop. Together with your team (your cards) you try to handle the mountain of incoming job. There are small orders, which are relatively easy to fill but yield only small profit, and big orders, for which a great deal of work must be done. Big jobs also bring big profits, however. The prize that our team receives for a successfully completed job is dependent on the number of tasks. However, the number of machines is limited and the competition among the teams is rough. No methods are shunned in the constant effort to keep away opposing workers or hinder their performance, not even bribery or sabotage. The only thing that matters at the end of the game is which team has the most money.&quot;&#10;-From English rulebook&#10;&#10;";2001;5.75;2.0;2;4;60;16;Card Game, Economic

2664;Push Over;"The players race around a circular track to accumulate points.  The player pieces are mounted piggyback on neutral &quot;carriers&quot;.  On your turn, you roll up to three dice (1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3), aiming for 4 or less --one die at a time.  If you get 4 or less on two dice, you move twice the amount, if you get it on three, you move thrice.  If you total more than 4, you're busted and your piece goes off board, plus a chip is added to the pot (initially seeded with 1 chip).  As pieces move, they push those in front of them on the track.  There are two exit tracks where you get to push pieces over the side.  Whenever this happens, you also add a chip to the pot.  You can get back on track only if there is a carrier piece available.&#10;&#10;As you pass the pot, you grab the chips there (and seed it again with a chip).  First player to 10 chips wins.&#10;&#10;";1981;5.15476;1.25;2;4;20;6;Racing
2666;A Mighty Fortress;"Subtitle of the game: &quot;Reformation and Counter-Reformation, 1532-1555&quot;&#10;&#10;On the box cover: &quot;The time is 6 February 1531.&quot;&#10;&#10;One of the games in SPI's Power Politics series.&#10;&#10;From the publisher:&#10;&#10;Recreating the turbulent era of the Reformation, from the viewpoint of political/religious interaction and military activity. A Mighty Fortress is designed with a mechanical simplicity that is matched only by the subtlety of the game's interplay among contesting forces.&#10;&#10;A Mighty Fortress simulates the conditions, which made possible the spread of the Lutheran Reformation and the subsequent Catholic reaction (the Counter-Reformation) in the years 1532-1555. The game recreates the actual historical objectives of the major countries in Europe in the Sixteenth Century as well as their military strengths and resources. There are six players in the game representing the six major countries, England, France, the Ottoman Empire, the Hapsburgs, the Pope, and the collection of German states we will call The Lutherans.&#10;&#10;The Lutheran player is intent on promoting the Protestant cause throughout Europe, and the Papacy is equally resolved to gather any straying nations back into the Catholic fold. The Hapsburg Empire -- strong in arms and sprawling across half the continent -- seeks to maintain its possessions in the face of pressure from all directions. In England, Henry VIII is engaged with his own confrontation with the Pope; and French forces are marshalling to dismantle the Hapsburg dominions. And Suleiman the Magnificent is constantly watching for the opportunity to expand his Ottoman empire -- at anyone's expense.&#10;&#10;The Hapsburgs have, by far, the largest number of combat forces. Unhindered by other problems, they could easily suppress Lutheranism. However, other players have objectives that can usually be achieved only at the expense of the mighty Hapsburgs. Therefore, depending on the rapidly shifting political situation, there will probably be several alliances against Hapsburg influence. Because of this convoluted political situation, the players will often find themselves at cross-purposes with other players whom they were aiding the Game-Turn before. Thus, the possibilities for political and military interaction are extensive.&#10;&#10;A Mighty Fortress covers the twenty-four years from 1532 to 1555 -- a period fraught with shifting alliances, political and religious fervor, and frantic efforts to shift the balance of power. Theological debates, treaties of peace, declarations of war, excommunication, taxation, and missionaries -- all are included in this simulation of one of the most violent and implacably hostile eras of European history. The game covers all actions from the year 1532 -- right after formation of the Schmalkaldic League -- until 1555 and the Peace of Augsburg, which guaranteed Lutheranism as a religion [sic] and allowed the German estates to choose between that and Catholicism.&#10;&#10;Other notes:&#10;&#10;Special rules include those for missionaries, conversion, peace treaties, formal alliances, truces, ultimata, ceding territory, income and borrowing, theological debates, excommunication, Henry VIII's divorce and hidden, variable victory conditions.&#10;Counters = 200&#10;&#10;Other credits:&#10;&#10;Graphic Design: Redmond A.

Everyone writes answers to each question, and everyone whose answer agrees with the majority is &ldquo;right.&rdquo; However, other players will be trying to guess what you will answer, so maybe you should give the answer you think is right. If you&rsquo;re not careful you&rsquo;ll find everyone asking, &ldquo;What were you thinking?&rdquo;&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to guess the most common answer (by the current players) to each question.

It is mostly a commodity speculation game; not only do the players need to get good prices on the spices that they are bringing back to Europe, they also need to lay in supplies in order to keep their ship on the move.  Obtaining the money to buy  supplies requires selling spices to regions other than the spice's region of origin; and in this case, a player wants the spice price to be high.&#10;&#10;Event cards add a random aspect to the game and there are pirates prowling the waters who are out to ruin a captain's best laid plans.&#10;&#10;Title translates to &quot;The Spice Route&quot;.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.67705;1.25;2;5;90;8;Economic, Nautical

2700;Rauchzeichen;"Reichzeichen (Smoke Signals) is a set collecting memory game.  There are two types of square cards - &quot;narrow smoke&quot; and &quot;wide smoke&quot;. On the reverse side of the wide smoke cards are various landscapes. The narrow smoke cards contain horizons (end caps, think El Caballero)and clouds. A stream of nine cards is placed rising up from a fire;  the narrow smoke cards are always face down, the wide smoke cards are first shown to everyone and then placed face down.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you point to one of the wide smoke cards from spaces 4-9 (not the first three next to the fire) and claim what it is.  If correct, you take it and keep going until you miss.  The smoke raisings (?? don't know what this means!) the smoke raisings????....) with each card taken and new cards are added to the bottom.  Alternatively you can take a narrow card.  If it is a horizon, you take it and your turn ends.  If a cloud, the rain gets closer and this paces the game.  You need horizons to score so you will take this action often.&#10;&#10;You score by creating complete landscapes.  Each wide smoke card gets 5 points, narrow smoke cards get 1, and there are bonuses for special collections of landscape cards.  The game uses money simply, making you pay the previous player if you take the card they incorrectly identified. In close games the money at the end can be influential.&#10;&#10;";2001;4.83333;0.0;2;5;45;8;Memory

2713;James Clavell's Noble House;"From the Publisher:&#10;&#10;Noble House is a game based on the novel by James Clavell. In this game, players take the part of the Tai-Pans of major corporations doing business in Hong Kong in the early 1960's, as portrayed in the Clavell book. Each player is head of a large business conglomerate and is striving to be the most influential and powerful leader in the Hong Kong business community. The route to power lies in the manipulations of the stock market, banks, and holding companies, and other typical corporate skull duggery.&#10;&#10;Synopsis of play:&#10;&#10;During a turn, players draw event cards, which can be used in many ways to affect one's own future, or the future of an opponent. Players then buy and sell stocks on a volatile stock market, which can fluctuate due to purchase and sale of stocks, failed contracts, or even loss of face (bad faith deals). Contracts are then announced, and if a player has sufficient assets, and can maintain those assets, lots of money can be made. Unfulfilled contracts go up for a general bid amongst the players. Players can then attempt to acquire loans from 3 Hong Kong banks, but, if the Bank Directors, or their proxies, so vote, a player can simply be denied a loan. Furthermore, bank directors, in the person of voting cards held by players, can call in outstanding loans, which must be immediately paid. Players now purchase various assets, such as airlines, railroads, shipping lines, industry, land, and human services, which the player must have to fulfill contractual obligations. Players can buy their own assets, or even lease them from other players. All possible wheeling and dealing is allowed, and no one is ever required to keep his or her end of a bargain. Lastly, if a player's stock falls far enough, and they have been unfortunate enough to lose enough of their own &quot;voting&quot; stock, they can be voted out of the game, which will end the game at the end of that phase. Otherwise, the game ends on the turn when the last event card is drawn.&#10;&#10;";1981;6.40217;2.7143;2;5;180;12;Economic, Negotiation, Novel-based

2736;The Lonely Mountain;"Lonely Mountain is an adventure game played by 1 to 6 players. Each player controls a group of adventurers attempting to sneak into the Lonely Mountain (Erebor) and steal as much loot as possible. However, they must escape before Smaug the Dragon awakens, discovers their trespasses, and slays them all. The game takes place relatively soon after Smaug attacked and drove out the Dwarves in Third Age 2770. At that time, Smaug had not yet sealed all of the minor entrances to Erebor, and he considered the entire inner complex of rooms and tunnels to be his &quot;lair&quot;. Thus adventurers can enter (and hopefully leave) in a variety of ways. A raid such as the one this game depicts could have been the event that caused Smaug to close all the minor entrances and to gather most of Erebor&acute;s loot into one huge pile.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a board representing the inner complex of rooms and tunnels where Smaug and most of the &quot;treasure&quot; of the Lonely Mountain reside. The board is highly abstracted and simplified to make play quick and easy.

2738;The Gnumies;"OVERVIEW:&#10;&#10;The Gnumies &amp; their friends from the planet Gnum love big Parties! They like to see Borsis, Dancemites, Boggelors or Divalettis as guests at their parties. But no one wants the dreaded Wullawakis at his party. The Gnummies &amp; their friends are shown on the Gnumies card, &amp; the guests on the party cards. There are 4 of each party card valued from 1 to 10, &amp; one of each party card valued from 11 to 15. The players try to win the most party cards, worth the most points, by playing their Gnumie cards. If a player has 2 or more party cards of the same value, their value multiplies, (2 of kind gets you 20 points, 3 of a kind 50 points and 4 of a kind 100 points). These of course can only be done with the cards that are valued from 1 to 10. A player who wins a Wullawaki, loses points. Having 1 Wullawaki will force you to lose the lowest valued party card that you have. Having 2 Wullawakis will force you to lose the highest valued party card in his party room. With 3 or more Wullawakis, the player will discard as many party cards as he has Wullawakis, (players choice in this case). Of course, the player with the most points at the end of the game is the WINNER!!!&#10;&#10;GAME PLAY:&#10;&#10;1) Any player turns over the top-most card in the party supply stack. &#10;2) Now each player selects a Gnumie card from his hand (Cards have a value from 10 to 100), and places it face-down in front of him (in his Party Room!). When all players have placed their bids face-down on the table, all players then reveal their bids. &#10;3) The player who played the highest valued bid in his party room wins the face-up party card. &#10;4) If 2 or more players tie with the highest bid, the player who has the the most Luckynits (small figures at the bottom of each Gnumie card), wins the party card. &#10;5) The player who wins the party card must discard the Gnumie card that he won with that bid. &#10;6) The other players take back their losing bid party cards. The round is now over and we repeat with Step 1 again.&#10;&#10;7) There is a little twist in the bidding when the Wullawaki card (bad card) comes out. The player with the highest Gnumie card still wins the Wullawaki card, but gets to take back his Gnumie card into his hand and the other players lose their Gnumie cards!&#10;&#10;8) The is also a &quot;WILD CARD&quot; in this game. It is called the &quot;COPICASTOR&quot;. It is a card used to make at least a pair of party cards. The Copicastor takes on the form of the lowest valued party card that the player has in his party room. This insures that a player will have at least a pair of cards and also make the low valued cards somewhat valuable to have, since some people may avoid making a high bid on a low value card. But, if you get this Copicastor it makes that low valued card at least worth 20 points (for a pair).&#10;&#10;9) The game ends when 1 player is left with his Gnumie cards. Since, he can't bid against anybody else, he takes the top most party cards as he has Gnumie cards in his hand.&#10;&#10;10) Scoring is based on attaining pairs, three-of-a-kind &amp; 4-of-a-kind of the numbered party cards that the players bid on (check the Overview paragraph above). If no pairs are attained, the value of that card is scored. So, if you have two 5-point cards, you score 20 Points for having a pair. But, if you have only one 5-point card you score 5 points!&#10;&#10;10) The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!!!&#10;&#10;Ages 8 and up&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Asterix: Das Kartenspiel&#10;&#10;&#10;";2001;5.34324;1.1667;2;5;20;8;Card Game, Fantasy

2742;Wings: World War One Plane to Plane Combat 1916-1918;"&quot;A game of plane to plane combat in World War I&quot;&#10;&#10;There is plenty of goodies in the box, including three geomorphic map boards, plenty of thick counters, and as much rules as you can stomach. Luckily, you can select both your level of realism (i.e. complexity: ranging from the Mass Game to the Duel Game) and the length of the scenario (30 min to 4 hours), so the game is pretty flexible in this regard.&#10;&#10;(what follows is abstracted from the ZOCO Historical Simulations Archive review)&#10;&#10;Wings is a simultaneous movement job and can get pretty complex. This is traditional heavy duty boardgaming, not as complex as Advanced Squad Leader but harder than Wooden Ships &amp; Iron Men and only workable with very few planes per player. Thankfully the rules do not all have to be used and Wings works pretty well with basic rules, with some of the advanced and optionals as required. The advanced rules are supposed to be used as a block but consist largely of tricky maneuvers as opposed to the turns and slides of the basic rules. A simpler fleet-style game using plenty of planes is also provided. The scenarios provided include the legendary Wings 6 hex Zeppelin counter, boat targets, bombing, trench-strafing and photo runs.&#10;&#10;The basic problem of WWI air combat as presented in Wings is that the planes are not very good, not very fast, grossly underpowered, turn poorly and chances are that when they get a shot off they tend to miss. As a result, there is a lot of manoeuvring (more than the columns provided on the plotting pad) and relatively little damage (it could have been jotted down separately instead of occupying part of the pad). 3-D is simulated through altitude levels (0 to the 800s --although many planes will not get that high); planes go faster when diving and lose speed when climbing. Go too slow and you will stall and spin downwards until you can pick up enough speed or crash.&#10;&#10;Simultaneous movement games often involve a lot of ESP because it is hard to tell where the opposition is going. Things are not so bad in Wings because planes have bank attitudes showing which way they lean, like in Blue Max. Turning, manoeuvring and climbing restrictions are such that you can narrow down the other plane's intent by carefully paying attention to its banking attitude. Likewise, firing arcs are restricted, and the penalties for firing in a turn and the like are pretty steep, so naturally a plane that thinks it has a good shot will keep pretty straight and level, not too hard to out-manoeuvre. The general problem of planes chasing each other over an endless sky and having limited powers of turning and climbing means they will not often be in each other's guns. Having missed, it will take some time for the planes to all move around back into suitable combat positions. The game is considerably improved by having more than 1 plane on each side, thus ameliorating the chance of someone being able to fire at someone else.&#10;&#10;Gunnery is based on 2D6 rolled as 11 to 66 (a frequent mechanism in Yaquinto games). Results will rarely destroy a target on 1 hit but affect some part of the plane. When not hitting Structure, your hits will likely reduce the limited performance of the planes. Some hits can reduce the power rating of planes. If the target only has 1&#10;power to spend each turn and it loses that, then it is in trouble --it can no longer climb or turn without losing speed and will be forced to dive to get anywhere. It is thus more sensible to fly off when suitably blooded rather than prolonging the game as planes slowly drag themselves back into combat.&#10;&#10;Solitaire gaming works quite well because the rules severely limit what a plane can do so the guessing is kept low. Play actually improves with more players as this generates more opportunities for mayhem. 50 plane types are provided although Yaquinto never published Wings II so other planes are referred to in the force tables that have no details (although it just may be possible to figure out those &quot;missing&quot; planes' characteristics from their counterparts in Blue Max and Knights of the Air). The planes are rated differently, but unfortunately performance varies with altitude so you need to check the plane reference card frequently --whilst the gun data is on the opposite side of the card.&#10;&#10;";1981;7.15211;3.2857;1;4;120;0;Aviation / Flight, Wargame, World War I

2748;Thirty Years War: Europe in Agony, 1618-1648;"(from GMT website:)&#10;&#10;Central Europe, 1618. Germany is a jigsaw puzzle of independent Electorates, Bishoprics, Dukedoms, and Imperial Free Cities nominally under the control of the Holy Roman Emperor in Vienna. An alliance of Protestant leaders rebel against the Emperor, who raises armies to suppress them and regain Catholic property lost during the Reformation; the surrounding kings of Spain, France, Sweden, and Denmark intervene to stake their own claims. Germany is plunged into thirty years of war that will last until 1648, when the exhausted combatants sign a peace establishing the competing spheres of interest that will control Germany for the next two centuries.&#10;&#10;&quot;Thirty Years War&quot; recreates this conflict with the award winning wargame system used in GMT's Wilderness War, Paths of Glory, and For the People. There are four scenarios provided: the Full Campaign (14 turns), Early War (5 turns), Intervention (3 turns), and Apocalypse (5 turns).&#10;&#10;This is a two-player wargame; one controls the Protestant forces (German Protestants, Sweden, Denmark, Hungary, France) while the other runs Catholics (the Empire, Bavaria, Spain, and occasionally Saxony, which can switch sides during play!). The heart of the game is the playing card decks of 55 cards that each player receives. Playing a card gives a player the option to move and attack with an army, to recruit new units, to bank up money to pay ever-hungry troops, or to declare an event.&#10;&#10;The Peace of Westphalia made certain that Germany would remain divided for another two centuries. Can the Catholic player defy history by recreating the power of the old Holy Roman Empire? Does Gustavus Adolphus survive to dictate peace to the Emperor in Vienna? Thirty Years War allows the players to determine these and other historical what-ifs, while opening a window onto one of the most influential events in European history.&#10;&#10;COUNTERS: 456 full-color die-cut counters.&#10;MAP: One 22&quot;x34&quot; full-color mapsheet&#10;CARDS: 110 Strategy cards&#10;OTHER: Two 10-sided dice, 32-page Rulebook, 2 Player Aid cards&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE: 2 years per turn&#10;MAP SCALE: Point-to-point system&#10;UNIT SCALE: 3-5,000 men each&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS: One or two&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: David Fox&#10;DEVELOPER: Michael Welker&#10;ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

MacGowan&#10;&#10;&#10;(BGG user description:)&#10;&#10;A direct descendant of Paths of Glory, 30 Years War covers the confusing post-Reformation conflict in central Europe, as the Holy Roman Empire attempts to reassert domination over the protestant states. On the side of Catholicism we have the Holy Roman Empire (Austria and some of Northern Italy at this point) and Spain, opposed by a cast of thousands: the German Protestants, Sweden at the height of her power, France, England, Denmark, and others.&#10;&#10;While there are some new mechanics, virtually the entire game is borrowed from elsewhere: Leader activations and movement are as in Hannibal, combat is straight out of Paths of Glory (minus the flanking), and Siege resolves much Hannibal. Your armies have to be paid, with Aid Points that are received just like Paths of Glory's RPs. An interesting twist is that the movement and support of armies results in the landscape getting Pillaged, so as the game goes on the board becomes less and less capable of supporting military operations.&#10;&#10;";2001;6.87804;3.1607;1;2;360;14;Pike and Shot, Wargame

2752;Combat Cards;"&quot;An abstract game of military strategy set in World War II&quot;&#10;&#10;This card game is played in partnerships by two, four or six people.  Each team represents the combined resources of a bloc of nations at war with the other team.  Points are accumulated by conducting offensives, opening new fronts and successfully countering enemy offensives.  The game ends once all the cards have been drawn and played.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you may shift a combat card between two of your fronts before drawing and playing or discarding a card.  Fronts are prepared face down, until the offensive is declared.  Fronts are laid out like in Caesar &amp; Cleopatra (or Hera &amp; Zeus --those kinds of games).  Cards come in two types, combat and &quot;special&quot;.  The combat cards represent units of infantry, armor, mine fields and so on.  Special cards include Strategic Bombing (which permanently reduces a player's hand size), New Front, Offensive/Supply (which launches or sustains an offensive, or can be used to shift Airborne combat cards between fronts).&#10;&#10;Points are scored mostly during offensives; every turn an offensive goes on, the difference between the attacker's total offense and the defender's total defense is scored by the stronger side.  There is also a bonus point score when opening a new front.&#10;&#10;The cards are very bland looking with a simple APP-6 or SPI-style symbol, a pair of offense/defense ratings and some explanatory text.  Most combat units lack character: Armour, Infantry and Combat Engineers work nearly the same way except for their different offense/defense ratings.  I'd have given the Combat Engineers a special power against Mine Fields, for example.&#10;&#10;";1984;4.0;1.0;2;6;90;12;Card Game, Wargame, World War II

You can perform 1 of 3 actions on a turn.  Play a card that is higher than the top card on the discard pile (which ends your turn), Play a pair of same suit cards whose sum is less than the top card (this does not end your turn and you must then take another action) or draw cards from stock. (You must keep drawing till you draw a male and female card. These cards are shown to the other players. This does end your turn.)&#10;&#10;Every time you play a pair you skip the next player in turn.

If the red die's result matches one of those on his or her card, the player then matches and places their white dice to the printed faces in the column below.  A player may also &quot;steal&quot; and use a white die that another player cannot use (because that player's red die column does not have that white die's face).  The next player in turn then picks up and rolls the red die and 3 white dice to do the same.  When a player has filled up an entire row, column or diagonal (the center space is considered already to be filled), he has scored a Combo (the amount of points received depends on whether it is a 4-die or 5-die row, column, or diagonal) and ends a round.

The declarer calls a trump (XIX) or one of the kings to indicate a partner (the partner does not indicate this fact though), after which players can make bonus announcements and doublings. During the play, suit must be followed and trump must be played if you are out of the suit.

Initial deal is four, Action cards in a separate stack.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you turn over an Action card and follow its instructions. You then match, build or discard one card from your hand. Cards Up turns all cards on the table face up, Black Out face down. Pass One means everyone passes a card to one's right. Lose One means you put a card down face up.&#10;&#10;Matching concerns the card values; you can collect cards of the same value as the played card, or pairs of cards that add up to that value. Building means you match as above but leave the matched cards as a pile, vulnerable to another player's matching. This is usually done so you can collect another card from your own hand (so you would &quot;Build eights&quot; with the table's 5+3 and your 8, hoping to &quot;Match eights&quot; on your next turn with your other 8). Discarding is what you do if you cannot Match or Build. This increases the table's pool of cards open for matching or building.&#10;&#10;After you've played your 4 cards in this way, another round ensues, and so forth until the entire deck has been gone through. Scoring is +10 for the most cards collected, +8 for the most Purple cards collected, +6 for the most Red cards collected, +4 for each &quot;BIG&quot; card collected, +2 for each 1 card, +2 for each Wild card.&#10;&#10;During a Black Out, you must memorize which card is which; if you declare a play but get the cards wrong, your played card is simply added to those already face down on the table.&#10;&#10;";1985;4.45238;1.3333;2;4;30;9;Card Game, Memory
2784;Plague!;"The Black Death was no Weekend Special. A lot of people became poorly, very poorly indeed. In fact, so poorly they had to be taken away because their Immortality was wearing rather thin.&#10;And... as Fate would have it they died right on time, left, right and center. The best place for these unfortunate victims was somewhere deep, dark and damp. Not too much unlike a pit (and people were dying to get there).&#10;&#10;Plague! Is a germ-free board game, we hope, for those of you who dare to transport wagon loads of infected victims to their final resting place, a deep pit at Clarks Hill. &#10; Object: Inspired by the yodel 'Bring out your Dead' the object of the game, for those who wish to play, is for each player to control a wagon which is used to visit the houses. Plague victims are 'claimed' and taken away to a burial site. All this whilst avoiding rats and fleas. The first to 'bury' 99 victims wins (remember, you're only doing your job). The winner must now go off and infect the rest of England.&#10;&#10;";1991;5.5341;1.2222;2;4;120;10;Animals, Medieval
2788;First to Reverse;"In this simple racing game, a racing car, a motorcycle, a bicycle and a roller skater are competing.  Each rolls varying number of dice, some of which are d3 instead of d6.  The race is even because each racer has a different turnaround point (the race is won by the first to get back to the starting point after reaching his turnaround point).  On average, all racers should finish neck-and-neck.&#10;&#10;";1988;4.75913;1.0;2;4;20;5;Children's Game, Racing

2792;Coco Crazy;"Six coconuts each contain six monkeys (&quot;bobbles&quot;) of identical colour.  Each player is trying to collect one bobble of each colour (five when playing with 7 or 8 players).  The game starts with the coconuts mixed on the board so that no one knows which one contains which colour.  Then each player peeks at one coconut.  On your turn, you roll a die.  Results possible include turning the board 90 degrees, guessing at a coconut's bobbles' colour (that's how you get bobbles) and having each player swap two coconuts as quickly as possible.&#10;&#10;A very merry game!&#10;&#10;Awards&#10;&#10;1992 &#195;&#133;rets Familiespil, Family Game of the Year Denmark&#10;&#10;";1992;5.4536;1.1304;2;8;20;7;Animals, Children's Game, Memory, Party Game
2794;Spinball;"Try to maneuver the ping-pong ball into your opponents goal by deftly applying just enough backspin and English to reflect off the sidewalls and around the barrier that separates you.  You have 5 attempts to get a goal, as long as the ball keeps returning to you.  But if you put too much speed on it, it'll fly off the other side as there's no backstop in this game, only side rails.  If you can manage to curl it all the way into your opponents 'end zone' and make it come back into the goal, you get two points.  But instead of taking a point, you can set up a blocker instead, to try to protect your goal.  Comes with each players yoke like ball holder and rubber shooting implement with a small wooden handle.  One of a kind designs from Charbanova Studio (home of Aaron Weissblum), each one is hand painted and unique.&#10;&#10;";2001;6.97223;1.1875;2;2;20;0;Action / Dexterity
2796;Quickely Dice;"Quik E Ly Dice is part dice game, part card collecting and melding game.&#10;A single set consists of 8 dice in 2 colours and 54 cards, 27 of in each of the same two colours as the dice.&#10;One set is suitable for two players, and there are three sets in all; Using all three with half the 162 cards allows up to six players.&#10;The cards depict two dice faces, one above the other. The object is to score points by collecting and then melding the cards, a la rummy.&#10;Players may meld numerical sequences of up to 11 cards, scoring 1 point for each card in the meld. These sequences must be along the top row dice face of the cards. Bonus points are scored for also forming certain combinations along the bottom row. For example, a sequence showing Red 1/4, 2/5, 3/6, 4/6 would score 16 points; 4 points for the 1,2,3,4 sequence along the top row, multiplied by 2 for all the cards being the same color, multiplied by 2 again for the 4,5,6 sequence along the bottom. There are several other bonuses which may be scored. &#10;The mechanics of the game are very simple. Several cards will be face up on the table at any one time. Each player may roll up to 3 of their 4 dice in an attempt to capture 1 or more of these cards.&#10;Cards are captured by rolling the two numbers corresponding to the two dice on a card. Thus, rolling a 1, 4, 5 will allow you to capture a 5/1, a 4/1 or a 5/4 card, provided they are available.&#10;If a player rolls just one of the numbers on a card that he/she wants, that player may &quot;reserve&quot; that card by placing the single dice on the card. If the player subsequently rolls the second number in a later turn, he/she can take the card. Reserved cards may still be captured by other players.&#10;";2001;4.0;2.0;2;6;60;0;Card Game, Dice
2798;The Ironclads: Expansion Kit;"The Expansion Kit extends the The Ironclads: A Tactical Level Game of Naval Combat in the American Civil War 1861-1865 system to 1879, adds ships from major European powers of the same time period, and features some optional rules (e.g., land and land-sea action, designated targets, double/triple gun loads, sharpshooters). New scenarios also, many of them set in the American Civil War, but some in South America or Europe.&#10;&#10;Originally issued by Yaquinto Games, a 2nd edition was released by Excalibre Games and this 2nd edition makes a number of corrections as well as features improved physical quality and graphics.&#10;&#10;The box-cover image shown above is the Yaquinto version.

2800;The Ironclads: A Tactical Level Game of Naval Combat in the American Civil War 1861-1865;"(from a Yaquinto ad:)&#10;&#10;The IRONCLADS is a tactical level, simultaneous movement, game of ship-to-ship combat in the American Civil War. Players move one or more of over 130 counters that represent individual ships over a large (42&quot; x 27-1/2&quot;) four pieceqeomorphlc mapboard as they attempt to outmaneuver and out-shoot their opponents. 45 ship specification cards give such vital information as the number, size, location and play of individual guns that are fired separately using specific range and penetration tables for each weapon. The ship specification card also contains target information for such areas as; armor, siding, decking, smoke stack, hull, pilot house, waterline, crew and gun hits. Other unit counters include five individual forts, floating batteries, mines, torpedos, booms, piles, heavy obstructions, fires, damaged ships, sunk ships, mortar rafts and much more.&#10;&#10;'The IRONCLADS comes boxed and complete with over 300 extra&shy; thick, die cut unit counters, the large mapboard, a well organized log pad, a set of charts and tables, range and play indicators for firing, two game dice, a plastic tray for unit separation and storage, 45 ship specification cards that represent 90 classes of ships and a rule book that covers such items as river currents, tides, forts, mines, armor penetra tion, crew quality and morale, smoke and sighting, sand bars, shoals and river banks, burning ships and fire fighting, different types of shot, cumulative damage in specific areas, critical hits and much, much more. Scenarios included in the game range from excellent &quot;running the forts&quot; situations for solitaire play, to famous ship-to-ship engage ments like the Monitor and the Merrimac, to blockade running, to multi-player campaign games like Mobile Bay.&#10;&#10;";1979;7.35939;3.5278;1;8;120;12;American Civil War, Civil War, Nautical, Post-Napoleonic, Wargame
2802;War in Europe;"War in Europe is a compendium of three modules, War in the East 2nd ed., War in the West, and War in Europe. The two base games, War in the East 2nd ed. and War in the West, are both playable individually and are both designed for two sided play. War in Europe provides an integrated linkage between these two and provides for three player play.&#10;&#10;The game system traces its lineage from SPI's earlier Kursk and Destruction of Army Group Centre but was primarily inspired by War in the  East 1st. ed.  War in Europe is played on nine full sized (22&quot;x34&quot;) coloured  maps and employs about 3600 1/2x1/2&quot; cardboard pieces.&#10;&#10;The three sides in the full game are the Italo-German Axis, the Anglo- French-American Allies, and the Soviet Union. Political rules govern the  alignment of neutral states and restrict the use of active minor power units  by the controlling players. Rules also restrict the degree of co-operation between units of differing nationalities, whether Axis or Allied. The victory  conditions are also constructed to limit the degree of co-operation between  independent Allied and Soviet players.&#10;&#10;Each 3/4&quot; hex represents 20 miles. A single game-turn consists of three sequential player turns and represents one week elapsed time. Four game- turns form a 'cycle' at the beginning of which strategic warfare and economic production takes place. Thirteen cycles form a game year. Both Axis and Soviet power produce additional forces via a simplified economic  production process. Allied forces are received only by a preset reinforcement schedule.&#10;&#10;Player pieces called units represent division and brigade sized military formations. In addition to units, all powers also possess air-point counters representing abstract air power at an estimated scale of 500 sorties per point. Markers are a third category of playing piece used to note some temporary alteration to the map or to a unit.&#10;&#10;Allied and Axis powers have amphibious point counters representing invasion lift assets. Each amphibious point is capable of lifting a single divisional sized unit and as acting as a 'beachhead' supply source. The Axis powers also have counters for Naval Transport points and Naval Surface Combat points. The Axis may build these points via his production routines.&#10;&#10;Naval points (of all types) risk interception and elimination (along with any transported unit) by air power when used to transport land units, enable  supply, or provide escort. Axis naval points also risk Allied naval interception and elimination when conducting transport operations on the high seas (anywhere other than the Baltic). The Allied player has a  standard number of naval transport points (15) that does not change from turn to turn and which cannot be destroyed when intercepted, though their cargo may be. Expended (not destroyed) amphibious points are automatically returned to play after a nine turn delay.&#10;&#10;The Soviet power possesses one transport point in the Baltic so long as Leningrad remains uncaptured and one naval transport point in the Black Sea so long as the Soviet retains at least one Black Sea port. If the Soviets ever lose their naval transport capability in either sea then it is lost for the rest of the game and cannot be restored.&#10;&#10;The Axis power possesses counters for sub points and markers for land fortifications (the Atlantic Wall). Both of these must be produced using the economic system employed during the strategic inter-phase conducted at the start of each cycle. Sub points are used to determine the rate of Allied reinforcement and are themselves subject to loss.&#10;&#10;The Allied power receives Strategic Bomber Points which are used to disable Axis Production and Transportation during the Strategic Inter- phase. These are subject to loss by German Strategic Air Defence air- points and Flak Points.&#10;&#10;A number of scenarios are provided covering the entire war or significant campaigns. Victory is determined by the Axis political point total and the possession of specified hexes. The Axis political point total is adjusted during the game based on Allied and Axis actions together with the control of specific hexes or the conquest/occupation/liberation of nations. A novel feature in the design is the use of varying CRTs by nation/year to account for the changing relationships in the combat power of units over the course of a six year war without recourse to replacement counters for the units.&#10;&#10;The original game was issued in SPI notorious 'flat-pack' plastic tray packaging that required three units to contain the product. Later (1978?) War in Europe was retailed in the large bookcase box format (the Soap- box). The game was ported to a MS-DOS computer program published by  Decision Games in 1996 and a revised reprint of the original boardgame was published by Decision Games in 1999. A New PC version of war in Europe will allow players to battle one another PBEM or face to face and is currently under development.&#10;&#10;The game contains: &#10;- 3600 counters&#10;&#10;        (Three identical Axis 400 counter contersheets)&#10;        (Three identical Russian 400 counter contersheets)&#10;        (Three identical Western Allied 400 counter contersheets)&#10;&#10;&#10;- Nine maps (A-H,J)&#10;- Four Rulebooks&#10;&#10;        (Standard Rules)&#10;        (War in the East 2nd Edition Exclusive Rules)&#10;        (War in the West Exclusive Rules)&#10;        (War in Europe Exclusive Rules)&#10;&#10;&#10;- Axis Production Spiral&#10;- Soviet Production Spiral&#10;- Axis Game-Turn Cycle Record Track&#10;- Soviet Game-Turn Cycle Record Track &#10;- Allied Game-Turn Cycle Record Track&#10;- Two Identical War in the East Comvbat Results Tables&#10;- Two Identical War in the West Comvbat Results Tables&#10;&#10;";1976;7.21583;3.9231;2;3;360;14;Economic, Political, Wargame, World War II
2804;200 Jahre Montgolfieren;"&quot;200 Years of Hot Air Balloons&quot; commemorates the bicentennial of the 1783 first balloon ascent by the Montgolfier brothers.&#10;&#10;The board is circular and divided into ten concentric rings. Twenty-four &quot;spokes&quot; combine with them to form a grid. Players each have a wooden balloon which shows its altitude by stacking it up, insecurely it seems, on small wooden disks. They also receive at start four ascent cards and four descent (gas bottle) cards. A wooden arrow on a disk at the center shows the current wind direction.&#10;&#10;Players move by rolling two dice, a special one which describes a change in wind direction or a requirement on the player and an ordinary one which gives the amount to move. There are actually three games in one, all centered around getting a balloon to a specific location, the first two based on real life balloonist games: a chase or &quot;fox hunt&quot; and a target race. The third scenario describes a race to the center of the board.&#10;&#10;";1983;5.91667;0.0;4;6;45;8;Aviation / Flight, Dice, Racing

They maneuver around each other, with the Destroyer player having limited knowledge of the depth and position of the U-Boat, each attempting to score a critical hit to win the game.&#10;&#10;The multi-ship game pits three U-Boats against three Destroyers.&#10;&#10;The first set of rules (1959) came in booklet form while the revised rules (1961) were on a large, folded single sheet. Differences in the rules included where torpedoes could be placed and the damage caused by near-miss depth charge attacks.&#10;&#10;Board: A grid of 19 x 14 square spaces&#10;Pieces: 3 U-Boats, 3 Destroyers&#10;&#10;";1959;5.85298;2.1818;2;6;30;12;Nautical, Wargame, World War II
2808;The Russian Campaign;"On the 18th of December, 1940 Hitler issued Fuhrer Directive No. 21, code named Barbarossa, which stated: &ldquo;The Soviet Union is to be crushed in one swift campaign before the war with England ends.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;On the 22nd of June, 1941, Barbarossa was finally launched. Over three million German soldiers, most of them veterans of the campaigns in Poland, France, and the Balkans, began a blitzkrieg style of invasion against two million Russian defenders. The initial advance was fantastic. Hundreds of thousands of prisoners were taken and the motorized divisions began to outrun the rest of the army. The Germans reached the gates of Moscow, victory in sight. Then the winter came.&#10;&#10;RUSSIAN CAMPAIGN has been universally acclaimed as one of the finest wargames around. With the ease and playability of the 'Classics', the game also conveys the feel of the actual campaign and is exceptionally accurate historically. Both players will have to use the subtle skills, advantages, and tactics of their historical counterparts to win.&#10;&#10;Game features include rail movement, sea movement, invasions, stukas, partisans, automatic victory, SS units, sudden death victory conditions, and double impulse movement capabilities.

2810;Checkpoint: Danger!;"This is a distant relative of Battleship.  Each player deploys four agents over a world map.  Then, using probes you try to deduce the position of the enemy agents before he deduces the positions of yours.  Basically, when you probe a grid location, the opponent announces how many of his agents can be reached in a straight line (including diagonals) from the probed location --excluding any of his agents which may be hidden behind others.&#10;&#10;Some extra complications occur because both are playing on the same map: for example, you may not probe where the opponent has probed, which opens up strategic opportunities...  &quot;Checkpoint: Danger!&quot; is what you call out when you're convinced one of his agents is in the same location as one of yours.&#10;&#10;";1978;6.33929;1.3333;2;2;30;10;Deduction, Spies / Secret Agents
2812;Platoon;"Platoon is a simple wargame on small squad combat in Vietnam.  The game is similar to AH's Smithsonian series games:  a single sheet with basic rules and a small booklet that contains advanced rules, additional scenarios and historical background information.  The combat system is also similar to other Smithsonian games.&#10;&#10;The scenarios and soldiers are based upon events and characters in the movie.&#10;&#10;The game uses two elements to create fog of war:&#10;-  the counters have small stands so the identity of each counter is unknown to the enemy.  Some of the counters are fakes and &quot;substitutes&quot; (these are used to combine several counters into a single group.  All counters are placed in an off board box and the matching substitute counter is placed on the map.)&#10;-  Random initiative draw.  Similar to Firepower, chits for each side are placed in a cup and each turn one is randomly drawn to determine which player may move.&#10;&#10;Platoon had a AH complexity rating of 3.&#10;&#10;";1986;5.91601;2.1081;2;2;120;15;Movies / TV / Radio theme, Vietnam War, Wargame
2814;Rapid Recall;"A player on one team gives clues to the rest of their team (possibly only 1 player) from a card that contains 10 words or phrases.  If the player knows what the clue is, they throw a chip in a bin on the game board.  Once the time is up, the 10 words have been clued, or the player elects to stop, they begin recalling the words that were clued from memory.  Upon getting the word correct (with one guess at each one only), a chip is taken out of the bin and put down on the guesser's side of the board.  If the clue is missed or if it is forgotten, the chip stays in the bin.  Once the guessing is completed or the time runs out, the other team gets a chance to steal the chips that remain in the bin.  If the remaining chips are not stolen, they go back to the guessing team.  The object is to fill up your side of the board with correctly guessed or stolen chips.&#10;&#10;";1993;6.17713;1.4;4;100;20;16;Memory, Party Game
2816;Crossfire;"This game is played on a large board like a soccer field, approx 100x80cm. The players each have a rotating plastic gun attached to their end of the board, behind a wire goal frame. The idea is to fire ball bearings from the gun to knock your puck into your opponents goal, and keep theirs  away from yours. The board is slightly curved to cause the balls to roll into pots at each end for re-use.&#10;&#10;A new version has been released by MB. The new version has more than one puck, and a smaller, rounded board. The original version came out in the 1970's and had a rectangular board and simple round pucks.&#10;&#10;This game is similar to Gunfight at OK Corral.&#10;&#10;";1971;5.38923;1.1136;2;2;10;7;Action / Dexterity, Real-time, Sports

2832;Great Western Railway Game;"The Great Western Railway (GWR) was one of the earliest railway companies, founded 1835, and built largely by the great British engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel. It ran from London to the West Country &amp; Wales, and was nicknamed God's Wonderful Railway. This game was produced as a 150th anniversary edition by Gibson Games (and re-issued later) and has a jigsaw board showing the rail network and a deck of 80 cards in coloured sets. Players move their tokens around the main lines and branch lines, collecting, swapping and forfeiting cards to get sets. Movement is determined only by the lines and junctions. The rules say the game was inspired by a railwayman Richard Morris, but the board shows copyright Sara Finch &amp; Leslie Scott.&#10;&#10;5,000 copies were made, each with a serial number on the rulebook. A subsequent print run was not numbered and had a few minor changes to the rules.&#10;&#10;";1985;5.05897;1.0;2;6;90;8;Trains
2836;Dragonlance Mage Stones;"Very vaguely themed to the AD&amp;D Dragonlance campaign background. The board is a grid 7 x 9, with columns numbered 3-9, columns representing planes of reality, rows representing schools of magic, though this has no effect on gameplay. The board &quot;wraps&quot; top to bottom, but not for the purposes of diagonal capture.&#10;&#10;Players roll 3d3 (six sided dice numbered 1-3 twice), and place their coloured tokens on a space in the column matching the dice total. The exception to this is where the three dice are all different, where the player misses a turn &quot;distracted by events in the prime material plane.&quot; When a player rolls all three dice the same, they get another turn after placing their stone.&#10;&#10;Capture of opposition stones is in the style of Othello/Reversi, but captured stones are removed from the board and returned to their owner. First player to place all their stones wins.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Let's Do Lunch! &#10;&#10;&#10;";1990;5.96504;1.4545;2;6;10;10;Abstract Strategy, Dice, Fantasy

2840;Heuchel und Meuchel;"Heuchel und Meuchel has a medieval look to the board and tiles, as players try to move characters of different social class up the courtly ladder to their goals. The tiles are of six characters; The Fire-Eater, The Minstrel, The Quack, The Bishop, The Lady &amp; The Prince, each tile having a distinctive background pattern. There are 6 tiles of each, numbered from 1 to 6. The board is a simple grid of columns, having starting and finishing squares with patterns matching the tiles. Players draw 6 tiles each and place them on their starting squares, stacking them if necessary. Then they move a tile, or a stack or an upper part of a stack, up their column to the next free space.&#10;&#10;When you place a tile, if there is another player's tile on the same row with the same value, it is taken under protection of yours, by placing it under yours to make a stack. You then have another move. So if the 4 Minstrel ends on the same row as the 4 Lady, she is taken under his wing. This can be done in the finishing area too and if this reveals a tile beyond its station, that is removed as a penalty to its owner. When a tile reaches its matching finishing square, it is turned over and is done with. When only one player can move, the game ends and you score. For each tile that reached its place or beyond, you score its value, deducting any penalties. Most points wins. There is a variant using a die to control your moves.&#10;&#10;An odd movement game, with some thought and memory needed for the knock-on effect, but not a great game. Nice to look at though.&#10;&#10;";1990;5.15341;1.5;3;6;30;12;Medieval
2842;TransAmerica;"TransAmerica is a simple railway game. Each player has a set of five cities strung across the U.S. that need to be connected by rail. Players first place their station on an intersection on the map, then take turns placing one or two rails each turn on the lines of the map. Initially they can place only adjacent to their station or on a line that touches their station, but once their network connects with another player's, they can place anywhere along the combined network.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the first player completes a connected route between their five cities. The player who can make the best use of the other players' networks is generally victorious.&#10;&#10;";2001;6.6879;1.3467;2;6;30;13;Trains
2844;Throneworld;"Players expand from their home world to explore systems, starting at the edges of a board and working inward towards the center Throneworld.  The systems get progressively tougher as players move inward which often involves battling units of greater size and/or technology level.  The interesting mechanics allows players to choose 11 different unit types (6 space and 5 ground) to organize into fleets, explore and conquer worlds.  In addition, there are four types of technology: Space Combat, Ground Combat, Jump (controls how far a fleet may move), and Communications (controls the distance you can control fleets).  Players compete to be the first to control a certain number of systems for a full turn.  Controlling the Throneworld counts as six (6) systems.&#10;&#10;";1997;6.62051;3.5238;2;6;270;0;Science Fiction, Space Exploration, Territory Building, Wargame
2846;Supremacy: The Unconventional Forces;"The Unconventional Forces expansion focuses on Assassins, Spies, Saboteurs, Biowar, Chemwar, and Envirowar. There are three new decks, Assassins and Spies, Saboteurs, and Special Weapons. There are 15 Assassin cards and 25 Spy cards in one deck. The Assassins are used to kill an officer in a specific territory or sea. The spy can identify a player's amount of money on hand, location of resource cards, type and tech level of any advances, and names and locations of officers. The saboteur does exactly what you'd expect. The Special Weapons cost $500 Million to research and develop.

You secretly research and develop high-tech edge on opponents before battle begins. You can also sell the new technologies to your allies. The high-tech advances reduce movement costs, leaving more resources for selling, building, or fighting.&#10;The expansion contains a deck of 40 Army cards and 40 Navy cards.

2854;Exploration;"Exploration was a very popular 1970s game from Britain's best game company, Waddingtons. The dramatic &amp; colourful box cover, showing the Kon Tiki raft, mountain climbers, ziggurats, and scuba divers on a wreck, inspired thousands of British kids to explore the globe, at least in their fantasies. To win, you must mount an exploration to one of four Objectives (Lost City, Summit, Island and Sunken Galleon), return to base and make the most money. Being first back was not enough, you've got to make the best profit on your trip.&#10;The game is played in 2 phases; initially you move round the outer track on die rolls, collecting Personnel cards, buying Equipment cards and drawing Exploration Club cards (which may gain or cost you cash to the Prize Fund). When your group is assembled, take the appropriate dobber (Yacht, Lorry, Tent or Ship) and set off.&#10;The 2nd phase has you moving over land or sea using the unique Diradice, a d6 with a 5 symbols. These allow you to move 1 or 2 spaces orthogonally or diagonally. The problem is that the spaces on the board are littered with symbols which you can only cross if you have the correct equipment, like the compass, dinghy or mountain boots. You must have an explorer with the Main Objective to reach your goal, but the other personnel allow you to avoid hazards and reach Lesser Objectives (Skeleton, Pearls, Rare Flower etc.) to gain cash. 1st, 2nd and 3rd home get cash and 1st back gets the Prize Fund.&#10;A pretty simple game of dice rolling, the only real choice is when to launch your trip. But the theme, the striking board and cards and that weird die makes this a fondly remembered game in the UK.&#10;&#10;";1967;5.62473;1.4;2;5;45;8;Economic, Exploration, Nautical
2856;BrewMaster: The Craft Beer Game;"From the publisher/designer:&#10;&#10;Players combine ingredient cards to produce six beer styles including ale, stout and Belgian. In doing so players use some of the 90 cards representing real beer ingredients.&#10; After producing beer players place chips (representing crowds) onto the laminated game board (so that it can be played on a bar table). As the game continues players try to make better beer and steal crowds from each other.&#10;&#10;The game is heavily influenced by event cards, which are drawn after players brew beer. The event deck represents some of the real triumphs/tragedies that have taken place in the craft beer world, such as the brewer who loses his green scrubie in the heat exchanger and loses a turn. The event deck also contains beer festivals and the dreaded Big Breweries card.&#10;&#10;The player with the most beer festival trophies and crowd markers wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game is good for game fans as well as experienced and novice beer lovers and their friends.&#10;&#10;";2001;5.59819;1.6154;2;5;60;16;Card Game, Economic, Party Game

Anyone can make one, even for profit, without paying any sort of royalties of any kind.  It is generally requested that they conform to some standard dimensions, but otherwise, they are free to make and sell.&#10;&#10;The suggested Piecepack dimensions make them compatible with Looney Pyramids.&#10;&#10;";2001;6.97413;2.3636;0;0;10;5;Book, Game System

2864;Automania: The Game of the Motor Giants;"Automania, The Game Of The Motor Giants, was Ian Livingstone's second self-produced game, after Boomtown, in a limited edition of 1000. The board is a simple scoring track and large flags for each country. Players have nice wooden car shaped pieces in six colors and a larger car to score with. There is a numbered deck of 56 Market Cards in English and German which affect the game each round. Players use a Record Sheet and the rules are in English and German.&#10;&#10;Players represent national car manufacturers trying to export cars to six other countries. Combining the placing some export cars in the markets on the board and secretly noting the remaining export cars on your Record Sheet, players also assign advertising budgets to the markets. Each market has a export limit that it can accept and the cars go for a fixed price in each market, so whoever spends more money on advertising gets to sell their cars first. But before revealing the spending, players play one of their Market Cards, which affect the Market in various ways (e.g. 36 - Car of the Year, Sweden will sell all its cars in the USA). After the market is reorganized, players then determine what cars are actually sold and how much Sales Revenue they have earned. Then subtract costs from sales to give profit. For each $10,000 profit you earn, you move your scoring marker one space on the scoring track. First round the track wins.&#10;&#10;Reportedly a fun game, it drew some criticism in Sumo for the imbalance caused by the Market Cards. The designer replied and suggested which cards might stand removing (7 to 17, 26, 27 and 35). Ian's reply is on the Game Cabinet and makes interesting reading today.&#10;&#10;";1991;5.98235;1.8571;4;6;60;13;Economic, Industry / Manufacturing
2865;Kersplatt!;"Kersplatt! is a food fight card game. Players at a dinner party throw food at each other over the table and try to dodge what is thrown at them in a vain effort to stay clean. Players are dealt 5 cards each and the rest are laid face down to form the table. The cards are FOOD to be thrown (having a Splat Factor and Dodge Factor), DODGE to dodge food (having a Dodge Factor), EVENT cards (e.g. Catch, Grab, Oops, Butler etc.) to allow actions, and OBJECT cards (e.g. the host's furniture, paintings etc.). You play cards onto each other and draw from the table until the cards run out. If you dodge food, it might hit an object and the host will hassle the thrower (who misses goes). When players can no longer play cards, whoever has the least food on them is &quot;allowed to think they have won&quot;.&#10;The production is fairly simple, the graphics are basic (b &amp; w), and the rules are chatty and a bit unclear.

You move from station to station on the roll of the die, but to change lines you must stop at junctions and draw a Hazard card. This may move you or other players around the board.

It features a large three-fold board of a fine painted lake, sets of large cards with excellent artwork and unbelievably, 6 different solid pewter figures of fishers and two little pewter rowboats. There is even a Record Book to keep a diary of your days by the lake.&#10;And days it will be, because, despite the wonderful attention to detail and genuine care taken in its making, this is a deadly dull game of dice rolling and dice rolling and dice rolling. You first seed the board with little paper tiles showing fish on one side &amp; their weight hidden below. Then you have to roll dice to walk round the lake to your chosen fishing spot (why???), roll dice to use the rowboat, roll dice to hook a fish, roll dice to reel it in, roll dice as the fish runs and so on. The cards are used as part of landing the fish, being Run, Hazard &amp; Problem cards. So it may run straight to you, but if it slips into the reeds, you lose your catch.&#10;No doubt habitual fishers will enjoy the tedium and it may well be a fine simulation of the sport, but any gamers will go mad.&#10;&#10;Absolutely typical for a British product, a classic case of theme before game, no idea of a mechanism beyond dice and hazard cards. The graphic artist is named, but the actual designer is not. I suspect it is the eponymous Anglepen.

On your turn, you buy into one firm or another by placing chips onto the board. Later you may sell your investment, making a profit or loss as the prices fluctuate. You draw a Fact Card, which gives info about the price of gold, the currency exchange rates, the FTSE index (the UK's Dow Jones) for a certain week. Based on that info, you decide if your shares will be up or down and whether to sell or hold. If you sell, the Banker checks the actual price in the Market booklet and debits or credits you accordingly. Rolling a VC on the die draws a Venture Card, with the usual hazards and gains to your cash.&#10;More of a crude stock market simulation than a game of strategy, the makers proposed selling fresh decks of Fact Cards and Market booklet for successive years.&#10;&#10;";1986;4.0;1.0;2;6;120;0;Economic

Players also have 4 markers to block the board to other players. Players are dealt 5 stamps to start and may swap one with the stamp dealer (banker). Then you roll 2 dice and choose which instruction on the board to follow. So if you roll a 2 and 4, you can use the instruction at 2/4 or at 4/2 on the grid.

2901;GolfMania;"It's just like playing golf -- only faster, funnier, and uses cards and dice instead of balls and clubs. Bad pants, while recommended, are not required. &#10;Okay!  it's nothing like playing golf. But it's still a lot of fun!&#10;&#10;Golfmania is a wacky, fast-paced card game for 2 to 6 players. The object of the game is to complete 18 holes of golf through equal parts luck, strategy, and the sincere desire to see your opponents suffer. It's a game the whole family can enjoy: the rule are simple, the cards are fun and colorful, and you can play it in under 20 minutes.&#10;&#10;Here's a quick overview of what the game is like: At the beginning of each turn, a &quot;Hole&quot; card is drawn. Each Hole card is worth a certain number of hole points if you win it, so you take a swing (i.e., roll the die) and give it your best shot. Everyone   gets a chance to swing, and everyone gets to play cards which affect that swing -- freaky weather, lucky gophers, hi-tech golf equipment and other zany events are sure to change the way you play golf.&#10;&#10;Did you win the Hole? Great! You're a few points closer to your winning goal of 18 hole points. If not -- no matter, you'll just have try again on the next Hole card... and get revenge on the opponent who nailed you with that nasty card last turn.&#10;&#10;";1997;5.13864;1.24;2;6;20;12;Action / Dexterity, Card Game, Party Game, Real-time, Sports
2902;Twilight Imperium: Armada;"(Not to be confused with the Twilight Imperium: Twilight Armada accessory)&#10;&#10;The galaxy is engulfed in terrible conflict. Fleets of havoc are patrolling ancient borders in space and impressive armadas, bent on destruction, are penetrating deep into enemy systems. It is a time of skill and cunning, a time of tactics and planning, it is a time of war. Armada is set in the rich and popular Twilight Imperium universe where players take control of one of the four major races of the crumbled empire, and must battle for glory and survival. Filled to the brim with ships of war, personnel, and technologies, Armada is a customizable game of strategic resource allocation and tactical space warfare.&#10;&#10;Take control of the unique capabilities of each race's fleet:&#10;&#10;Federation of Sol&#10;Sardakk N'orr&#10;Barony of Letnev&#10;Emirates of Hacan&#10;&#10;Each ship is a die-cut counter that you move by &quot;flipping&quot; (Diskwars or Range Wars players will be familiar with this system). Each ship has their stats clearly printed on the tile so there are no sheets to cross reference. Combat is resolved by tossing Hit Counters to see how much damage you do. If the damage penetrates the opponent's shields, they must check for Critical Hits. This is an exciting alternative to dice rolling.&#10;&#10;Overall a very fun and simple space combat game, not to mention an inexpensive alternative to miniatures.&#10;&#10;Another note of interest, when the Star Trek Red Alert! game went out of print Fantasy Flight Games continued the game in their Twilight Imperium universe. The two games are compatible but the big difference is that Armada doesn't have cloaking technology but does have Squadrons. Squadrons are comprised of Fighters or Bombers and both are extremely nasty. If you play against an opponent with a Carrier, you're a sitting duck unless you include some fighters of your own.&#10;&#10;The Twilight Imperium: Armada &#226;&#128;&#147; Stellar Matter pack is the ultimate terrain expansion, with all the asteroids, mine fields, planets, space docks, and planetary defense systems you'll ever need.

2903;The Hunt for Red October;"The Hunt for Red October depicts &quot;modern&quot; naval combat in the North Atlantic, Soviets vs. Nato.&#10;&#10;The game contains 8 scenarios that place various combinations of aircraft, surface ships, and submarines at the players' disposal. The map is broken up into irregular &quot;spaces&quot; containing land, shallow or deep sea. Land spaces may contain airbases and/or ports; sea spaces may contain standing detection patrols (SOSUS, etc).&#10;&#10;Pieces are double sided cardboard of 3 different sizes (capital ships/task forces, small ships/submarines, and aircraft) with the back only giving the basic information (a formation of aircraft, a submarine silhouette or a Task Force symbol) to keep the specific information of the unit secret from the opponent. Each unit has a detection rating and an attack rating.&#10;&#10;Each side starts each turn with a random number of detection attempts (2+d10 for NATO, 2+d6 for Soviet). Pieces are moved on the board (ships/subs up to 3 spaces, aircraft up to 1, 4, or 8 depending on type). As opposing pieces are moved into the same spaces, detection attempts are spent trying to locate the enemy units in the space (usually d10 &lt;= detection rating). Detected units are turned sideways so both sides can see it. Once units are found combat may be initiated.&#10;&#10;Combat is done in two attack phases. Dice are rolled vs. the attack rating of the attacking unit(s) (usually 1 d10 but there are exceptions) and hits are determined and resolved simultaneously. Ships that did not fire in the first phase conduct a second attack phase. Units can be in combat if not detected but upon firing become detected (which means undetected units almost invariably shoot in the second phase). Hits are again determined. 1, 2 or 3 hits (subs, small surface ships, large surface ships) are required to destroy a unit. Aircraft are destroyed only if the hit on them was a rolled 1 or 2. Victory is determined by scenario conditions. There are several optional rules, none of which appear to significantly increase the complexity of the game.&#10;&#10;";1988;6.00606;2.4717;2;2;60;12;Modern Warfare, Nautical, Novel-based, Wargame
2904;John Prados' Third Reich;"(from Avalanche Press website:)&#10;&#10;Third Reich interweaves not only the land, naval and air struggles, but also the equally important economic and political battles. Players must guide their nation to victory by capturing key objectives while making sure no one else &mdash; in particular their allies &mdash; gets there first.&#10;&#10;Players take on the leadership of Britain, France, Italy, Germany, the United States or the Soviet Union. Each of these major powers, in turn, can influence smaller countires like Turkey, Greece or Romania to join the war on their side. They can offer bribes or territory, and sometimes it&rsquo;s more important to decrease someone else&rsquo;s influence than to build up your own.&#10;&#10;The currency of the game is the Basic Resource Point, or BRP. This represents the financial, industrial and agricultural production needed to wage war. BRP&rsquo;s are used to build new units, to pay for offensives, to replace losses suffered in battle, to bribe minor countries, and for a host of other purposes. Each country&rsquo;s production can be affected by conquering or losing territory, or through strategic warfare (chiefly, attacks by submarines and bombers).&#10;&#10;Once activated (usually at a cost in BRP&rsquo;s), land, naval and air units can move and attack enemy units. Combat is resolved by rolling dice, with a result of 6 usually equalling a hit. There are no Combat Results Tables; every factor counts and there are no &ldquo;perfect numbers&rdquo; of units to commit to battle as in some wargames. When a land unit is hit, BRP&rsquo;s can be used to absorb some of the damage, but too many hits and it is reduced in strength or destroyed. Naval and air units pack a greater punch, but don&rsquo;t bounce back from damage as easily.&#10;&#10;Scenarios, or game situations, begin the game in 1938, 1939, 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944 or 1945. Political markers are randomly chosen to determine what events might take place outside the players&rsquo; control: Poland might capitulate to Germany in 1939, Mussolini, Churchill or Hitler might unleash some stupid scheme the Italian, British or German player will have to execute, oil could be found in Libya, the French navy could rally to the Allies or the Axis, jets can be developed, good Germans might kill Hitler &mdash; dozens of such events are possible.&#10;&#10;&#10;As one of the most popular games of all time, our edition of Third Reich has also spawned a sequel, Great Pacific War. The two games can be played together or separately.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;(BGG description:)Avalanche Press' re-release of the original classic. This is a significant overhaul based on the Avalon Hill Third Reich, and has nothing to do with the later Advanced Third Reich.&#10;&#10;There has been dramatic simplification and streamlining, however. Gone is the CRT, replaced by a Columbia-esque &quot;roll lots of dice&quot; combat resolution system. The whole front/option system has been revised with an &quot;HQ activation marker&quot; system: each nation buys activation markers for HQs, land, and air units, and puts them in a cup. Turn order is then determined by draws. Naval and air systems have been overhauled and simplified: sea zones now regulate movement. Tactical air support is now limited to being equal to the strength of the attacker/defender, not three times.&#10;&#10;Also includes 1938 (Spanish Civil War boils over to a general European conflict) and 1945 scenarios (Western Allies and Russia fall out after collapse of Germany).&#10;&#10;";2001;6.50482;4.0;2;5;360;12;Economic, Wargame, World War II

Movement is handled through rounds of card play during which cards are played and then reacted to in order to eliminate all the cards in your hand.  Dinosaur cards have values ranging from 1-5 while Escape cards have values ranging from +1 to +3.  In order to play a Dinosaur atop another Dinosaur, it must be greater in value than the preceding card.  Escape cards may be played on any Dinosaur and these also allow you to play an additional Dinosaur card.&#10;&#10;Once someone has gone out, movement on the board (of players and the Spinosaurus) is based upon the last played card.&#10;&#10;If the Spinosaurus lands on your pawn, you are knocked back (not eliminated).&#10;&#10;First pawn/player to reach the Final Escape space wins.&#10;&#10;";2001;4.51515;1.0;2;4;30;8;Animals, Card Game, Children's Game, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Science Fiction

2912;Hounds and Jackals: Game of the Pharaohs;"The Ancient Egyptian game known to us as &quot;Hounds &amp; Jackals&quot; or &quot;58 holes&quot; appeared fairly late in Egyptian history, during the New Kingdom. Neither name nor game rules have come down to us, so how the game was played is up for debate an reconstructions. One assumption is that it has similarities to Snakes &amp; Ladders.&#10;&#10;In a reconstructed set of rules, each player races his team of pieces (hound- and jackal-headed sticks, respectively) on his side of the race track, which includes a couple of ladder/snake shortcuts. Since each player races on a separate track, there is apparently no direct player interaction.&#10;&#10;";-2000;4.63333;1.0;2;2;20;6;Ancient, Dice
2913;Supremacy: Neutron Bombs and Killer Satellites;"Neutron bombs and killer satellites are new weapons, which will give you more tactical and strategical options during a battle. &#10;Fire neutron bombs at a territory, destroy your opponent's armies, then occupy that territory with your own armies and take the resources. Killer satellites are able to attack L-stars and other killer satellites. They may also shoot down nukes. &#10;Missile silos are used to fire nukes and neutron bombs. Spaceports are used to launch L-stars and killer satellites.&#10;&#10;Playing Equipment&#10;&#10;Colored disks (6 x 39) are color-matched to each superpower. Use them to record the number of neutron bombs and killer satellites in your supply center. They are also used to represent the missile silos and spaceports when placed on the game board. &#10;Each colored disk represents one missile silo. Two disks, placed on top of each other, represent spaceports.&#10;&#10;Colored mushroom clouds (6 x 18) are color-matched to each superpower.

2918;The Last Crusade;"A quick yet realistic game of World War II combat that recreates the Allied campaign from the hedgerows of Normandy to the crossing of the Rhine and the capture of Germany's industrial heartland. As the commander of an army regiment, U.S. or German, you'll control platoon-sized elements of infantry, armor, artillery, air and support units, each represented by a playing card. Your goal: decisive victory with the overrun of the enemy's HQ (easiest to obtain if you command the well-provisioned invading Americans), or at the very least the crippling halt of your opponent's offensive (sometimes the only route to victory for the heavily-armed but somewhat beleaguered Germans). Either way, only shrewd tactics, careful use of resources, and the sheer guts of the battle-hardened separate the victorious from the defeated.&#10;&#10;Sold as starter decks (2 are the minimum for the game) and Booster Packs, this collectible card game evokes the feel of simple miniatures play.&#10;&#10;Starters and Boosters favor Rares well so collecting is easy.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.64953;2.625;2;2;120;10;Card Game, Collectible Components, Wargame, World War II
2919;Search for the Emperor's Treasure;"Originally published in issue #51 (July 1981) of Dragon Magazine.&#10;&#10;A tongue-in-cheek version of &quot;classic&quot; Dungeons &amp; Dragons (some even say Mertwig's Maze is a similar treatment of Advanced D&amp;D).  As such, players become a warrior, elf, cleric, or magician, then wander around the board collecting treasure and resolving encounters.  The Emperor's six magic artifacts are both high-powered magic items and a countdown clock, as when enough have been found, the game ends. (Exactly how many depends on number of players.)&#10;&#10;Treasure, encounters and equipment are all randomized with chits in three cups. Characters obtain them by fighting monsters or lucky die rolls on result charts associated with various board locations (e.g., castles, villages, The Wizard's Tower, The Pirate Lair, etc.).  Not all encounters are monsters -- some are travelers who will bestow treasure upon completion of quests, others are annoyances, and there's even Imperial Guard patrols looking to confiscate the Emperor's Treasure.&#10;&#10;Terrain types are a key strategy feature, as a player whose current location's terrain doesn't match the encounter drawn can bestow it on someone else who does.  So a character in rugged forest or mountains can get stuck fighting several monsters in succession during other players' turns.&#10;&#10;A surprising amount of flavor is included for a magazine game.  There's an assortment of magic spells, ranged and close combat, magical weapons &amp; armor, damsels in distress, evil wizards, a volcanic demon, even a wandering elephant.&#10;&#10;A significantly revised version was published as part of The Best of Dragon Magazine Games.&#10;&#10;";1981;6.97137;1.7619;2;10;60;10;Adventure, Economic, Exploration, Fantasy, Fighting

2921;The Game of Life;"This game attempts to mirror life events many people go through from going to college, raising a family, buying a home, working and retiring.&#10;&#10;The intent of the game is to have the most assets at the end of the game, assets are earned primarily by working and earning tokens with dollar amounts on them.  Additionally the first person to complete the course gets additional money tokens.&#10;&#10;There is a very linear board that you move along by spinning a wheel or landing on spaces that tell you to move to a specific space or forward or back.  There are a handful of intersections where you can choose to go one direction or another but they ultimately have similar spaces and meet back up quickly.  There are a handful of choices regarding insurance and investments but for the most part it is a game of luck.&#10;&#10;Note -- this entry covers many versions of the game with different rule sets.  In general, the newer the printing the gentler the rules.  The 1960s original can be quite brutal if the players choose to act on all the options made available to them.

2932;Hnefatafl;"Hnefatafl, also known as The Viking Game, The King's Table or simply Tafl, is one of those two-player games where the opposing sides are not equal in number. The defending side comprises twelve soldiers and a king, who start the game in a cross formation in the center of the board. Their objective is for the king to escape by reaching any of the four corner squares. The attackers comprise 24 soldiers positioned in four groups of 6 around the perimeter of the board. All pieces move like the Rook in chess and pieces are taken by &quot;sandwiching&quot; i.e. moving your piece so that an opponent's piece is trapped horizontally or vertically between two of yours. There is a host of information on the Internet about Hnefatafl, including many rule variations that are worth experimenting with.&#10;&#10;A copy of the game was published in issue #128 of Dragon magazine, Dec 1987 (later republished as part of a boxed set: The Best of Dragon Magazine Games in 1990).&#10;&#10;One of the oldest games in the world - traced in various versions to the Vikings, Welsh, Saxons, and Irish.

2936;Dice Run;"Dice don't have legs, but in Dice Run they'll scamper as quickly as they can to get ahead of their fellow cubic cross-country runners. If you play your cards right, you'll be backing the winners and score thanks to their efforts.&#10;&#10;Dice Run includes thirty dice, with six dice in each of five different colors. To start the game, you roll these dice on the table to form the starting pack of runners. Each player has a hand of three movement cards and four secret target cards; these latter cards show a die with a particular number and color.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player plays a movement card and carries out its effect. If he chooses a red movement card, for example, all of the red dice &quot;break out&quot; of the pack and move ahead to form the leading group of runners. If the next player plays a 5 movement card, she first moves ahead all of the 5s from the leading group &ndash; thereby forming a new leading group &ndash; then she moves all the 5s from the next group in line ahead one group. Movement cards also allow players to switch the position of two non-leading groups, to drop a die from the leading group to the back of the pack, to flip all the dice in a group that match a particular number, to have three dice break out from the leading group, and so on. Alternatively, a player can place a movement card face down on the table, then roll all the dice in a non-leading group; he can't take this option again until another player makes such a roll. After playing a card, he refills his hand to three movement cards.&#10;&#10;A player can also choose to use one of his secret target cards to move the dice, first moving all the dice of the matching number, then all dice of the matching color, or vice versa. This card remains on the table.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, the movement deck is seeded with four stage cards valued 3-6. When a stage card is revealed, players each simultaneously reveal one of their secret target cards. (If a player used a target card for movement, he must choose this card.) For each die in the leading group that matches the color of this card, the player scores 1 point; he also scores 1 point for each matching number. If a die is identical to his target card, he scores 1 bonus point as well. Whoever has the highest score claims the stage card, which is worth 3-6 stage points. The players with the second- and third-highest scores receive 2 and 1 stage point.&#10;&#10;After four stages, the player with the most stage points wins!&#10;&#10;";2002;5.90278;1.413;2;6;30;10;Dice, Racing
2938;Zatre;"Zatre is short for Zahlen &amp; Treppen, numbers and steps. The publisher was obliged to replace the phrase &quot;scrabbling with numbers&quot; for &quot;dominoes for the 21st century&quot; on the box, but really it is just Scrabble with numbers. And very good for it, it is too. There are 121 tiles with 1-6 dots like a standard die or domino (20 of each number plus an extra 1). Players alternately draw and place 2 tiles on the board extending the pattern already laid. When you make a vertical or horizontal line that totals 10, 11 or 12 (12 is the limit), you score 1, 2 or 4 points accordingly on your game pad. Completing scoring lines on the pad gives a rising bonus and covering marked squares on the board gives you a doubling bonuses on your pad.&#10;&#10;Simple and quick, but surprisingly challenging when you get the idea. The idea being that you must keep an even, balanced score pad, scoring 10s and 11s, not just successive 12s. Easy to pick up, but it requires some effort to score well; spotting those opportunities to place one tile which scores each way, making sure you keep clocking up 10s, to turn into 11s or 12s. Luck does play a role, but good players consistently score highly game after game, so there must be something deeper at work.&#10;The publisher Perner maintains a website with play &amp; chat over the internet and there are several very active Zatre clubs in Germany, Austria &amp; Switzerland. Players results are scored on the ranking table on the website.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by: Zatre: Das Kartenspiel&#10;&#10;";1990;6.34835;2.0417;2;6;45;8;Abstract Strategy

2944;Halli Galli;"Halli Galli is a speed action game in which players watch for sets of exactly five fruit. The deck contains 56 playing cards showing four kinds of fruit in groups of 1 to 5 and a bell of the type found at hotel reception desks.&#10;&#10;The deck is distributed evenly between the players. All players hold their deck face down and take turns dealing one card face up in front of them. As each player reveals her next card, the instant you see a total of five of one kind of fruit on the table, hit the bell. If you're correct, you pick up all the played cards and put them into your deck; if you're wrong, you pay the other players one card each. When you run out of cards, you're out. When two players are left, they play until the bell is struck once more, then the game ends and the taller deck wins.&#10;&#10;Keep in mind that a five-of-a-kind can occur both when cards are revealed and when they're covered. If, for example, cards showing 3, 1 and 4 bananas are on the table and the 3 is then covered by a non-banana card, suddenly five bananas are showing and somebody better be reaching for the bell.&#10;&#10;";1990;5.7967;1.0152;2;6;10;6;Action / Dexterity, Card Game, Children's Game, Party Game, Real-time

Start from one side of the board, spin a spinner (or roll a special die) to select your piece and try to build a pipeline over to ending points on the opposite side. You can rotate your pipeline if required, but not backtrack, so when your neighbour's pipe gets in your way, you have to build over or around.

Six of the colors correspond to question categories while the last color gives a new dice roll. Six spaces along the track are &quot;pie spaces&quot;, and from these there are &quot;spokes&quot; of track leading to the middle of the board.&#10;&#10;Players roll a die and move along the track in any direction they like. When a player stops on a color they get a question of the appropriate category. If the player answers a question correctly while on a pie space, they get a pie of that color (assuming they don't already have it). A correct answer on another square allows the player to roll again.&#10;&#10;Once the player has one pie in each color, she can move along the spokes to the middle of the board to win the game.&#10;&#10;";1981;5.25135;1.6329;2;24;90;12;Party Game, Trivia

2960;Camden;"Camden is a game about drawing and laying cards (acting as tiles) to form a highly abstracted street market. What sets the game apart from other games in the tile-laying genre is that the cards can be placed almost anywhere on the board and in almost any orientation.  Cards may touch at corners, and the corner of one card may touch the side of another.&#10;&#10;Players advance by purchasing stores formed by the cards and collecting revenue from those stores at the beginning of each subsequent turn. Symbols on cards may trigger effects when drawn, either destroying or emptying the largest store, or giving players bonus payouts.&#10;&#10;Victory is achieved by the first player to reach 50 points.&#10;&#10;Since revenue comes from the quality of your store, but other players can play tiles to alter that store, the overall result is a cutthroat mind-bender, making it one of the most popular games of Cheapass&#039;s Hip Pocket Games series. The game was originally released as Agora in 2002, with the theme of an ancient Greek marketplace.&#10;&#10;";2002;6.27009;1.9091;2;4;20;10;Abstract Strategy, Card Game, City Building, Economic, Print & Play
2962;Inner Circle;"In Inner Circle each player places their pieces on the outer rim of the hexagonal board.  On a player's turn, the player moves a piece the number of dots that are underneath that piece (no peeking, it's touch and move).  The aim is to land in survival spots in the board.  After all the spots are claimed, the board is lifted out, and the pieces that didn't make it are left behind.  This repeats until all but one player's pieces are eliminated, or the last piece makes it to the center spot on the fourth board.&#10;&#10;";1981;5.45574;1.6061;2;4;20;8;Abstract Strategy, Maze, Puzzle
2964;Underwriter;"Underwriter, The Names Game, is an insurance game in which 4 players become Names at Lloyd's of London, taking on risks in the Aviation, Marine, Non-Marine and Motor markets. Each player has a Syndicate board and puts tokens into each Market slot. You roll and move round the board, drawing the relevant market card which may show a profit or loss (eg opening of new airport increases premiums for Aviation syndicates, football team trashing hotel costs Non-marine claims damages). You can also gain Stop Loss markers and face a Solvency test. You win by your Syndicate getting 4 tokens in each Market and passing the Solvency test.&#10;A nicely made set with a quarter-board, but, being a British game, there is no more thought than roll &amp; move and draw hazard cards.

2970;Squatter;"&quot;The Australian Wool Game&quot;&#10;&#10;In Squatter, 2 to 6 Players play as Australian sheep farmers (known colloquially as Squatters) as they work to become the most successful farmer. Each player starts with a sheep station, consisting of 5 Natural Pasture paddocks, fully stocked with 3 'pens' of sheep per paddock. Throughout the game players will earn money by buying and selling their sheep as well as from selling wool once per 'year' (circulation of the board) at the 'Wool sale' space. Players will spend this money to Improve and Irrigate their pastures. As players make their way around the board they will encounter many challenges and face the tribulations of Australian farmers including treating Foot Rot, being injured by a tractor and most devastating of all, droughts. The game ends once one player has Irrigated all of their pastures and stocked each of them with 6 pens of sheep, 30 pens in total, becoming the most successful farmer and winning the game.&#10;&#10;The game has no player elimination element and everyone stays in the game until the end.&#10;&#10;Squatter is a quintessential Australian game, becoming an icon of Australian culture and a staple in many Australian homes since it's release at the Royal Melbourne Show in 1962 on the Australian Wool Bureau stand. Squatter has sold over 500,000 copies and is the most successful board game ever developed in Australia.&#10;&#10;";1962;5.70062;1.4667;2;6;90;10;Animals, Economic, Farming

If approved the player takes the top card from the 'Story' deck and places it on their newspaper page. Copy can be substituted for a higher value as the player attempts to get stories from each of the several categories required.

2982;Task Force;"In the late 1950's this game was sold in ads in comic books.  You could order a copy for $1.25, complete with 2 boards, rules, and over 80 plastic pieces.&#10;&#10;This game is very similar to Battleship, with a few additional rules.  Each player has a gameboard (printed on cardstock-paper), later boards from the late 70's were printed on plastic with no backing at all, with 3 islands on it.  Players place all of their units on their board (secretly; you can't see your opponent's board) at the beginning of the game.  Units consist of Head Quarters, Tanks, Pill Boxes, Battleships, Destroyers, Landing barges, Aircraft Carriers, and Planes.&#10;&#10;The objective is to locate which island the enemy HQ is on (when you sink the enemy Battleship, they must tell you if their HQ is on the North or South half of the board), destroy all enemy installations in that island, and send a landing barge to occupy it.  You can also win the game by destroying both enemy barges (so they have no way to land on your HQ island anymore) or by destroying all enemy planes and ships (they can no longer attack).&#10;&#10;Jean Shepherd (best known for the movie &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;) mentioned an ad for Task Force on his June 18, 1963 radio show.

2986;Web and Starship;"&quot;Web and Starship&quot; is a strategic space wargame, in which Earth is caught between two races. The Gwynhyfarr, who roam the galaxy in faster-than-light starships, and the Pereen, who link their planets together in a trans-dimensional &quot;web&quot; which permits instantaneous movement from one system to another. Earth is weak and lies directly between its two opponents, but its society is vigorous and expanding. They can use technologies of both other races.&#10;&#10;The game is unique as it is practically the only balanced three player wargame in existence.

2990;Balanx;"Balanx is a 2 player balancing game by Kris Burm. The game has a low plastic see-saw grid with spaced grooves. Players have 10 heavy glass marbles in black and white, the same as found in Abalone, and 2 small steel ball bearings.&#10;Players start with their marbles on the opposite side and corner of the grid and move them towards themselves forwards and sideways, but not diagonally. The trick is that before a player moves, they hold the balancing board down on their side, making the marbles roll along the grooves and changing the set up entirely. In addition, the steel balls run in side grooves, affecting the balance of the board and making the game very challenging.&#10;The winner is the first to get their balls across to their corner, but if any balls are left in the opponents corner to block a finish, you lose. &#10;Rules in English, French, Dutch and Swedish.&#10;&#10;Was awarded the title &quot;Best Abstract Strategy Game&quot; by Games Magazine in 1997.&#10;&#10;";1993;5.29456;1.95;2;2;20;8;Abstract Strategy

2998;Reds! The Russian Civil War 1918-1921;"Reds! The Russian Civil War 1918-1921 is a two-player wargame covering these dramatic events from August 1918 to the start of 1921, when the last organized opposition to Red rule outside the far east was destroyed.&#10;&#10;The single large-hex map stretches from Warsaw in the west to Omsk in the east and from Murmansk in the north to Tashkent in the south. Across this vast expanse, players maneuver a colorful array of combat units representing various White factions, Anarchists, Nationalists, Alied Intervention Forces, the two divisions of the Czech Legion, and six Polish armies.&#10;&#10;Units range from armies to brigades. The Red Order of Battle is built around 16 Red Armies organized by Leon Trotsky. There are also two powerful Red cavalry armies and the elite Latvian Rifle division. The White Order of Battle includes everything from Cossack cavalry corps to Muslim partisans and a German Free Corps. Each side also has support units: naval and river flotillas, air units, and, of course, the famous armored trains. Key leaders are also included: Frunze, Denikin, Wrangel, and Trotsky and his famous Red Train.&#10;&#10;To model the chaos of this many-sided multi-front war, the sequence of play is based upon random chit pull which determines the order of activation of each White faction or six Red Army Front commands. The key Logistics phase, in which disrupted units are rallied and unsupplied units attritted, is also randomly determined. The game also includes TWO random event tables: one for each side.&#10;From sweeping cavalry advances to slogging matches over major cities (such as Tsaritsyn - the future Stalingrad - know as the Red Verdun), Reds! is a true player's game. It is also a realistic depiction of some of the most titanic and unusual campaigns of modern history.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;    One 22 x 34&quot; Game Map&#10;    One Sheet of 240 Counters&#10;    Two Player Aid Cards&#10;    One Rule Book &#10;&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE     1-2 months per turn&#10;MAP SCALE     65 miles per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE     Brigades, Divisions, Corps, and Armies&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS     Two&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Ted Raicer&#10;DEVELOPER: Andy Lewis and Volko Ruhnke&#10;ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

3004;UNO Dice;"Includes three ways to play.&#10;&#10;Game 1&#10;&#10;Each player draws four dice. Each player on their turn draws, rolls their dice, and places one of them in the dice tray. Any dice added to the tray must match by colour, number or letters. The first player to get rid of her dice is the winner.&#10;&#10;Game 2&#10;&#10;Game 2 is a variant of Yacht where the object is to have the highest points score after 11 rounds of play. The player draws five dice out of the bag and rolls all of them. The player may then take up to two more rolls with their choice of one or more of these five dice. Simply put aside the dice you do not want to roll, and roll the rest. Any of these dice may be rolled in any of your three rolls, except that all five must be rolled on the first roll. At the end of your turn, you must score your exposed dice faces in one of the eleven spaces in your column of the scoring sheet. If you cannot or do not wish to enter a score in any of the eleven spaces, then you must score a zero in your choice of one of the eleven spaces.&#10;&#10;Game 3&#10;&#10;All 24 spaces in the dice tray are used for Game 3. A player draws one die out of the bag, rolls it, and places it face up in any one of the 24 dice spaces in the tray. After the starting die is placed in the tray, the player to the left of the starting player draws four dice out of the bag and rolls them. The player looks at the dice to see if any of these can match the die already in the tray. The dice can match by either number, color or letter in any combination. If a match can be made, the player places the die in the tray and scores points. Dice are scored by making strings of two or more adjacent dice, all of the same color or kind. All numbered faces (0 through 9) score as their numerical value. The R, S and D2 each score as 20 points. The W and WD4 are not scored.&#10;&#10;After a player finishes their turn, the next player takes a turn using the same dice. Thus a player will usually begin her turn with one less die than the previous player. In this way, the first player will have four dice to roll, the second three, the third will have two, and so on. When a player, down to only one die, is able to play it, then the next player starts the pattern over again by drawing four fresh dice from the bag, rolls them and play proceeds from there.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the dice tray is full. The winner is the player with the highest total score.&#10;&#10;";1987;4.92467;1.125;2;6;20;7;Abstract Strategy, Dice

The player who has been checkmated loses and the third player loses as well, no matter whether this player only passively assisted or even consciously or unconsciously helped the checkmating player.

The piano is excellent and getting the pacing of the tunes makes all the difference.

3008;Wicketz;"Wicketz is a Cricket sim using a quarter-board for the wicket, model batsmen, fielders, bowlers and umpires, a spinner for the deliveries and 246 cards for the strokes. The fielding player sets the field, the board showing concentric circles around the wicket divided into segments, selects Pace or Spin for the over and spins the delivery, eg. Good Length, Long Hop, Bouncer/Googly. Upon seeing the field and the delivery, the batting player declares a stroke, eg Cut, Cover Drive, Pull, Hook, Leg Glance. There are 12 strokes and an avoiding action if a bouncer is bowled. A card is drawn and the result determined. Initially, the delivery may defeat the batsman, so if a Cut was played, the card might read Bowled if Yorker, whereas a Straight Drive gets an LBW if Good Length. If the bowler wasn't out, the next column shows the segment the ball was struck to. If there is no fielder there, the runs are scored from the card, 0 to 4 with a very rare 6. But if there is a fielder present no runs are scored, and if the card is also marked catch, a catch is possible. This is determined by another spinner, but the higher order get 3 and 2 lives, the tail are out first time. Normal cricket rules apply and the game has advanced rules for bowling &amp; fielding variants.&#10;Sumo has the original publisher as A W Compton producing a limited 200 edition. The set I have is by RDA Marketing and Luding reckons the designer is Richard Pullen. Although my rules set refers to a card dispenser and a window display, the game doesn't have them. I can't figure out the relevance of selecting Pace or Spin whatsoever, so I suspect the earlier edition had more to it. Solid sim of limited appeal (geddit!).&#10;&#10;";1989;6.41885;2.6667;2;2;60;10;Sports
3009;King of the Mountain;"(From the introduction) King of the Mountain is a moderate skill-level strategy game for 2 to 10 players, Ages 8 and up. The object of the game is to be the first player to have his/her character reach the Citadel at the top of the mountain, which is the center hex of the game board. Players guide their character-counter from the board's edge, which is the base of the mountain, along paths and through tunnels in order to get to the peak. Attempting to stop the players is a malevolent Wizard, played by one of the players. The Wizard controls the different monsters on the mountain, causing them to seek out the characters and do battle with them. The object for the Wizard player is to see that no one reaches the Citadel. Depending on the number of players, the game should last between 45 minutes (two players)and 3 hours (10 players).&#10;&#10;(additional comments) One of the nice things is that each character can customize the stats and equipment of their characters.&#10;&#10;";1980;3.82353;2.3333;2;10;180;8;Adventure, Fantasy, Fighting, Wargame

The player's piece is moved according to the results of the group vote.&#10;&#10;This game was featured on an episode of &quot;All In The Family&quot; (&quot;The Games Bunkers Play&quot;, Season 4, Episode 8) and has a definite late-sixties/early-seventies feel to it.&#10;&#10;";1969;5.45263;1.0;3;8;60;7;Medical, Party Game
3014;HiQue;"HiQue bills itself as &quot;the missing link between Chess and Checkers&quot;. Play is on a 7x7 board, but the black and white squares are rotated 45 degrees so as to appear as diamonds to the players. There are 9 pieces per side: 5 &quot;runners&quot; and 4 &quot;guards&quot;. The object is to get a runner from your back row to the opponent's back row. Runners may move one space forward or to either side, but not backwards. Guards may move any number of unobstructed spaces in any of the 4 directions. Due to the diamond formation, guards are always on black squares and runners always on white squares.&#10;&#10;Runners may be captured if 2 enemy guards occupy adjacent spaces. Multiple runners may be captured in one move of a guard in this manner. Guards may never be captured. Play ends when one runner makes it to the enemy back line, or all of one side's runners are eliminated.&#10;&#10;This game plays quickly and easily. There aren't a lot of pieces, and the runners are in constant jeopardy from the guards. This is a game of deterrent: making sure your opponent doesn't take your pieces by setting up attacks of your own.&#10;&#10;The sides seem to be the safest places for runners, but they're very vulnerable anywhere.&#10;&#10;A &quot;lite&quot; game that is perfect for a few quick matches on a rainy day.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.6865;1.3333;2;2;30;7;Abstract Strategy

3035;The Last Days of the Grande Armee: The Four Days of Waterloo;"The time is: 1630 hrs., 15 June 1815...The Imperial Guard light cavalry of Lefebvre-Desnottes encountered the Nassau infantry of Bernhard, Duke of Saxe-Weimar. The Duke had taken the initiative to move one of his two regiments south from the vital crossroads of Quatre-Bras, in the rolling countryside of Flanders, to delay the lead elements of the French advance.&#10;&#10;The French horsemen found the village of Frasnes occupied by a regiment of 1500 Orange-Nassau infantry. The Guard troopers began to ride around the town on both sides, threatening a double envelopment. Observing this, the Nassauers started to withdraw back up the road toward Waterloo.&#10;&#10;The Guard Chasseurs Regiment, 1100 men under the command of General Francois Lallemand, pursued them off the road into the woods of Bossu, capturing 15 men.&#10;At the same time, the 800 Lancers of the Guard continued straight for Quatre-Bras itself. Their commander, General Colbert de la Chabanais, rode behind with a small escort, into the walled-farm of Genioncourt.&#10;&#10;By pre-arranged signal, the 2600 troops of the 2nd Nassau Regiment, who remained in Quatre-Bras, set fire to a beacon and fired their 8 guns, alerting the rest of the Anglo-Allied army further up the road, toward Waterloo. As the Lancers approached the crossroads, the two Nassau regiments in the town and in the woods on their flank kept up a fire of musketry which made it impossible for them to remain in their exposed position on the open road.&#10;&#10;Had the Lancers succeeded in hustling the Duke's Nassau troops from Quatre-Bras as they had done in at Frasnes, the battle to be fought there the next day would have been a defensive one for the French.

3041;Panzergruppe Guderian;"&quot;Panzergruppe Guderian&quot;: The Battle of Smolensk, July 1941, is a wargame simulation of the German campaign to capture Smolensk in July, 1941.  The game is played in twelve turns, each one representing 2 days time, on a map scale of 10.5 km/hex.&#10;&#10;This wargame is famous for its innovative use of &quot;untried&quot; Soviet units.  These untried Soviet counters enter play face down, their combat strength unknown to either player, until they take part in combat, at which time they are flipped to reveal their strength and defense numbers.&#10;&#10;The game also models the effectiveness of German operations by allowing them a full mechanized movement phase both before and after combat, while the Soviets only move prior to combat.  In addition, if all of a German division's regiments attack or defend in the same hex, their strength is doubled by a divisional integrity bonus.&#10;&#10;The German player scores victory points for the capture of cities, and for any Soviet units redirected from the Southwestern Front.  The Soviet player scores vp for recaptured cities and destroying entire German divisions (which possess several steps of strength).&#10;&#10;The game includes: 1 map, counters (AH edition = 260; SPI edition = 200), 1 6-sided die, 1 Soviet reference card, 1 German reference card, 1 rules book, and 1 advanced rules insert.&#10;&#10;";1976;7.36536;2.7938;2;2;300;14;Wargame, World War II

3044;Air Assault on Crete / Invasion of Malta: 1942;"Avalon Hill's epic German airborne attack game.&#10;&#10;Air Assault on Crete simulates the first totally airborne invasion in history, with the Germans overwhelming the rag-tag Allied survivors of the ill-fated Greek Campaign.  It is is a strategic, battalion level game, with traditional turn sequencing, including air missions, bombardment, move and combat.  Units have attack, defense and movement values, as well as stacking limits.  There are fairly standard terrain effects and zones of control, but no mandatory attacks.&#10;&#10;This package features a bonus game, Invasion of Malta: 1942, which re-creates the hypothetical German-Italian invasion of Malta (and even a third game, if you count the variant from the General magazine, Volume 18, #3, Assault on Cyprus).

3045;Pentantastar;"Players control the East and the West factions. Either East or West can win by military or by magic forces. Armies of mounted and foot soldiers and fleets of ships contest victory by capturing key places. But even a military victory depends upon control of magic. As magic releases powers of earth, air, water, light, and fire, the wizards grow in strength, volcanoes erupt, storms sweep the mountains and seas, and the creatures of magic join the struggle for both sides. When all five charms are assembled, the completed Pentantastar is a dangerous weapon. If carried to Lug Balor, the East wins, if carried to the Wizard Council, the West wins. Victory depends upon taking advantage of military and magic opportunities, and surviving immediate threats, disasters, and treachery.&#10;&#10;";1983;5.68769;2.1667;2;4;120;12;Fantasy, Wargame

3047;Rails Through the Rockies;"Railroad game on track construction in Colorado. The emphasis is on finding the fastest and most profitable route from the eastern states to Grand Junction. Money to build is earned by creating a rail network to cities, towns and mines, with the mining being rather abstract(mines open and close as random events). Players must worry about the details of track types, passes and tunnels. In addition, there is an events deck which has a large effect on play. As there are really only about three good ways through the mountains, this is the optimal number of players.&#10;&#10;In 1995 Winsome Games released Rocky Mountain Rails as an expansion kit to the game.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Rocky Mountain Rails&#10;&#10;&#10;";1981;5.63095;3.125;2;4;240;0;Trains

3053;Bonaparte in Italy;"In the Winter of 1796, Napoleon Bonaparte was commander of the Reserve Army, a politically visible and published critic of conduct on the ongoing war against the First Coalition.&#10;Through he had no apparent qualifications, his close proximity to the Directory and the influence of his freshly-made bride earned him the command of the quiescent Army of Italy, his first field command, at the age of 26. At once he turned his deep theoretical understanding, in a lightning campaign, against the tottering Sardinian Kingdom and its ally, Austria. By the end of April, he had gained for his army a corner of the fertile Po Valley. From there, in a series of six further operations over the next ten months, the French Army conquered and successfully defended the remainder of the Valley and the key to an advance into Austria, the fortress of Mantua.&#10;&#10;Rules: 24 pages incl.

3057;Warp 6;"Warp 6 is a mostly abstract race game where players have a fleet of starships (which are represented 4-, 6-, and 8-sided dice) trying to go down a spiral path to the center wormhole. During a turn a player moves one of his or her ships along the the spiral exactly the number on the die.  A player can choose to change the number on a die up or down by one instead of moving.&#10;&#10;The game revolves around attempting to land on other ships (friendly or otherwise) which allows sliding down at least one loop of spiral until it reaches an unoccupied spot, thus cutting out a lot of transit time.  When this happens, the die is rolled before it is placed in its landing spot to receive a new number. Typically, long chains are formed which can be taken advantage of by all players. Knowing when to form, break, take advantage of, and foil the use of these chains is the key to winning.&#10;&#10;In the three-player version, the first player to get 4 of their 6 ships out wins.

3058;Schaumermal;"Schaumermal is a board game aimed at simulating a federation football (henceafter simply called football) match.  Each player manages a team of 11 players (10 players and a goalkeeper) on a rectangular board with the lines of a football pitch printed on it and overlaid with a grid.&#10;&#10;In a regular game, the two players set up their teams (of 10 players and a goalkeeper) in their halves.  One side is nominated the home team (the other, the away team) and starts off the game.  The game is played in turns.  During each turn, the team in possession of the ball passes or kicks the ball, and moves 3 players.  The opposing team then moves 3 of its players to interfere with the other's play.  Different playing positions of the team (e.g. striker, dribblers, etc) move differently.&#10;&#10;The aim of the team in possession of the ball is to put the ball into the net of the opposing team (thus scoring a goal), and its opponent aims to stop it from doing so by blocking the paths towards goal and tackling opposing players to gain possession of the ball.  Whether a ball is kicked accurately to its target location or how much it deviated off-course is determined by the roll of a die.  The results of tackles are determined by comparing dice rolls.&#10;&#10;The game lasts until a pre-determined time elapses (in which case the team who has scored the most goals wins) or a team has scored a pre-determined number of goals (and wins).  The game includes rules for variants such as Hocus Pocus cards that allow players to change the events of play, customization of each individual player (introducing ability points and skills), and league play.&#10;&#10;";2001;6.96304;3.0;2;2;60;0;Sports

Garis (1872-1961) created the character &quot;Uncle Wiggily Longears&quot; for a children's book in 1910.

Whitehill states that Parker Brothers obtained the rights to Uncle Wiggily in 1967. However, in 1989 both Milton Bradley Co. and Parker Brothers reintroduced different version of the same game. Hasbro now owns both the Parker and Bradley rights, but apparently is producing the Bradley version for the current market.

3076;Puerto Rico;"In 'Puerto Rico', players assume the roles of colonial governors on the island of Puerto Rico. The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.&#10;&#10;Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.&#10;&#10;The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.&#10;&#10;During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as &quot;Trader&quot; or &quot;Builder&quot;). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the &quot;Builder&quot; role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.&#10;&#10;Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanism in which a &quot;governor&quot; token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.&#10;&#10;Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned &quot;large buildings.&quot; Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.&#10;&#10;In 2011 and mostly afterwards, Puerto Rico was published to include both Puerto Rico: Expansion I &ndash; New Buildings and Puerto Rico: Expansion II &ndash; The Nobles. These versions are included in the other game entry Puerto Rico, not this regular game entry for Puerto Rico. Some editions of Puerto Rico list the player count as 2-5 instead of 3-5, and they include variant rules for games with only two players.&#10;&#10;";2002;7.90508;3.2686;3;5;150;12;City Building, Economic, Farming
3078;Knockabout;"Knockabout is an abstract board game where players are trying to push the other players' pieces off the hexagonal board.  The pieces are 4-, 6-, and 8-sided dice which move in a straight line as far as the number on their top face.  Whenever a die gets hit by other pieces (friendly or otherwise), the last die to move as a result of the collision gets rerolled. Pieces knocked into the outer ring are eliminated from the game, but still can prevent future pieces from being knocked into the same spot.  The first player to knock five out of his opponent's nine pieces into the outer ring wins.&#10;&#10;The game is mostly a mixture of attempting to maneuver ones pieces into strong positions, gently bumping them to get high numbers, and sabotaging the opponents' positions so their pieces have more limited movement.&#10;&#10;";2001;6.7096;2.5556;2;2;20;10;Abstract Strategy, Dice

3092;Spritfresser;"The game comes in a tube with a rolled up board that lays flat when laid out. The board depicts a motor racing circuit which varies in width from 2 squares to 4. The winner is the first past the post and the rules recommend a minimum of 3 laps.  The track and other charts are printed on something akin to vinyl.&#10;&#10;Drivers choose a speed from 1 - 12 squares with the cost of the moves measured in fuel use.  The larger the change in gears (up or down), the more fuel is used.  Corners have an ideal speed, and exceeding that can cause tire wear, speed loss, and movement to the outside of the curve.  Engine wear at high speeds can also take place.&#10;&#10;";1994;5.5;0.0;2;6;90;12;Racing

3099;Gettysburg;"One of the original set of Avalon Hill &quot;Adult Games&quot; that includes U-Boat, Tactics II, Verdict, and Dispatcher.&#10;&#10;This is one of the earliest &quot;typical&quot; wargames, with movement/strength counters, order of appearance chart, CRT, etc.&#10;&#10;Board has square grid with squares 1&quot; = 1/4 mile. One hour turns.&#10;&#10;27 Confederate counters&#10;41 Union counters&#10;&#10;Units include infantry, artillery, cavalry, HQs (but had no use), and outposts (pickets, not in '64 Ed.).&#10;&#10;Roberts redesigned this game in 1961 with hexagons.  Although it sold out, Roberts wasn't happy with it.  He then re-released it in 1964 with squares again, like the 1958 version.  However, the rules were significantly changed.&#10;&#10;The 1958 version was basically a miniatures game on a map.  You used range cards (shown in the illustration) both to move your units and then to check their firing range.  Units could rotate on their centers before checking with a range card, which was placed along the front side of the rectangular pieces.  You got better odds hitting from a flank.  Artillery had double range the of infantry or cavalry (this was only optional as far as I know). There were at least 3 slightly different rule books for the '58, '59, &amp; '60 Ed., all were basically the '58 one.&#10;&#10;The game also had optional rules for hidden movement.  You left the room while your opponent put his pieces on the board and moved them, recorded their new positions and removed them again!  If they came within sight of a unit (including an outpost unit), he had to tell you where they were seen, or leave them on the board if still in sight.  Line of sight rules for all this.&#10;&#10;The 1964 version required you to keep your units aligned with the square grid rather than the free form miniatures style movement of the 1958 version. This really didn't work well. Units facing diagonally had to be adjacent to form a solid wall of ZOC sqs. to their front and could not therefore protect their flanks if they spread out any at all. This made doubled and tripled attacks easily possible.&#10;&#10;Every version would benefit from a road movement bonus rule, x3 at a minimum (but x4 would be better, units that move this fast should not be able to attack that turn, though).&#10;&#10;";1958;5.7149;2.2292;2;2;240;12;American Civil War, Civil War, Post-Napoleonic, Wargame
3100;Backpacks and Blisters;"Set in the Lake District of Cumbria, England, players attempt to visit as many cafes, scenic views and beauty spots as possible in the time allotted. Players manage their cards to move as efficiently as possible over the network of routes printed on the map.&#10;&#10;As the day wears on players &quot;tire&quot; and move more slowly as their hand diminishes from 4 to 3 to 2 cards. Other hindrances include blister cards which are useless to your hand, and the heavy rucksack which slows your movement. To aid your movement there are bus and ferry routes and bars of chocolate which all help speed your movement.&#10;&#10;The game includes rules, a linen &quot;tea-towel&quot; map, a deck of laminated cards, plastic pawns, and several sheets of cardboard counters.&#10;&#10;";1993;6.21304;2.0;1;6;45;10;Exploration, Humor, Travel

3102;Banque Fatale;"In Banque Fatale, players bid with colorful chips for cards (called Card Fatales) which show an Ace or Aces in the 5 colors. The value of the colors start at 6 million and rise and fall according to the total chips played. The most dominant color bid rises by 2 million (as long as there were at least 2 chips of that color submitted). But if only one chip of a certain color was bid, that color falls by 1 million. If no chips of a color were bid, that color tanks in value all the way to the bottom of the chart (only worth 2 million now). If a color reaches 11 or 12, there is a pay-out for each Ace of that color owned by all the players (5 or 6 million), and that color's value is reset to 6 million.&#10;&#10;Then the bid chips are drafted back, one by one, starting with the player to the left of the auction winner. So if you didn't bid at all, you'll be taking chips from high bidders.&#10;&#10;Finally, then the starting player can sell a Card Fatale to the bank at its current value or values (cannot sell the card just won in the auction). The player clockwise to the starting player is now the starting player. When the deck of 16 cards runs out, cards held are cashed out, chips still held are worth 1 million each (variant suggests they are worth nil), and the most cash wins.&#10;&#10;It isn't clear if players should hide the cards they own, or if it should be an open knowledge game, which would greatly affect the dynamic. An amusing mechanism that draws you to brinkmanship.&#10;&#10;Simple and smart, you'd reckon this was a Knizia game, but it's not!&#10;&#10;";1997;6.05922;1.75;3;4;45;10;Economic

And 4 long wooden sticks, 36cm square cut wooden sticks. &#10;The game is essentially a chess game for four players. The tiles change their &quot;roles&quot; depending on the color of the square they are on. As the game moves on, the playing field is reduced in size by the wooden sticks, until it is a minimum of 3x3 squares big. This prevents drawn out final duels.&#10;&#10;";1990;6.53704;2.0;2;4;30;4;Animals

This is done by drawing and laying tiles, where the edges of the tiles must match those they are laid adjacent to on the paddock boards.  Action cards allow a leader to be kept in check, and the need to keep your herd together so it is harder for others to raid it adds to the decision making.&#10;&#10;";1997;4.16667;0.0;2;6;30;6;American West

The key challenges are to discover what color each other player is collecting and deciding which color to collect oneself. Play several hands to determine an overall winner.&#10;&#10;Simple rules also make it possible to play with children as young as 7.&#10;&#10;";2001;5.64062;1.0;2;5;45;7;Card Game, Children's Game

Players state the values of their armies (a player can attack an opponent with more than one army), but in doing so can bluff this value. The defender can admit defeat and pay one 'power point' for every attacking army, or not believe the opposing declaration and cards are revealed. The loser now pays 2 'power points' per army. The strength cards are burned and new cards drawn by each player. For every 3 'power points' a player hold, they can control an area of Europe (by claiming it with 1 of their 7 metal towers). If a player runs out of points, a tower must be cashed back in and so a region is lost.&#10;&#10;";1979;6.05043;2.5;2;4;180;12;Bluffing, Fighting, Miniatures, Napoleonic, Wargame

The Colour tiles have values, multipliers and different abilities, such as removing tiles, affecting distant tiles and so on. These are not obvious, so constantly refering to the rules will slow the game.&#10;Grey has a starting fund and must buy and place or move tiles to generate income. Colour must turn Grey tiles over to disrupt the boring real world and prevent Grey from finishing with a profit. The game can be made harder for Colour by giving Grey more starting money.

3128;Clippers;"Remade and re-themed Santa Fe. Players own trading settlements on islands in the Pacific and must attempt to get trade routes established in order to make those settlements score points. Trade routes are established by connecting various different shipping companies, represented by different colored Clippers, to land at your island. The more Clippers that land at an island, the more points a settlement there will be worth.&#10;&#10;Players control creation of trade routes by six trading companies by laying down wooden sticks that advance the appropriate clipper. The different islands have point values, as well as a set amount of potential settlements and a number of ports that clippers can land at. Throughout the game phases, players will have to manage placing their settlements, claiming option cards, laying track segments, and adding new clippers. With no luck involved, it is a difficult task to both advance the clippers in the way you want without alerting your opponents to your plans. Successful play heavily involves taking advantage of situations your opponents leave open and capitalizing on ports that they make valuable.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, an island will be worth its value multiplied by the number of different companies that have landed at it. Duplicate landings by the same company do not increase the score. For every settlement you have on an island, you will score points. For instance, an island with a base value of 5 that has 3 different companies will be worth 15 points. If you have placed 2 settlements there, it will earn you 30 points. Place your ports too early and no one will send ships there; place them too late and you may not get a spot!&#10;&#10;";2002;6.55598;2.6139;2;5;60;10;Economic, Nautical

3135;GLE'X;"GLE'X (brief for 'trianGLE EXpertise') is a mental challenge. The board is made up of a number of differently colored and sized triangles. The opponents move their 8 pieces with the goal to advance to the&#10;end position or to reduce the number of the opponent's pieces to fewer then four.&#10;Forming triangles is part of the strategy. The 'hot zone' makes play more exciting.&#10;&#10;";1998;0.0;0.0;2;2;45;8;Abstract Strategy
3136;Z-Chess;"Z-Chess is a cross between the game of GLE'X and conventional chess. Two GLE'X boards put together - overlapping in the middle - make up the playing field. Conventional chess pieces - with the addition of a second Queen - are used to play the game. The goal, just like in the ancient game, is to capture the opponent's King. The strategy is similar as well, however, the nature of the Z-Chess board requires the pieces to move differently. The Rooks are more powerful than the Queens, resulting from the way they move. A single Rook attacks all 77 &quot;squares&quot; when other pieces are removed from the board.&#10;The &quot;squares&quot; actually are circles at the intersections, same way as on the GLE'X board.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.0;3.0;2;2;90;12;Abstract Strategy
3137;Anno Domini: Erfindungen;"Each Anno Domini set consists of 340 cards, with a description of a historical event on one side of the card, and the year in which it happened on the other.&#10;Each player receives nine of these cards, and may only look at the descriptions. Each player in turn puts a card on the table, trying to put them in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.&#10;If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.&#10;Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure and are hard to date.&#10;&#10;Part of the Anno Domini series.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.69804;1.4681;2;8;30;10;Bluffing, Party Game, Trivia

Then you can use blocks collected at the sites to build pyramids for more points, and the majority of blocks on a site gets the most points. Also, a die chooses which finger you have to use to flick the blocks. Kind of a golf/billiards/El Grande hybrid.&#10;&#10;";2002;5.88538;1.2593;2;5;30;8;Action / Dexterity, Dice
3139;Goldland;"Each player has a backpack with room for 12 tools, provisions, trading goods, or treasures.  The number of squares you can move on a turn is the number of empty spaces in your backpack, so the lighter you travel, the faster.&#10;&#10;In the beginning, only 13 tiles (two legs of a 7x7 square) are on the table, and everybody starts in the corner with three fish (provisions) and two pearl necklaces (trading goods).  One thing to do on your turn is &quot;explore,&quot; adding a randomly drawn tile next to the one where your pawn currently stands.  The board gradually fills in to the point where the tile at the opposite corner from the start is drawn, and this tile is designated the site of the lost temple and pays bonuses for everyone who reaches it.  The sooner you get there, the better the bonuses.&#10;&#10;About half the squares are free to enter and let you obtain other items for your backpack.  If you're already carrying a fishing pole, for example, in some squares you'll be able to pick up more fish.  The other half are &quot;adventure&quot; tiles that require the expenditure of backpack items in order to gain entry.  You might have to spend two rifles, for example, to enter a wildcat tile; then you place a &quot;camp&quot; marker and can enter that tile for free in the future.  A lot of the game involves going back and forth to tiles where you can assemble the necessary items to work your way through the adventure tiles to the lost temple.&#10;&#10;Goldland appeals to puzzle-solvers and has a fun atmosphere of exploring the wilderness in search of El Dorado.&#10;&#10;";2002;6.61525;2.3841;2;5;80;10;Exploration

3141;The Bucket King;"Card game with unusual scoring. Players play sets of animal cards trying to knock over each other's pyramids of buckets. Cards in hand can be used to attack and defend their colour buckets, taking out lower buckets causes cascades.&#10;&#10;The deck is five colours (farm animals) numbered 1-8, with two 1s and two 8s. Players start with 12 cards.  The start player plays 1-3 cards of one colour, giving a total sum. This total attacks the player to their left, who either plays 1-3 cards of the same colour totalling higher to defend, or loses a bucket. If they do defend though, that total then attacks the player to their left and so on, round the table. If it gets back to the start player, then can add 1-3 more cards to their original play, increasing the total. At some point, a player cannot defend, and buckets go tumbling. If you match the total attacking you this reverses the direction of play, meaning the cards already played are being added to additional cards to create high totals.&#10;&#10;Players look at their starting hand before building their pyramid o' buckets, so it pays to put your weak colours at the top.&#10;&#10;If you play a cards or cards, you draw back only one card from the draw deck. If you forget, tough! The game ends when a pre-set number of players lose all their buckets, the number increases with the number playing. The player with the most remaining is the winner.&#10;&#10;A game comes with enough buckets for 6 players, but you can play with multiple sets to allow larger groups to play. This works well as action down the far end of the table means you are safe, while the reversal mechanism means that there can be a build up of a lead to an unmatchable number before it breaks out of that end of the table.&#10;&#10;Seemingly a game of luck, but noticable that the same players keep winning and with experience the winning margins keep getting reduced.&#10;&#10;";2002;6.34496;1.2316;2;6;45;10;Animals, Card Game

The Chinese, in common with many other Asian people, believe that every person will demonstrate in their lives those qualities of temperament of the special animal which controls the year of their birth.&#10;Players can discover what Animal Year they were born in by looking for their year of birth around each animal picture on the board. The Chinese Year, unlike the Western Year, runs from February to January, so remember this as you discover your animal sign. For example, a person born in January 1956 would be a goat, whereas a person born in February 1956 would be a Monkey.&#10;Operation of the Tile Dispenser&#10;Tiles are drawn one by one from the Dispenser by firmly pushing down on the lever on the side of the Dispenser. Occasionally, and especially when very few tiles are left in the Dispenser, no tile will be dealt on the first push of the lever. Simply push again, until a tile appears.&#10;Game set up&#10;Put all of the tiles in the Dispenser and place the lid on top. Gently shake the Dispenser and place it in the center of the board. Each player chooses a Mandarin and places it on the board on the center Chinese Character space of their own animal sign. If two or more players share the same sign, simply place the Mandarins side by side on the same space.&#10;Object of the Game&#10;Players collect tiles and place them in the appropriate places on their Collection Cards. The game ends when one player has collected at least one tile of each animal type, or all 6 tiles of one animal set. The first player to do this is the winner.&#10;&#10;";1991;6.3692;1.25;3;5;50;8;

The cards are numbered (ruins), or are houses, towers, tornadoes, coloured jokers, and multi-coloured intersection cards. All cards have rainbow backs. Laying a numbered card on the Street starts a building, which extends down a column in numerical sequence and is completed as a ruin or house or tower. Laying an intersection starts a rainbow, which is filled in colour sequence. When structures are completed, they are removed to be scored, and the space in the Street is filled with a new construction.

The board shows the sea floor as a grid with shades indicating the levels of depth.&#10;&#10;Each round consists of three phases :&#10;&#10;-expanding the station : extra research stations will be added, these give advantages depending on their type, cost to build depends on the underwater landscape on which they are placed. More stations in use of the same type give better advantages. They must be occupied by a scientist before any advantage can be enjoyed.&#10;&#10;-deploying scientists : players must pay to bring them into the game. They can be moved around to start using the research stations. Once deployed they remain at this station.

3155;Lumberjack;"Woodcutters compete in their annual Lumberjack game where they use real timber as components. In preparation for the game someone has spray-painted 100 logs in 5 different colors, and stacked them in a huge round tower with layers of 6 logs arranged randomly.&#10;&#10;A player takes a free log from the tower and uses it to build his own tower. Each player may only&#10;construct 3 towers and only the bottom log of each tower may touch the table. When a player feels he cannot extend a tower any further he can crown it with a white cap. This prevents any further building on that tower and ensures double scoring. (After scoring the topmost piece is removed.)&#10;&#10;When all logs from the central tower has been used, there is final scoring, and the woodcutter with the most points wins a brand-new chain saw.&#10;&#10;Also included are 3 variants:&#10;&#10;&quot;Easy Going&quot;: The players build up to 5 individual towers, but each of only a single color.

3157;All-Star Baseball;"Designed by former major league player Ethan Allen and introduced in 1941, All-Star Baseball became one of the most popular sports games of all time.  The game is essentially a batting simulation of major league baseball, built around a spinner and player disks that are divided into sections in such a manner that a hitter has the probabilty of reproducing his real-life statistics in such important categories as home runs, triples, doubles, singles, walks, and strikeouts. In general, the game follows the basic rules of major league baseball.  Teams are created from the player disks supplied with the game (often a mix of current players and all-time greats such as Babe Ruth) and from player disks for other seasons published separately.  The team at bats places the appropriate player disk on the spinner, spins, and reads off the resulting number.  The game does not attempt to realistically simulate pitching and defense.  Thus a hitter's result from a time at bat is not affected by the opposing pitcher or the defensive prowess of the fielder to whom the ball may be hit, although the player in the field on some play outcomes is required to spin a second spinner to determine the advancement of base runners and other certain details.  Results of each play are recorded on the field using plastic pegs for the base runners, while runs and outs are tallied on a rotating scoreboard.  Cumulative runs scored are tallied on paper score sheets. Strategy discs are included that enable plays like sacrifice flies, stealing bases, bunting, hit and run, etc. The team with the most runs after nine innings (or extra innings, if needed) is the winner.&#10;&#10;";1941;6.05639;1.3077;2;2;60;10;Sports
3158;The Home Stretch;"Horse racing game released by Hasbro and NBC (Yes, the US Television company) in a format nearly identical to the 3M plastic &quot;wrap-around&quot; boards.&#10;&#10;The Home Stretch is a horse racing game. The players represent the owners and jockeys of the horses in the race and the people betting on the race.&#10;&#10;To start the game, each player is given a certain amount of cash. This money is used to bid on horses. Each horse is represented by an &quot;Ownership Card&quot; which shows the horse's name, stable and &quot;Speed&quot;. Speed is used to determine the likelihood of gaining an &quot;Advantage&quot; during the race. Bidding for each horse lasts three rounds and the high bidder gets the horse.&#10;&#10;Once the horses have been assigned their starting positions are determined and the Ownership Cards are placed in the &quot;Readout Machine&quot;. This is a tray which holds the cards and will be used to determine movement. After all the horses are in the tray &quot;Odds Cards&quot; are placed below each Ownership Card. Odds Cards will determine the actual movement of each horse.&#10;&#10;Players may now make wagers on any horse they choose. Wagers may be made on any number of horses and may be made for Win, Place or Show. The player records their bets on a &quot;Betting Slip&quot; and places it face down on the board, then pays the total amount of the bets.&#10;&#10;To run the race the spinner is used to generate a random number. This number is used on the Readout Machine to determine the number of spaces moved and the &quot;Diagonal Allowance&quot; for each horse. Each Odds card has a column of numbers for total movement and a second column for Diagonal allowance. The Diagonal Allowance is the number of diagonal moves the horse may make and is therefore the number of times the horse can change lanes. The horse must use all of its movement but does not have to use all of its allowed lane changes.  The spinner's random number determines which row of numbers on the Odds cards will be used in the current round for moving the horses along the track.&#10;&#10;Sometimes the spinner will indicate &quot;Advantage&quot;. When this happens an Advantage card is drawn. Advantage Cards each show the name of one horse and that horse is allowed a free move of 6 with a diagonal allowance of 2. Other horses may not move. The better a horse's speed, the more Advantage Cards that horse has in the deck.&#10;&#10;The race continues until all of the horses have crossed the finish line. If more than one horse crosses the line in the same turn the horse which moves the furtherest past the finish line is the winner. The second and third place horse is determined the same way.&#10;&#10;Once all the horses have crossed the finish line the betting slips are revealed and winning wagers are paid. The players then set up the horses and the Readout Machine for the next race. Ownership of the horses remains the same but the starting order and Odds Cards change.&#10;&#10;A total of six races are run. The player with the most cash at the end of all six races is the winner.&#10;&#10;This is a very good game. Players can spend a good deal of money buying the best horses at the start of the game, but they then have less cash to place bets with. Meanwhile, other players can bet on their horses anyway. Also, the randomness of the appearance of the Advantage Cards mean that a good horse can have a bad showing and the slowest horse may come from behind to win. There is nothing to prevent a player from betting on another horse and racing theirs badly to influence the outcome but the other players may be doing the same thing and the fact that six races are run means that no one is likely to try it more than once (though it may show up as a race 6 strategy). A very interesting game.&#10;&#10;";1970;6.80946;1.0;2;20;60;8;Racing, Sports

Apparently they were common on the Continent and are still used in places where lift doors would be unsafe, such as nuclear power stations. Anyway, this game has 9 thick cards showing various odd looking passengers going up or down in the lift, with some only partially shown. Each player has a deck of cards showing the same people, in different poses. The cabin cards are shuffled and laid out face-down in two columns of 5, with a gap and a pawn is placed next to the gap. First player to grab the die rolls it and moves the pawn clockwise to face a cabin. Players call out which person they think is in the cabin and the cabin card is turned up. If you're correct, you dump the matching card from your hand; if not, you keep it. But the cabin card is replaced face-down in the original empty space, not where it was previously. In this way, the cabin cards will be moved around as you play, and you'll have to use your memory to clear your hand to win.&#10;&#10;There are also tempo chips you can draw for correctly guessing a card you've already dumped. You can use the chips to move the pawn fore or back from the numbered rolled (so it goes to a cabin you remember and want to dump).

Thus, a few pieces of the grid change places each turn, and the cubes slowly go from blank to crosses and circles.

3209;Pennant Race;"Pennant Race is a baseball game that concentrates not on individual games and the pitcher/batter confrontation but on roster management and trading over an entire season.  Real-life players are rated according to their batting average, power, speed and defense over the previous season and those ratings are used to simulate the outcome of a game on a single dice roll.  Over the course of the season, the standings of each club in the league is tracked to see who wins the championship.  Provisions are included in the game for injuries and star performances to occur, and mechanics are included for rookie players to be created.  The game is designed for solitaire play as well as multiple players, and can be used to simulate the background games of a league in tandem with whatever detailed baseball simulation the user prefers.&#10;&#10;";1983;5.628;1.8571;1;12;10;12;Dice, Negotiation, Sports
3210;Hekla;"Hekla is an abstract game, nominally about erupting volcanoes.  Players place and move stones representing various sizes of volcanoes on the board, attempting to create scoring formations.  Scoring creates lava, and once all the lava has been placed the game ends.  In an interesting twist, alignment of your scoring piece on the scoring track with your pieces on the main board allows you to make a special move.&#10;&#10;1st Place 2001 Hippodice Spieleautorenwettbewerb (as DinXX).&#10;&#10;";2001;6.51284;2.4444;2;4;45;10;Abstract Strategy
3211;UFO;"To start the game you arrange twelve UFO cards face up in a circle, with a Planet card inside it. UFO cards are divided in colors and have numbers on them.&#10;The aim of the game is to play UFO cards from your hand in order to win the cards composing the circle. The cards you take score points.&#10;A card played from the hand can be played only on the UFO card in the circle next to the Planet card. Playing a card gives you the possibility of moving the Planet card accordingly to the value of the card played.&#10;UFO cards are played one at a time and the effect produced by each card is resolved before another card can be played (this gives you the possibility of building a strategy).&#10;A card from the circle can be taken only by cards of the same color. Different colors simply take the place of the card on the table.&#10;Simple math can be a valuable asset in sorting out a strategy.&#10;&#10;";2002;4.72727;1.0;2;6;20;6;Card Game

3214;Avalon Hill Game Company's Game of Trivia;"The object of the Avalon Hill Game Company's Game of TRIVIA is to be the first player to answer enough questions to earn a Bachelor's Degree in Trivia. Players start as Freshmen and advance through the rank of Sophomore, Junior, and Senior by correctly answering questions, with each advance in class opening up new paths on the gameboard. Halfway through their journey, players select a &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot; from one of six different &quot;schools&quot; (categories) covering Communications, Science/Technology, Social Sciences, Fine Arts, Health/PhysEd, and the Student Union.

3215;Smart;"Based on information from the publisher's website:&#10;&#10;Smart is about buying, selling and using Smarts in Smartcity. 'Eating' the Smarts determines your emotional situation on the Emotionhead.&#10;&#10;In Smart players struggle to be the best Smartdealer and&#10;to become the owner of three new Smartshops. To do this, players buy, sell and use Smarts in the twelve neighborhoods (gameboard).&#10;&#10;In trading Smarts, you compare the popularity of different types of Smarts in the various neighborhoods, your distance from the neighborhoods in which there is demand for Smarts, the amount of various Smarts others want to  sell and the amount of Euro's others bid on new Smarts.&#10;&#10;Trade is connected to the four actions in every round.&#10;The Smarts you supply but don't sell are the Smarts you 'eat'. This 'eating' influences your emotional situation. How Relaxed, Dull, Hyper and Heavy you are, is indicated on the Emotionhead display. &#10;The corresponding actions can be used to improve your Smarttrade. So it's important to work on your emotional state.  Be careful of partial or even total epileptic attacks.&#10;&#10;Available tactics include good bidding, good selling and good 'eating'. Doing well in one of these gives opportunities to do well in the other two. But sometimes it is important to 'take it easy'.

3219;Demonworld;"Demonworld is a hybrid miniatures and hex style wargame. The basic game comes with a 140 page rulebook, reference sheets, unit recruitment cards, 4 hex maps, and card stock counters representing a small orc and human (Empire) army.  The maps are generic terrain maps with light woods and small hills.  They may be combined in different ways to create different battlefields.  If you enjoy the game you can invest more money in it by purchasing the different 15mm regiment packs.  The game supports several races typical of the fantasy genre (elves, dwarves, orcs, dark elves) and adds a few unique ones as well (Thain[Norse], Isthak [chaos-like]).  The regiments generally consist of 8 to 10 counters.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:  Players are free to set their objectives for each battle, though some simple scenarios are provided to get you started.  Players spend points to add regiments for their armies.  Armies are set up on the edge of the mapboard and maneuvered to contact.  Orders are selected for each unit for each turn indicating whether it will skirmish (move and fire), attack (move to contact), move (move long distance), or hold (defend and fire at incoming attackers if missile equipped).  Use of ordered formations help a unit fight and move.  Combat bonuses are given to units who are able to hit their target in the flank or rear, use terrain to advantage, and use weapons that confer advantage in special cases (ie lance from a charging knight).  Morale rules determine whether a unit is going to hold their position, rout, or in some cases become 'impetuous' and aggressively continue an attack without orders to do so.&#10;&#10;As a player you assume the role of General of an army.   &#10;The game begins by recruiting an army. Each army is made up of several units. A unit is a group of soldiers who fight together in an organized fashion. Most units have 40 foot troops or 20 mounted models on ten individual hex bases. Sometimes a unit might be a single large creature like a dragon or war machine such as a catapult. Every unit has a points value and when you create an Army, both players will have an agreed upon amount of points to spend to create their army. This is most often 1200 points, the amount used for tournament play. For your army you may also want to recruit special heroes, commanders or wizards. Every unit in the Demonworld game has its own recruiting card which is included in the army book. These handy little cards make recruiting an army easy because they include all the information about a unit including its points cost.&#10;&#10;Once both players have spent all their points and created their army, it is time to create the battlefield. Demonworld is played on a large flat surface like a table. This could be a kitchen, dining room, or work table or even the floor. The Demonworld game is great because the battlefield consists of four or more of the Demonworld maps. You can also augment the maps with model trees, buildings or hills. This is not really necessary however, because the maps look great. Using the maps makes setting up a game really fast. Four of these maps are provided with the basic game. If you would like more variety several additional map sets are available.&#10;&#10;Once the maps are laid out each player will deploy their units on the battlefield. Where you place your units is crucial to the success of your army. Try to take advantage of the terrain. This could mean creating an ambush by hiding a unit in the woods. Or putting a unit on a hill where your opponent will have to fight uphill to attack them. If you can, also try to imagine what your opponent will do and then you may be able to set a trap for them or otherwise create a plan to defeat them.&#10;&#10;Once both armies are deployed (put on the table) play begins. Demonworld uses a simultaneous turn sequence. In each turn both players will have an opportunity to move all of their units and shoot missile weapons like bows, engage in hand to hand combat, or cast spells. The rules on how to perform these actions are in the Demonworld rule book. The army books have extra rules for special units which only that army may recruit and special spells which only that army can cast. As the turns progress each player will try to move their units to a position of advantage and eliminate the opponents units. Sometimes people play a game with a specific set of objectives. These games are called scenarios. In scenarios achieving your objectives is often more important than destroying your opponents army or preventing your own losses. Once one side has achieved its objectives or destroyed the opposing army, they are the winner and the game is over. Most games take about three hours. Experienced players play much faster than novices and can handle larger armies.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;";1999;6.83909;4.2;2;6;120;12;Adventure, Fantasy, Medieval, Miniatures, Wargame

Players other than the direct neighbors could only be reached by traveling through the neighbors or the center.&#10;&#10;Included in the game are 6 domestic army pawns for each player, 36 mercenary pawns, 12 ambassador cards, 6 lady cards, 50 coins and 2 dice. At the beginning, each player receives the 6 domestic army pawns, 1 lady, 2 ambassadors and 3 coins.&#10;&#10;Combats are resolved without random chance by simple calculation of the difference between the number of pawns. &#10;Income is provided to the player on the basis of the number of spaces occupied by a single domestic pawn. Each player may offer alliance to any player and if accepted, ambassadors are exchanged. Alliance permits joint attacks and unlike some other games, alliances are law: allies absolutely cannot attack one another.&#10;&#10;";1982;6.7;2.3333;4;6;180;13;Economic, Negotiation, Renaissance

Each player then chooses a role. When competing for the crystals later, each player may only play cards for his or her role (suit) or wild cards. Before that, however, players negotiate to form teams, which can involve secret or open negotiations, revealing cards, etc. Once formed, alliance members may freely swap cards amongst themselves.&#10;&#10;Players then play cards, with the alliance that plays the highest total value winning the crystals. However, the choicest crystals are given to this turns' highest-ranking player, not necessarily the player who played the most/strongest cards.

3263;Ukraine '43: The Soviet Summer Offensive Against Army Group South;"On August 3rd, 1943, less than two weeks after the Kursk offensive, the Soviets launched a massive offensive near Kharkov that ripped open the German line. The ensuing battle began their summer offensive that would take them across the Ukraine to the Dnieper River.&#10;During August the two sides were equally matched and a tremendous war of attrition raged from Kharkov to the Sea of Azov with neither side willing to give ground. In September, bled white by the never-ending Soviet attacks, the German army retreated in haste to the safety of the Dnieper River. In October, the battle raged along the length of the Dnieper and for the Perekop Peninsula, the only land exit to the German 17th Army in the Crimea. During this three month period German reinforcements poured in from every sector, but it was never enough. Three Soviet Tank Armies and four Soviet Fronts ground through nineteen panzer and panzergrenadier divisions. German and Soviet losses were staggering. Kiev, the capital of the Ukraine, fell on November 6th.&#10;&#10;&#10;[1st edition]&#10;&#10;Ukraine '43 attempts to simulate this important campaign in a moderately complex game. The design uses the conventional move-fight-exploit sequence of play and the popular Zone of Control Bond rules. Soviet tank armies and German panzer corps spearhead constant attacks and counterattacks. With both sides able to attack, the game becomes a tense battle of skill and nerves.&#10; Game Features:&#10;&#10;        German Panzer Corps/Russian Tank Army capabilities&#10;        Soviet massed artillery&#10;        German tactical proficiency&#10;        German Tiger tanks&#10;        Soviet sappers&#10;        air power&#10;        differing capabilities for Marshal Zhukov and General Manstein&#10;        Zone of Control Bonds &#10;&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS (1st edition)&#10;&#10;    280 1/2&quot; full-color counters&#10;    One One 22x29&quot; full-color mapsheet and one 5x29&quot; full-color mapsheet which form a 26.75 x 29&rdquo; map&#10;    32-page Rule Book&#10;    2 full-color 11x17 Player Aid Cards&#10;    1 8.5x11 Sequence of Play Card (w/ Historical Setup on the reverse side!)&#10;    Three 6-sided dice &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;[2nd Edition]The 2nd Edition has been re-designed to play much faster using the system used in France '40 and Normandy '44.

3265;NUTS! The Battle of the Bulge Card Game;"&quot;NUTS! The Battle of the Bulge&quot; is a card wargame for 2-4 players recreating the famous World War II battle in which the German Army mounted a surprise attack on the thin U.S. forces deployed in the Ardennes region, hoping to break through to the English Channel and split the Allied Forces.  Each player controls either the German or the U.S. and British forces.  Players draw cards in each daily turn from their own decks, then play the cards as they see fit.  Many cards can be played during the opponent's turn so there is constant interaction.  Each deck is complete; there are no cards to collect or trade.  NUTS! comes in two 150-card sets (North and South).  Each set is complete and can be played on its own, or the two sets can be played together.  (From the back of the box by Decision Games)&#10;&#10;The cards have actual photographs of units, events, cities, and equipment from the battle.  Cards comprise of units (infantry, artillery, mechanized), events like bad weather or supply drops, and terrain to include cities, major forest, rivers, and ridges.  Units are rated in strength values for infantry, armor, artillery, and cohesion.  The objectives are for the Germans to get three panzer units (six if playing both decks) from their start side off the Allied side of the board.  The Allies must prevent this and stall the offensive until adequate reinforcement arrival.  Although this is a card game, it plays very much like a board game.  Battles are resolved via dice rolling.  The rules do include important factors such as supply, town encirclement, weather, blitzes, cohesion checks, and the like.  Overall, an easy to medium game to grasp the rules and play.  (comments by Walt Mulder)&#10;&#10;";1998;6.03182;2.5385;2;4;120;0;Card Game, Wargame, World War II
3267;Pizarro & Co.;"Players are kings (or queens) bidding for the services of six famous explorers -- Ferdinand Magellan, Christopher Columbus, Francisco Pizarro, Vasco da Gama, James Cook, and Marco Polo. As the game progresses, competition for the explorers' services increases as each explorer has fewer expeditions available for investment. In the end, only one ship for each explorer makes the final trip and only one king earns those rewards.&#10;&#10;Firstly, the board is set up from two double-sided boards, giving four possible configurations with slightly different versions of each explorer. Each player has six ships and money cards numbered 1 to 9. There are three turns. In the first, each explorer has 3 ships, but only two of these will proceed to the second turn and only one will win through to the third.&#10;&#10;A set of cards with explorers is used for each turn - 3 of each explorer in turn one, 2 of each in turn two and 1 of each in the last turn. The top card is revealed and an auction held, going round the table until all but one player has passed. The winning bidder puts the card in front of them and places one of their ships on to the relevant explorer area on the board. This process is repeated until all the cards have been bid on.&#10;&#10;Each explorer has a different power, some giving victory points, others money or a special ability like being able to delay a subsequent auction, or a combination of these. At the end of a turn players gain two new money cards, plus any which explorers they have a ship on give them. The second turn work in the same way, but only players with a ship invested in an explorer can bid on it, and because there are only two ships of the three on each explorer moving to the second area, one will be left behind. Similarly, the third round sees just one ship of the remaining two move to the third and final area for each explorer. Scoring is then done, with more points available for players with ships reaching the third area.&#10;&#10;Money is always tight so it is a good idea to try and get some extra income, though this conflicts with the need to score points. Two of the explorers score a lot of points but have no income so each player must balance the two needs. Money cards are worth points as well, so there is also a trade off between using these to win auctions to advance your ships and keeping them to score with.&#10;&#10;";2002;6.5077;2.446;3;6;45;12;Exploration, Renaissance

3273;Cat Attack;"Cat Attack, suitable for two to six players, aged 8 years and over and made entirely in the EU. The game has been designed with the fun strategy player in mind. Playing time 40 - 180+ mins depending on the number of players.&#10;&#10;The game Cat Attack is based on the trials and tribulations of the domestic cat. The board represents a local neighborhood. Each player is a (model) cat that lives in its own house. To win the game a cat must fill its larder with six items of food. There is milk at the Dairy, vitamins at the Vet, fish from the Fishmonger and a tin of cat food from the corner shop. There are also (model) birds and mice, which the cats have to catch. Of course, each cat begins the game with nine lives; any cat that loses all of its nine lives is out of the game. Players are dealt a hand of Mog cards; these and a die provide the means to move the cats, birds and mice. The players can choose to move their cats along garden walls or paths or, the more adventurous can travel round the road, this route is a lot quicker but there is a car. Cats can raid other cats larders and attack one another. A pack of Curiosity cards dictate, at random, when the shops open and close and movements of the (model) car. A Curiosity card is picked up when a cat lands on a Curiosity square. Some of these cards are good news but you know what happened to the curious cat!&#10;&#10;";2002;5.50095;1.6923;2;6;120;10;Adventure, Fighting, Party Game

As the player tokens go around the board, their starting money eventually dwindles to nothing, at which point they no longer receive nor pay out money (ignoring the instructions on most of the board spaces) and exclusively draw from the Welfare fund (a separate pile of money) each turn they go around the board.  The game continues until the Welfare is exhausted, and the winner is then the player who got the most Welfare.&#10;&#10;";1980;4.33333;0.0;2;6;60;0;Economic, Political

Similar to Magic: The Gathering in many ways, except there are no &quot;lands&quot; or similar methods of generating magical power.  Instead, players siphon power from their Magi or their monsters to perform attacks or put cards into play, thus controlling just how many powerful cards a player can attempt to unleash in a single turn. (in essence, you must sacrifice your own creatures to fuel more powerful attacks and techniques).  The game was meant to target an audience of those that felt Pokemon was too much a kids game, but not ready to jump into the highly competitive (and 'older' target audience) of Magic: The Gathering.  The concept also spawned a not-so-successful cartoon series and Game Boy Color video game.  Starter decks include all the required counters, a six-sided die, quick reference player aids, and a play mat.&#10;&#10;";2000;7.05856;2.7273;2;4;60;10;Card Game, Collectible Components, Fantasy

A mix of cards and dice and symbols.&#10;&#10;The Druids start from the Grove, in the centre of the Stone Circle. When a player begins his turn, he must move his druid, firstly, onto one of the 6 stones showing a Pentagram. This is the only space that may be moved to, from the centre area. The player throws both dice. At the beginning of the game each player has only one piece available (his Druid), therefore only one of the dice is used to determine movement. The second dice is unused until such time as the player has other game-pieces available for him to move. The meaning of the symbols on the dice dictate the type of movement allowed.&#10;The space on which a Druid lands also affects further events. After the player has carried out all necessary actions then his turn is over. If a Druid lands on a blank stone then his turn is immediately ended and play passes to the next player.&#10; Once a player has taken control of two or more pieces then he may apply the dice to their full potential. In this case a player can, for example, move two Spirits or one Spirit and one Druid. Naturally he will choose the optimum moves, considering the symbols on the stones and the location of other game pieces, which each piece can land on.&#10;The player with the most points, overall, wins the game and is proclaimed the new High-Druid.&#10;&#10;";1995;5.16786;2.0;2;5;45;10;Ancient, Fantasy

3307;Wallenstein;"Historically, Albrecht von Wallenstein, duke of Friedland and Mecklenburg, was one of the most important mercenary commanders of the Imperial army during the Thirty Years' War (1618-48). His overweening ambition was to head a large central European empire, which got him dismissed in 1630. Such was his power, however, that the empire was forced to reinstate him when Sweden came into the fray. He recovered Bohemia, but was defeated by Gustavus Adolphus at L&uuml;tzen, and was again dismissed. His subsequent intrigues with Protestant forces alarmed the Catholic princes who were probably complicit in his assassination in 1634 by Irish mercenaries at Eger, Bohemia.&#10;&#10;The game begins with the start of the war, each player controlling several countries. Player actions include the conquest of new countries, tax collection, erection of buildings (i.e. development of the economy), feeding the populace, victualing the army, etc. Some actions increase the chance for unrest, and expensive rebellions can occur. The strongest power at the end wins.&#10;&#10;Employs the cube tower included in the publisher's previous game, Im Zeichen des Kreuzes.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Shogun&#10;    Wallenstein (Second Edition)&#10;&#10;&#10;";2002;7.45803;3.303;3;5;150;12;Economic, Pike and Shot, Territory Building, Wargame

3312;1776: The Game of the American Revolutionary War;"1776 is a two-player, turn-based war game played on a hex grid map of the thirteen colonies and Canada.  It is primarily concerned with the military aspects of the American Revolutionary War. There is a basic game, various scenarios with advanced rules and a campaign game.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill Complexity Rating - 7&#10;&#10;&#10;(from the back of the box:)&#10;&#10;The shot heard round the world at Lexington set off more than just another brushfire war in England's scattered dominions. It gave birth to a struggling new nation led by a comparative handful of patriots whose refusal to bow before tyranny set the tone for an American heritage preserved from defeat to this very day. But victory did not come cheap. &#10;After showing the British the color of their mettle at Bunker Hill, Washington's little army was plagued by one defeat after another, shunting from one battlefield to the next; always beaten but never destroyed. No power of the period believed that the upstart colonials and their unborn nation had the slightest chance of emerging victorious against the strongest military machine of the era after the dismal summer of 1776. But then came the cruelest winter of the decade when even nature seemed to join forces with the British against the tattered American troops. Undaunted, Washington led his small force in the historic crossing of the Delaware to twice surprise and rout British forces at Trenton and Princeton. Their resolve thus strengthened, the ill-clad Americans retired to Valley Forge to face winter beset by the hunger and deprivation that cost the lives of 2500 patriots. But the coming spring found Clinton facing a revitalized and strengthened rebel army which proceeded to chase him across New Jersey in the Monmouth Campaign. Reassured by news of the French alliance and the great American victory at Saratoga that fall, American troops dug in for what they knew would be a long and bitter battle for independence.&#10;&#10;6 Games in One Package - Each a Realistic Simulation of the War for Independence...&#10;&#10;1776, like all Avalon Hill games, is more than just the standard roll the dice and move game. It is a realistic simulation of the strategic situation faced by British and American alike in that fiery decade when the United States won its independence. &#10;Actually, 1776 is six games in one: a Basic Game that gets you quickly and easily into the routine of simulation gaming; an Advanced Game with scenarios that provides additional complexity and realism; and a Campaign Simulation Game that encompasses the entire war and balances successes in one region against failures in another - truly the ultimate in a simulation gaming experience! &#10;And if you don't have the time for a complete Campaign Game, there are four scenarios to choose from; each of which poses a challenge for everyone; from the most erudite of military historians to the fellow who just managed to pass American History:&#10;&#10;Scenario 1: The Invasion of Canada - 1775 to 1776 - Can YOU do better than the bumbling General Schuyler and Benedict Arnold in the vain American atttempt to make Canada a 14th colony?&#10;&#10;Scenario 2: The Saratoga Campaign - 1777 - Can YOU as General Horatio Gates surround and destroy the forces of the British General Burgoyne in this reinactment of the turning point of the Revolution?&#10;&#10;Scenario 3: Greene's Southern Campaignv - 1780 to 1781 - Can YOU as General Nathaniel Greene lead Cornwallis' tested regulars on a merry chase with your force of rag-tag militia and Guerilla bands without being crushed in a major engagement?&#10;&#10;Scenario 4: The Yorktown Campaign - 1781 - Can you duplicate Washington's encirclement and crushing defeat of Cornwallis in the battle that won the Revolution?&#10;&#10;Contents: &#10;&#10;     a 16&quot; x 44&quot; four-section, full color mapboard depicting colonial America from Quebec to Georgia; &#10;     two sets of die-cut troop counters representing over 400 units of Continentals, British Regulars, Rebel and Tory Militia, French Regulars, Indians, and naval units of the British and French fleets; &#10;     1 die; &#10;     1 Terrain Effects Chart; &#10;     2 sets (8 per set) of Tactical Combat Cards used in the innovative, new Sustained Combat system; 1 set of scenario, CRT, and play chart cards organized on an index-card format that puts a summary of all levels of the game at your fingertips; &#10;     a 32-page Rules &amp; Designers' Notes Manual telling you how to play all 6 game versions plus the inside story on research and development and why the game was designed the way it was.&#10;&#10;&#10;Rated &quot;Tournament Level&quot; on Avalon Hill's Simulation-complexity scale.&#10;&#10;";1974;6.53362;3.0987;2;2;120;12;Age of Reason, American Indian Wars, American Revolutionary War, Wargame
3313;Traverse;"Traverse is played on a square &quot;checker&quot; game board with a 12 1/2&quot; x 12 1/2&quot; grid. Each player chooses one color of playing pieces. Each player has eight pieces of the same color: 2 squares, 2 diamonds, 2 triangles, and 2 circles. Each player arranges their pieces in ANY ORDER within their starting row. The object of the game is to get ALL of your pieces into the starting row of the player sitting opposite of you. The pieces move in different directions depending upon the shape:&#10;&#10;    Squares can move horizontally and vertically. &#10;    Diamonds can move only diagonally. &#10;    Triangles can move forward on the diagonals or straight backwards. &#10;    Circles can move in any direction. &#10;&#10;&#10;Players take turns moving one piece each turn. Two pieces can not occupy the same space. Pieces can move in single space moves, one space at a time and only into an empty adjacent space as dictated by the piece's legal moves. Players can jump over their own or another player's piece. Jumped pieces are NOT captured, akin to Chinese Checkers. Players can string together a series of jumps if each individual jump in the series conforms to the rules governing single jumps. The first player to move all of their pieces into the destination row is the winner. Players can not force a draw.&#10;&#10;Listed on &quot;GAMES 100&quot; GAMES Magazine&#10;1992 Mensa Select&#10;&#10;2-4 players ages 7 to adult&#10;&#10;";1987;5.99966;1.9688;2;4;30;7;Abstract Strategy

3321;Die Pyramiden des Jaguar;"Players build a pyramid using 40 numbered cards, taking care to construct the pyramid with the lowest value card at the bottom left, and the highest at the top.

Cards already on a pyramid can be covered once (after that they are covered by a jaguar stone), an action that triggers movement along the jungle path (scoring track). Certain steps on the path also contain events that can alter construction of the pyramids. The person who completes their pyramid first gets extra steps along the path. The round ends when a player has completed his pyramid, has only one or zero cards left in hand or when either player cannot legally play a card.

3339;Diceland: Deep White Sea;"James Ernest once again stakes out some uncharted game design territory with Diceland: Deep White Sea.  The game consists of five sets of octahedral stiff paper dice, about 2&quot; per edge, with five team members per set.  These dice have full-color comic-book style artwork by Eduardo Muller and game information printed on each face, and each die represents a character. Each die is pre-cut and scored, and assembles easily with just tabs and slots.  Despite being made from &quot;mere paper,&quot; the dice are surprisingly sturdy, and the use of a good quality card stock means they tend to stay in good condition. Unless you accidentally sit on one, of course.&#10;&#10;The basic goal is to be the first person to reach 50 points, which are earned by &quot;killing&quot; your opponent's characters.  Each turn, you may throw a new character into the arena (if you have any available to throw), have one of your characters use his or her action or power, or have one of your characters move.  Movement is done by rotating a die onto a new face on the table.  If you throw a new character into play, he or she may immediately use his or her power on the side that lands face up. Available powers may be an attack or a special action. Some of the special actions allow you to, in turn, use the powers of other teammates, triggering a cascading reaction across the table.&#10;&#10;Attacking is simple: Each attack has a power rating.  If it exceeds the block rating of the defending dice, the defending dice is killed, and the attacker scores its points (printed on side one of each die).  If it is equal or less than the defense value, the defending die is merely moved so that a lower value face is face-up, unless it's been &quot;wounded&quot; so many times that it's already on its lowest face, in which case, it dies.&#10;&#10;A basic game of Diceland lasts about 20 minutes.&#10;&#10;List of Diceland sets and armies&#10;&#10;";2002;6.42364;1.92;2;5;20;10;Action / Dexterity, Collectible Components, Dice, Fantasy, Fighting, Science Fiction

The game requires you to supply the playing surface (the rules are designed for either a hex field or a completely free form field) and the dice (which ideally should read 0-5 instead of 1-6). The counters are supplied on a laminated piece of paper roughly the same quality as the cover of the book, you must cut them out.&#10;&#10;Each turn begins with each player secretly marking down how much thrust they are applying to which thrusters on their ships. These are simultaneously revealed, and thrust markers are added/removed as needed. Because space is a vacuum, thrust applied in one direction will mean you go in that direction until you compensate for it!&#10;&#10;The next part of the turn is the combat phase. Players must roll the dice to determine if they can still see their opponent. If they can see their enemy can they shoot. All the players fire their weapons simultaneously, and then they apply the results of hits and criticals at the same time. The turn is now complete.&#10;&#10;There are significant technological differences between the American and German spacecraft. The German craft are generally more powerful, but have a limited supply of fuel and weapons, while the American craft are weaker, but their fuel and weapons supply automatically recharges each turn.&#10;&#10;Hard Vacuum is aimed at any fan of classic sci-fi, dogfight, or space combat games. It has a lighter, almost comic book quality in its setting and the game does not get bogged down by complex rules or mechanics. Once the game mechanics are mastered (which does not take long), a complete game can be played in under an hour.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;     Hard Vacuum: Science Gone Mad&#10;     Hard Vacuum: War's End&#10;&#10;&#10;";2000;7.37143;2.625;2;8;45;12;Science Fiction, Wargame, World War II
3341;Burn Rate;"BURN RATE puts the players in the role of a dot-com CEO, trying to keep his startup afloat.  The challenge of the game is to keep a startup in business and lose money as slowly as possible.  Opponents try to force each other to flame out quickly with money-wasting dot-com projects, over hiring, and incompetent vice presidents.&#10;&#10;The mechanics of the game are based on real life.  A player's employee [cards] each has a skill number, and that skill allows the play of cards that represent their actions.  For example, a FUNDING card with a skill prerequisite of 2 requires an Finance employee with a minimum skill of 2 to play it.&#10;&#10;A player's bank account is debited each turn based on his current situation, or &quot;burn rate&quot;.  A player wins when all the others have run out of money.&#10;&#10;";2002;6.09173;1.569;2;4;45;13;Card Game

3346;Sea-Life;"This is an underwater game for two to six players.&#10;Each player has his own deck which consists of marine life and a fisherman.&#10;Each marine life card has a set of stripes that allow players to know which fish can eat which.&#10;A board is created using food(prey) cards.The board consists of prey giving either possitive or negative points.&#10;The food cards are shuffled and placed in a stack in the middle of the table. Each player draws eight Food cards and adds them to his hand. &#10;The starting player begins and sets a card face down in the middle of the table. In turn then the other players follow in clockwise and insert their card played face down on the left of the previous card. This generates a hidden row of cards. &#10;During the second phase of the game, the first player begins again and sets this time one of his cards to food underneath a hidden playing card.&#10;A food card must not be discarded under our own card. EAch player does the same until we have two complete rows with hidden cards on the table.&#10;The next phase is scoring.The map tiles are successively uncovered, without changing their position. Initially the food map is resolved &#10;When all cards have been detected and analyzed, they come back in the box. The game continues anti-clockwise. &#10;Once all hole cards have been played and scored, the game ends. The player with the highest total wins.&#10;&#10;";1997;5.32143;1.0;2;6;20;10;Card Game

3348;Santa Fe Rails;"On a map showing the western portion of the United States, each player takes turns building track to extend any of five major railroad lines westward from their originating cities.  Players often want the lines to extend in different directions toward the cities that they have a stake in. Some branching is allowed, but each line has a limited number of track pieces.&#10; Stakes for specific cities are accumulated throughout the game by drawing blind from a deck of city cards.  The more different lines arriving at a city, the higher the score will be for that city.  Later in the game, four short lines also become available.&#10;&#10;An updated version of Alan R. Moon's White Wind game Santa Fe.&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;The deck is composed of city cards (with some short lines shuffled into the middle third). Players have a hand of 4 city cards to start the game. Each round, players simultaneously select a card to play, then reveal. City cards are added to your personal display -- essentially, you have a share in that city. There are also several special cards (2x, 3x, 4-in-one, Branch Line, Boomtown) that modify the basic game turn. These specials are on public display, and can be acquired at the end of each round (some cost $1; the 2x may be held, but the rest must be played immediately after acquiring them).&#10;&#10;Then, in turn order, going twice around, players add a single track to any of the railheads (each of the 5 lines has specific starting locations on the board). If the link is to a previously unconnected city, collect $2. In addition, if the city is one of the goal cities of that train line, collect $4.&#10;&#10;After all players have gone (twice), pass the start player marker to the left. THEN, in turn order, players bring their hand total back to 4 (draw from deck and/or from cards on display). If a Short Line card is revealed, discard the card and draw again; that Short Line is now in play. They choose a card to play, and repeat above.&#10;&#10;The game ends when tracks for 3 lines are completely used. Each city's value is equal to its base value, printed on board, multiplied by the number of different train lines connected to it. The player with the most cash and city value wins!&#10;&#10;";2001;6.79856;2.51;2;5;60;12;Trains
3349;Die Safeknacker;"In this card driven game, safe-crackers co-operate but must share the spoils.  The player who finishes the game with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;Everyone has two choices in their turn: either recruit safe-crackers or attempt to crack a safe. One of these two must be chosen every turn.&#10;&#10;The first choice is to take one of your own safe-crackers and put him on any of another player. Put this safe-cracker in that team before you. This way you can build safe-cracker teams in addition to individual safe-crackers. The piece lying on top shows who has the safe-cracking team under their control.&#10;&#10;The second choice is to crack the safe. First a gaze at the safe cards: On each safe card, a value that this safe contains is printed - the loot. Simultaneously it also portrays how large the safe-cracking team must be in order to crack this safe; the team may also be bigger. Place the team on the desired safe, dismantle it and share the loot.&#10;The card with the cracked safe is set aside and a new safe card is uncovered.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all the safes are cracked.

3351;Wer ist der Täter?;"Wanted. There are 48 suspects for the murder, can you reveal the killer?&#10;&#10;The game has 48 cards showing combinations of old/young/man/women, in 4 colors, with different murder weapons. One player shuffles the cards and takes the top card without revealing it to the other players. This is the perpetrator. Now he takes the next card and places it face-up on the table. He compares it to the perpetrator-card.&#10;If one the features (old/young/man/woman/poison/dagger/gun/blue/green/yellow/brown) matches the perpetrator-card he says that the person on that card is suspicious. If none of the features match he says that the person on the card is innocent.&#10;This continues until a player thinks he knows who is the perpetrator. If the accuser is wrong, he may not guess again until another player succesfully accuses the right perpetrator. This player scores 1 point.&#10;Now the next player shuffles the cards and picks a perpetrator and a new round starts. If all players started a new round, the game ends and the player with most points wins. In case of a tie, one additional round is played with the tied players.&#10;&#10;Players take turn calling and the winner is the best detective.&#10;&#10;";1989;5.67073;1.2;2;12;20;10;Card Game, Deduction, Murder / Mystery

3353;WW2: Barbarossa to Berlin;"(from GMT Games:)&#10;&#10;Spring 1941: Nazi Germany is triumphant. Poland has long since vanished from the map. Denmark, Norway, and the Low Countries have been overrun. France, the victor of 1918, has fallen. Greece and Yugoslavia have now been crushed. Britain stands alone, freed from the threat of invasion by the courage and skill of its air force and navy. But Britain is stalked and assaulted by the Nazi wolfpacks, and in North Africa a mixed garrison of British and Commonwealth forces is besieged in Tobruk by Rommel and his Afrika Korps.&#10;&#10;Then, on June 22, Hitler launches Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of Stalin's Soviet Union. As the panzer spearheads slice through the bewildered Russian defenders, it appears that nothing can halt the Nazi tide. But the course of History has just taken a major turn. The Last European War is over; World War II has begun. It will end four years later, in a bunker in the ruins of Berlin.&#10;&#10;World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin covers those four years of epic struggle, from Moscow to Stalingrad, from Tobruk to Tunis, from Sicily to Rome, from D-Day to the Rhine, to the final battles for the Reich. Designed by Ted Raicer as a follow-up to his award-winning WWI strategic game, Paths of Glory, World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin modifies the Paths of Glory systems to capture the strategic and operational dynamics of WWII in Europe.&#10;&#10;As in Paths of Glory, World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin uses a point to point map, this time covering all of Europe from France to the Urals, and from Norway to North Africa. Units are armies and corps (fronts and armies for the Soviets), and each turn represents three months. The movement and combat systems will be familiar to Paths of Glory players, but have been modified to recreate the blitzkrieg campaigns of 1941-45.&#10;&#10;As in Paths of Glory, the heart of the game lies in the 110 Action Cards (55 each for the Axis and Allied players). Each card can be used for operational movement and combat, strategic movement, replacements, or for an Event. Events include:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Individual leaders (Patton, Guderian, or Rommel the Desert Fox) &#10;    Tactical innovations and new weapons (Fortified boxes, Tiger tanks) &#10;    Strategic Warfare (U-boats, Bomber Command, the 8th Airforce) &#10;    Reinforcements (Soviet Mechanized Fronts, PanzerArmee Afrika, Patton's Third Army) &#10;    Allied Invasions, actual or potential (Torch, Sledgehammer, Husky, Overlord) &#10;    Politics and Diplomacy (Hitler Declares War, Casablanca, Yalta, Operation Axis) &#10;    Irregular Warfare (Partisans, the Maquis, Otto Skorzeny)&#10;&#10;&#10;World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin presents both the Allied and Axis players with a wide range of exciting game choices, while illustrating the key historical factors of the war; from the importance of mechanized forces in combat to the importance of oil to fuel them, but without the complexity of other strategic WWII designs. And unlike many of those games, World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin lives up to its title: an Axis player who fails to win the war may still win the game. The winner is often decided on the last turn as the Allied player struggles to extinguish the last traces of the Nazi empire.&#10;&#10;It is June 22, 1941: Will WWII end in German triumph in Barbarossa or collapse in Berlin? As the world holds its breath, the decisions are yours.&#10;&#10;";2002;7.28895;3.5294;1;2;420;14;Wargame, World War II

3359;Anagrams;"Anagrams is a game where players reveal letter tiles one at a time, claiming any word as soon as they can make it. Once a word is in front of someone, other players may steal it by making an anagram of it which introduces other letters from the pool.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented as Snatch and Scrabble Scoring Anagrams. Published during the same time frame as the 1877 Word Making and Taking. A version of this game using the word &ldquo;anagram&rdquo; in its title was published by Thomas Whittaker in New York on or before 1875 and was called &ldquo;The Game of Anagrams&rdquo;. With Parker Brothers and McLoughlin Brothers both releasing Anagrams games in 1890, this likely reflects the expiry of the 17 year patent period that existed at the time.&#10;&#10;&#10;Many editions of the game have been sold and exact rules vary, but one version runs as follows:&#10;&#10;The players shuffle the letters in the &quot;pool&quot; thoroughly. Each player, in turn, draws a letter tile from the pool and places it face up on the table. These letters are available to all players on their turn.&#10;&#10;Before starting play it should be decided that either 3-letter, 4-letter or 5-letter words are to be established as the basis of play.&#10;&#10;Then the first player draws a letter from the pool. Keeping it hidden, he tries to form one word of 2 or more letters with the letter in his hand and with at least one or more of those letters face up on the table. He may also form the word with only the face up letters and not use the letter in his hand. Whenever a player forms a word, his turn ends.&#10;&#10;If a player cannot form a word, or if he forms one but doesn't use the letter he has drawn from the pool, he must discard this letter at the end of his turn. The letter is discarded by putting it face up with the other turned up letters on the table. Then the next player moves.&#10;&#10;When a player forms a word, he places it in front of him facing it to the center of the table. This is done so the other players can easily see it. It gives them the chance to steal words. As the game continues and players gather words, they may steal the words from one another. This is done by taking all the letters of another player's word and adding one or more letters to it to completely change that word's meaning. The letters added to a word in &quot;stealing&quot; may be the one drawn by the player from the pool or one or more of those face up.&#10;&#10;Adding S to make a word plural (or ED or ING) does not change the meaning of a word and cannot be used to &quot;steal&quot; a word. Any letters at all, however, can be used in &quot;stealing&quot; a word if the new word formed is entirely changed in meaning.&#10;&#10;Players should make their own words harder to steal by adding letters to them and making them more complex. This counts as a complete turn and is as important as forming new words.&#10;&#10;When all of the tiles have been drawn from the pool, players, continue in turn to try to form words using the face up letters. The game ends when there are no more face up letters, or when no player is able to move using the remaining face up letters. Each player counts the number of tiles in all of the words he has formed in front of him.&#10;&#10;The winner is the person who has first obtained eight (8) words. The game is not over until ALL players have had an EQUAL number of turns.&#10;&#10;If at the end of an equal number of turns there is more than one player with eight (8) words, count the number of tiles in those 8 words. The player with the most tiles wins. If the number of tiles in the 8 words is equal, then the game ends in a tie.&#10;&#10;";1875;6.75507;2.0;2;6;45;8;Children's Game, Word Game

As soon as one player reaches 100 points, the game ends and the player with the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;The player at the left of the dealer starts by placing any word of not less than two or more than four letters in the center of the table, naming the words as they play it. After the first player, all following must play to the words already formed on the table.

3362;Fast Freddy's Hong Kong Dice Game;"There are 6 special dice, red, white and blue chips, score pads, and a very nice dice cup. A die has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 pips on one side. All the other sides of the dice are blank. Well, that's not exactly true ... The 2 pip die has a Red Dragon on the face opposite the 2 pips. So, we have 36 sides, but only 7 of the sides have pips and the Red Dragon. Each player starts with 20 points worth of chips. (White = 1 point, Red = 5 points, and Blue = 10 points) Play begins with each player putting 5 points in the pot. On your turn, roll the dice and count the pips. The player then takes that many points out of the pot. If there are not enough points in the pot, then the player adds points to the pot until the pot equals the numbers of pips rolled. There are special payment and rewards for rolling all blanks and for when the Red Dragon is rolled. The first time any player does not have enough points to pay the pot, the set has ended.

3373;San Gimignano;"San Gimignano uses large hex tiles as a board, each showing three areas with one of four different colors.  A start set of tiles are laid such that no color touches itself on an adjacent tile.  Through the game, tiles are added to the board by the players with this same restriction.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you add a marker to claim one of the colored spots on the board; up to two markers can be placed on a space.  When you have four adjacent markers that are all on different colors, you can place a tower. Once the tower is placed, this spot is no longer usable for any other marker connections. The game ends when no more towers can be placed or when someone manages to place all 10 of their towers.  The player with the most placed towers wins.&#10;&#10;Tile placement and marker placement are both critical, as is where to place your tower so that you don't shut off further growth options.  It is possible to end up with a bunch of uselessly placed markers once all four colors will not be available to any of them.

For each attempt a chip is paid, when the Guesser gets it correct, the Reader scores the chips paid, the Guesser scores the remainder. So getting it correct early scores you loads, getting it late scores the Reader loads.

The theme of the game is that you are investors in various comically named inventions. The game has a very curious mechanism that does double duty for rolling the dice and applying Patent Claim clips. (The kids love fussing with it.)&#10;&#10;The game board has an outside track, the Invention Track, and an inside track, the Royalty Track. On the Invention Track is where you pick up the various inventions (like buying properties in Monopoly). Instead of building house and hotels, you get a Patent Claim Clip attached to the invention card. This patent clip has a 0, 1, or 2 on it. The number assigned is random. The higher patent clip number, the more your patent makes you come royalty collection time. Eureka Cards can also be played that allow you to do special actions during your turn.

The board in the English-only version is thin cardboard which fan-folds into a wedge. (The English/French version uses a more traditional gameboard, and has a longer box to accommodate it.)&#10;&#10;There is a production error in the tokens in the English-only version; you'll need to add markings to some of the tokens if 5 or 6 people are playing.

3383;Mahé;"In Die Heisse Schlacht am Kalten Buffet, alternatively released as Kangaroo and Generalowsky, players try to win prize cards from the limited number available to them &mdash; but to win they must lap a circular track that (typically) consists of 21 spaces, and not only must they circle the track, but they have to do so while being top dog, so to speak.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player rolls 1-3 six-sided dice to determine whether she moves and if so how far she moves. She rolls the dice one by one, stopping when she wishes, and the sum of the dice rolled can't exceed 7. If she rolls only one die, she moves forward by the number rolled; if she rolled two dice, she moves twice the sum of her dice (if the sum &le; 7); and if she rolled three dice, she moves three times the sum (again, if the sum &le; 7). If her sum exceeds 7, she removes her piece from the board and starts the lap from the beginning next turn.&#10;&#10;If one piece lands on another, the bottom piece must carry the top one when it next moves; what's more, the owner of the piece on top dictates how many dice the bottom player must roll &mdash; and if those dice sum to more than seven, then both pieces are removed from the track. Stacks can have any number of pieces, and whoever is on top dictates to the active player how many dice she must roll. When a piece in the middle of a stack moves, it leaves all pieces below it in place.&#10;&#10;When a piece or a stack lands on or passes the final space in the lap, the owner of the topmost piece takes one of the prize cards; each prize has a value on it, and once all the prizes have been claimed, whoever has the highest sum of prize cards wins.&#10;&#10;The 2014 edition of the game, Mah&eacute;, allows for play with up to seven player turtles, who are circling the island while trying to lay their eggs on the beach and receive points for doing a good job.&#10;&#10;The 2024 Korean edition of the game, &#234;&#179;&#181;&#235;&#163;&#161; &#235;&#140;&#128;&#236;&#158;&#145;&#236;&#160;&#132;, allows for play with up to seven player &#8;adventurers, who are circling the island while taking back stolen eggs on the T-Rex nest and receive points for taking a lot of eggs.&#10;&#10;";1974;6.36507;1.2264;2;7;20;6;Animals, Dice

Some questions are about one member of the opposite team - in which case all members of the answering team submit a guess - and some questions are of the style &quot;Which of us...?&quot;, in which case the answering team collaborates for a yes/no answer for each member of the opposite team. The goal is to answer the most questions correctly about the other team and have the highest points total at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;There is also a bonus round - and here the gender divide does matter, because the game is designed so that the boys are asking the girls questions that are supposedly hard for the girls to answer but that the boys themselves should easily know the answer to, and vice versa (no answers are provided for the bonus questions).

3404;The Legend of Landlock;"In this quick 2-player game, you take turns placing tiles that depict either bridges or streams, ultimately forming a 6x6 square. You score points by connecting your path (or stream) to as many sides of the square as possible, and by isolating your opponent's stream (or path). As you may have to place tiles that not only help you (and hinder your opponent), but also tiles that may hinder you (and help your opponent), there is a depth of strategy that is belied by whimsical art of the cardboard tiles. Similar to Carcassonne and Ta Y&#195;&#188;, but plays more quickly.&#10;&#10;2nd Place 1989 Hippodice Spieleautorenwettbewerb.&#10;2002 Mensa Select&#10;&#10;";1995;5.71965;1.2439;2;4;20;8;Abstract Strategy

3407;Key Whiz;"Key Whiz is a family oriented board/card game for 2 to 4 players. Each player has a game board, game pieces, and are dealt 4 to 6 cards depending on the number of players. Players take alternate turns moving one piece at a time from the start square and along the board with the ultimate goal of being the first to reach the payoff with all game pieces. Along the way are doors that must be passed thru using keys (card combinations such as a single card, pair, 3 of a kind, or 4 of a kind). There is a fair amount of strategy involved, and often times movements can be planned well in advance. Two of the major features are WHIZ CARDS (count as double) and BONUS PLAYS (additional moves) created by passing through a door. The two-player version is excellent for tournament play.&#10;&#10;";1990;0.0;0.0;2;4;20;10;Abstract Strategy, Card Game
3408;This Accursed Civil War;"This Accursed Civil War is a tactical battle game featuring five battles from the First English Civil War: 1642-1646. It is the first in the GMT Musket &amp; Pike Battle System covering warfare in the 17th Century. The system emphasizes Command and Control and the unique style of combat in that era. Armies are divided into three or four wings. Each wing has an order that limits the types of actions that units of that wing may perform. Wings may change their order, but it is not an easy task to accomplish. Victory goes to the commander who can coordinate the actions of these wings in the heat of battle. Units are infantry brigades, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries. Rules include Cavalry Charges, use of the Cavalry's pistols to skirmish or use in close combat, artillery grazing fire, Infantry techniques of fire including advancing, retreating, and salvo firing. Play is highly interactive, and a battle can be played through in one sitting.&#10;&#10;The battles included in this game are:&#10;&#10;Edgehill, 23 October 1642&#10;    Is the King beholden to Parliament or is he truly sovereign? King Charles and his army, their way to London barred by the army of Parliament, have drawn up to give battle. Edgehill was the first major battle of the war. Robert Devereax, Earl of Essex, commands the army of Parliament sent to prevent the King's army from reaching London. The fighting is indecisive as the bloodied Royalist foot fall back, but Essex conceded the field despite receiving reinforcements. A major victory for either side could have ended the war here.&#10;&#10;First Newbury, 20 September 1643&#10;    Outmaneuvered, Essex, with the Royalists under King Charles between his army and London, is forced to fight. Essex spies a hill southwest of Newbury and in the early morning occupies it. Hedges line the area and help minimize the King's advantage in Cavalry.&#10;&#10;Marston Moor, 2 July 1644&#10;    The largest battle of the war. It decided the fate of Northern England. An allied army of Scots under the Earl of Leven, the Northern Association under Ferdinando Fairfax, and the Eastern Association under the Earl of Manchester laid siege to the King's Northern Army under the Marquis of Newcastle at York, the key to the North. King Charles dispatched his nephew, the talented Prince Rupert, to effect a relief. The defeat was complete; the Royalist army was utterly destroyed and the North lost to Parliament. A new hero arises here: Cromwell, a name synonymous with the English Civil War and the key player in the later two civil wars.&#10;&#10;Second Newbury, 27 October 1644&#10;    The disaster that precipitated the forming of the New Model Army. Three Parliamentary armies come together and catch the King by surprise just north of Newbury. The most unconventional of all the battles; the superior Parliamentary force attacks from either end, but is short on time. Various options on gaining more time by shortening the flank march give this action high replay value.&#10;&#10;Naseby, 14 June 1645&#10;    The debut of the New Model Army and the battle that broke the back of the King's army. The New Model Army was created by combining the elements of the major armies in the field. While this worked well for the cavalry, there were serious problems in the infantry ranks. The King's army was outnumbered, but it retained its corps of veteran infantry. The final result was a decisive defeat for the King and the end of his military fortunes. Though fighting would last another year, the King would never field a potent army again.&#10;&#10;2nd Printing Note: This reprint version will include an updated series rulebook and playbook and an Edgehill variant scenario, as well as numerous updates to the counters.

3409;The Napoleonic Wars;"From GMT games:&#10;&#10;In The Napoleonic Wars, GMT Games brings you a fast-paced, tension-filled, card-driven wargame with a point-to-point movement system that pushes the envelope in a new direction for a pivotal period of history. Rooted soundly in Mark Herman's award-winning We The People system, The Napoleonic Wars provides refinements that allow two-to-five players to play an exciting game requiring two to ten hours. The majority of your games will easily end in a single evening, thanks to sudden death victory conditions providing variable game lengths that eliminate the &quot;end of the world&quot; phenomenon that plague many games. Often, you'll set 'em up and knock 'em down twice a night, and once in a great while your Campaign game will require two nights of play for the terrific panoramic history to unfold before your eyes.&#10;&#10;Like similar card-driven games, The Napoleonic Wars provides strategy cards that are played as events or to activate leaders, armies or fleets (by play of command points) to move on the map. Players must constantly weight the value of an event or reaction card against the need for its command points. Command points themselves can be played for a wide variety of activities, making play unpredictable and fresh with each sitting. Uncontrolled powers are governed by a diplomatic track which is also affected by play of command points and events.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;     Napoleonic Wars: Super Deluxe Map&#10;&#10;&#10;Revised by:   &#10;&#10;     The Napoleonic Wars: Update Kit (upgrade to 2nd edition)&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;     Wellington&#10;     The Napoleonic Wars (Second Edition) (aka 2008 reprint Edition)&#10;&#10;&#10;";2002;7.00419;3.4857;2;5;240;12;Napoleonic, Wargame

3411;Drive on Paris;"Drive on Paris, is a game simulating the first 100 days of fighting on the Western Front during World War I.&#10;&#10;The mobile campaign of 1914 in the west was the result of more than a generation of staff planning on both sides. The German General Staff had prepared the Schlieffen Master Plan of a giant right hook into France which its namesake had hoped would result in a Cannae-like battle of annihilation of France. The French believing that an attack would always win and that elan would carry the day, prepared to assault the lightly held German lines in Alsalce-Lorraine.&#10;&#10;Both plans failed.&#10;&#10;Drive on Paris allows both sides to execute the historical campaigns or variations on them and are rated for victory on how well their operation succeeds. Players can rearrange their Mobilization Points to change the change the force allocations from the historical ones to reinforce their effort or to better counter the enemy's.&#10;&#10;Both side must rapidly attack and defend at the same time...and you'll never have enough troops and power to do both perfectly, so your allocation of scarce resources will be the key to your success.&#10;&#10;This system uses a two-tracked method of determining victory. It isn't the usual &quot;one side tries something, while the other tries to stop it&quot;. Rather, both sides must strive toward their own goals while putting forth enough effort to stall the enemy. It is possible for both sides to &quot;win&quot; ending the game in a net draw (which is why you'll need to dedicate some effort to stopping the enemy support).&#10;&#10;Drive on Paris is the seventh game in the popular, easy-to-play Standard Combat Series. These games are designed to be easy enough for novice players, yet meaty enough to retain the interest of veterans. It violates two principals of game design at the same time: Easy games are dumb, and the converse that interesting games are hard. The SCS challenges these bogus assertions...and has successfully done so for eight years now.&#10;&#10;Part of the Standard Combat Series by The Gamers.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1/2 week&#10;Hex: 6.2 miles / 10 Km&#10;Units: Brigades to Division&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color map&#10;Two dual-side printed countersheet (420 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 8-page SCS version 1.6 system rulebook&#10;One 24-page Drive on Paris specific rulebook&#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&#10;Complexity Level: Low&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2-12 hours&#10;&#10;";2000;6.97541;2.6522;2;2;300;12;Wargame, World War I
3412;Brandywine;"An early morning fog burned off with the dawn, and revealed two long columns of scarlet and blue clad troops. This was His Majesty's Royal Army, commanded by General Sir William Howe. They were marching through the extreme southeastern corner of Pennsylvania and heading toward fledgling America's capital at Philadelphia. Only short weeks earlier this army had disembarked at Head of Elk, Maryland, after a 32-day voyage from New York City aboard the largest armada North America has ever seen. With some 14,000 troops, including crack German mercenaries and elite American Loyalist units, Howe's army was about to execute a flanking maneuver of &quot;Jacksonian&quot; proportions.&#10;&#10;General George Washington, holding interior lines at Morristown, New Jersey, was unsure whether Howe would move north in support of the British invasion from Canada (see Saratoga, 1777), or whether he would move south against the Capital. Once the armada set sail, however, Washington shifted southwest and took up a naturally strong defensive position, on high ground behind Brandywine Creek, astride the main road to Philadelphia. Washington posted his troops advantageously and in depth. Control of the fords of the Brandywine would be the key to his position and although a possible flank attack was discussed, it's likelihood was discounted on the strength of local information.&#10;&#10;Thus the stage was set. Howe, pursuing a strategy of posts, sought European style victory in a sudden taking of the enemy capital. Washington wrote, &quot;Should they push their designs against Philadelphia...they will put the contest on the event of a single battle. If they are overthrown...the war is at an end. One bold stroke will free the land.&quot;&#10;&#10;";2000;7.35073;2.6667;2;2;240;12;Age of Reason, American Revolutionary War, Wargame
3413;Saratoga;"In all the spectacle of war there has seldom been a sight the equal of British General Burgoyne's campaign of 1777. The float and march south from Canada had almost a surreal quality juxtaposed against the Adirondack wilderness. Hundreds of vessels making up an immense inland navy on Lake Champlain transported nearly 9,000 combatants together with 138 cannon. Burgoyne's objective was Fort Ticonderoga and from there, Albany, and a rendezvous with British forces coming from New York City. The strategic purpose of the campaign was nothing short of an end to the American Rebellion.&#10;&#10;The intrigue on the American side lay in the cult of personality. Saratoga was to be Benedict Arnold's greatest victory in a string of successes which rank him among the finest field commanders of the era. Known to all Americans as the great traitor, it is ironic to discover that twice he salvaged the Revolution from certain collapse. It was Arnold's conspicuous gallantry and bold leadership which assured America victory at Saratoga and, by extension, its independence.&#10;&#10;The fighting at Freeman's Farm would be savage. Here no farmer's militia, but rather Continental Regulars (anxious to redeem a recent reputation for retreat), stood toe to toe with Europe's finest. The sanguinary nature of the fighting was summed up best by American Brigadier General John Glover who said, &quot;Both sides seemed determined to conquer or die.&quot;&#10;&#10;It's the 19th of September, 1777. Do you, as the British, attempt to storm the prepared American positions on the high ground at Bemis Heights in order to open up the River Road and the most direct route to Albany? Or do you attempt to turn the American left where intelligence reports the American defenses are incomplete and the ground favors your approach? How will you employ the large number of Hessian mercenaries in your army? Will their performance match their reputation?&#10;&#10;As the Americans do you wait on Bemis Heights for the approach of the enemy as General Gates preferred, or do you sortie and meet the approach of the British in the forests where their artillery will be of little value? Will Generals Gates and Arnold cooperate, or will their feud spell disaster for the American cause? And what of the fog on this chilly Autumn morning? Will it be an ally to the Americans by impeding the progress of the enemy?&#10;&#10;These are only a few of the challenges facing you as you relive one of history's most decisive battles and the turning point of the American Revolution.&#10;&#10;";1998;7.15188;2.5532;2;2;180;12;Age of Reason, American Revolutionary War, Wargame

3416;Fallschirmjaeger: The Airborne Assault on Fortress Holland;"Fallschirmjaeger: The Airborne Assault on Fortress Holland May 10 to 14, 1940, simulates the German May, 1940 capture of Rotterdam and The Hague (Den Haag).&#10;&#10;In the spring of 1940, the German military machine turned west to convert the Phoney War into a real one. Fresh from his victory in Poland, Hitler planned a blow that would knock France out of the war. key to this plan was knife-like attack through the Ardennes to the English Channel which would split the Allied forces moving north to block the expected replay of 1914 and the Maginot Line forces immobile in the south. To add to the trap, the Germans planned the first massive airborne operation of the war. This attack would capture the hinterland of Holland, pave the way for subordinate German Armored thrusts crossing the Maas, and to continue the lure the Allies northward.&#10;&#10;Fallschirmjaeger covers this bait. The German player plops down an airborne invasion force with the goal of fighting off all-comers until relieved by advancing ground forces. The Dutch, all but abandoned by their French and British Allies, put up a fight for the record books. The German air bridge held on by its fingernail. While the main German drive was never in doubt, these scattered paratroopers had the fight of their lives against a small nation unwilling to succumb without giving the fight everything.&#10;&#10;In the end, the Dutch government had to be evacuated along with the Dutch Gold Reserve, to form a government in exile. They would return after liberation.&#10;&#10;The player must do all these things, or smash the German paratroopers before they are rescued by the Panzers, to win. Any German player thinking he'll have an easy time, must be reminded his is not Nazi Germany's main effort and that he must make-do on a shoestring.&#10;&#10;Fallschirmjaeger is the eighth game in the popular Standard Combat Series by The Gamers.

3417;Tribulation;"In Tribulation, number tiles are laid out in a 7 x 7 grid, similarly to Boggle.  Each tile has a number from 1 to 9 on it (the 9 tile is also used as a 6 in some editions).  Number disks from 1-50 are shuffled, and one is drawn.  Players race to find three tiles whose equation (first times second, plus or minus third, or any other combination of two tiles multiplied and the other added or subtracted) adds to that total.  The first to do so wins the disk.  Whomever has the most disks when they are all claimed wins the game.&#10;&#10;Nominally the game is for 1-6 players, although the upper bound is arbitrary and the rules say nothing about how the game might be played solo. Possible solo challenges involve seeing how many tokens you can claim in a set time (e.g. 10 minutes total) or how many tokens you can claim racing against a countdown timer (e.g. 5-10 seconds per token).&#10;&#10;";1974;5.79466;1.5;1;6;30;10;Math, Real-time

3425;Skunk;"Similar to Cosmic Wimpout, but much easier and kid friendly.  This is a very simple point-scoring/risk-taking game in which players roll a set of two dice, where the &quot;1&quot; has been replaced by a picture of a skunk.  Everyone gets little poker chips, like in many gambling games, and a player rolls as much as he wishes during his turn, earning points equal to what he rolls. A player passes the dice when he wishes, but if he rolls one or two skunks, points rolled during that turn are ignored and penalties (in the form of discarding some of their poker chips) are enforced.  First player to achieve 100 points (or higher) wins that round, and play continues for as long players wish.  The winner is whoever has the most chips to his name (in typical poker values of 1, 5, and 10).  Number of max players seems to be only limited by the number of poker chips you use (each player starts with 50). This game is no longer manufactured, at least under the theme of &quot;Skunk.&quot;&#10;&#10;At least one BGG member has a copy dated 1953, but it's possible the game came out earlier.&#10;&#10;";1953;5.75472;1.0;2;8;30;6;Animals, Dice

And if you don't know what Charades is, it's an old parlor game in which you silently mime the title word by word as your team-mates shout out their guesses to much hilarity all round.&#10;&#10;";1986;4.8;0.0;2;8;60;10;Action / Dexterity, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Party Game

3430;The Three Stooges Card Game;"This game is very reminiscent of Lunch Money.  You play attack cards on other players from your hand of 5 until either you run out of cards or another player plays a defensive card.  Cards can set up combo's and some can redirect the attack elsewhere.&#10;&#10;Cards have appropriate pictures of the Stooges covering the whole card based on what the card is.  The cards come in the varieties you would expect such as Poke in the Eye, Duck and of course Nyuck! Nyuck! Nyuck!.

Player's counters are the 7 deadly sins, Sloth, Avarice etc. You draw a Personality card, giving a clue to the type, eg sports, politician etc, the next player draws a PSI card and asks &quot;If you were a Language/ Salad Dressing/Letter Of The Alphabet, which would you be?&quot;. You're supposed to answer as if you were the personality and the questioner is supposed to guess who you are. If they guess correctly, they advance along a track, if they fail, the next player tries another question and so on. If no-one guesses correctly, you reverse down the track for giving bad clues. The hilarious party element is that the Personality cards include the Sins, so you would answer as if you were that player.&#10;&#10;";1987;3.92;1.25;3;7;30;15;Party Game

3434;Golden Deuce;"This game is based on the ancient Chinese game of Choi Dai Di (Known as 'Big Two' in English, similar to Pusoy Dos in the Philippines).  This special deck, however, has 60 cards, instead of the standard 52, which changes (for the better) the odds of the game and increases the strategy involved.  Another difference from the classic game, is that the publishers have added a game board for keeping score, adding even more strategy, because players have choices on how to move their pawns.&#10;&#10;The game starts with a round of the Golden Deuce card game - lay down higher tricks than the other players for control of the lead. Be the first player to lay down all the cards in your hand, and you gain points for all the cards left in the other players' hands.&#10;&#10;Moving to the game board, each player strategically moves any of their pawns the number of spaces to match the points earned in the card game round. Players can choose to move all of their pawns around the board at once (and therefore be able to block out opponents) or move one at a time (and capitalize on the amount of spaces moved).&#10;&#10;Once all players have moved, another card game round starts, and the game ends when one player has moved all of their pawns to the finish.&#10;&#10;";2002;5.41659;1.6875;2;4;90;10;Card Game
3435;Zwergen Ziehen;"Each night, in two neighboring gardens in a sleepy suburb, an astonishing spectacle takes place: Colorful garden gnomes awaken from their statuesque slumber, straining and stretching themselves in order to move their stiff limbs. They form two teams and with the help of a garden hose that they place under a fence, the gnomes organize a Tug-of-War. They shout, moan, swear, and insult each other. Sweat streams down in large drops from under their gnomish hats. They try to pull together at the fence. Squirrels from the neighborhood hurry to gather there. They can&rsquo;t sleep with all the noise and they gather at the garden's edge in order to watch the spectacle.&#10;&#10;Garden dwarves make a &quot;pull the rope&quot; competition. During his turn, each player plays a card which allows him to add a dwarf of a certain color on his side of the rope or to make dwarves of a particular color stronger (or weaker). When dwarves are actually pulling the rope, you slide a part of the cute little board.&#10;&#10;";1997;5.74282;1.1333;2;4;20;10;Card Game

3437;Gogol;"Gogol was conceived in a prison, where no paper or pencils were allowed. Designed to be playable under the most primitive circumstance, each move in Gogol sets off firecrackers of endless possibility!&#10;There are two players (White and Black), each having one king and eight pawns at their command.&#10;On a common chessboard, place eight white pawns on the first rank and eight black pawns on the eighth. Then, the White player may place his king anywhere on the board, except on the second rank. Black, in turn, places his king anywhere except on the seventh rank.  The game then starts, each player moving in turn.&#10;The pawns are free to move anywhere on the board, not being confined to moving along lines or diagonals! (You can think of this as &quot;teleportation&quot;.)  The king may move along any straight line or diagonal, like a chess Queen.  &#10;If a piece begins its turn adjacent to an enemy piece, then it can capture the enemy piece by jumping over it (straight or diagonally), and landing into an empty on the other side of (and adjacent to) the captured piece.&#10;The player who captures the enemy king, or reaches the last rank with his own king, wins the game.&#10;For more information, please go to http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/gogol.htm&#10;&#10;";2002;6.075;2.0;2;2;20;10;Abstract Strategy

3439;HeroClix;"HeroClix is a tactical combat miniatures game where you put heroes and villains from your favorite comics, movies, and TV shows in head-to-head combat. It utilizes the patented Combat Dial System originally found in the collectible Mage Knight miniatures game.&#10;&#10;HeroClix miniatures use the combat dial to reflect a change in a characters' combat values, powers, and abilities over time. Some characters will pivot from long range to close quarters combat styles, others will move from acting aggressively to stealing their opponent's energy. The easiest thing to observe will be which characters are worn down by battle and which ones experience rage from getting hurt that helps them strike back at their foes! HeroClix uses gridded maps instead of a measure-and-move system, as well as die rolling.&#10;&#10;HeroClix has been around since 2002, and as such there are tons of choices for your favorite characters, and nearly any comic character you can imagine has been featured in the game at one point or another!&#10;&#10;";2002;6.51585;2.8112;2;2;60;10;Collectible Components, Comic Book / Strip, Dice, Fighting, Miniatures

3444;Royal Comette;"Subtitle:&#10;&#10;&quot;A Courtly Game of Risk an Speculation&quot;&#10;&#10;Themed on the discovery of a comet by Halley in 1682, this is an imitation of a courtly game of the period. In Royal Comette, players place tokens on astronomical sections on the board, lay cards in a sequence, and when your card matches a section, you collect the tokens.&#10;&#10;Unlike the title, there is little speculation in the game.&#10;&#10;Game Play:&#10;&#10;At the start, all players (including the dealer) place a token (a small yellow rod) on each of the eight compartments of the game-board. The dealer then places extra tokens on certain compartments and hands every player and equal number of cards. One extra hand of cards is dealt to the center of the game-board. When all cards are equally divided, the remainder cards are added to the center. The dealer turns the last card over to determine the trump of that round. If the trump is a certain card, the dealer instantly wins all tokens on the board, else, the round is played.&#10;&#10;A round of play consist of players playing card out and calling their names (e.g. the Ace of Spades). The next player is the player who has the first next card in that sequence. The round comes to an halt when either the card to be played cannot be played (it was already played before or is in the center 'hand') or when all players have been dealer once or when a previously agreed number of rounds has been played.&#10;&#10;Players collect tokens from the board if they have won the round. Winning the round depends on the cards a player has in hand. The player that has the most tokens at when the game ends, is the winner.&#10;&#10;";1996;3.63889;0.0;3;6;30;10;Card Game

One card even introduces a new victory condition.&#10;&#10;This expansion set works with any version of Monopoly.&#10;&#10;The author had originally planned to create additional expansions for Monopoly which could provide opportunities to buy the Jail, Tax, and Chance spaces and collect rent on them, various nasty ways to accidentally (and not so accidentally) die, extra railroads and utilities that will allow players to charge obscene amounts of rent, and new ways to extort huge sums of money and favors from friends and family.

Three complete games are included: Sicily-Invade and capture Italy's southern island fortress, Normandy Breakout-Direct the critical campaign on the sweep to Berlin, and Battle of the Bulge-The daring breakthrough to Bastogne.  A two-sided (19&quot; x 26&quot;) game board is provided.&#10;&#10;The game maps are historically accurate, as well as the initial troop deployments. Troop movement per turn is dictated by 24 troop movement cards. Allied and German units are 112 die cut cardboard pieces. Battles are resolved using 5 red and 5 white battle dice.&#10;&#10;The game plays very well for a wargame of its age. The troop movement card deck works better than one might think. Moving the little cardboard counters is typical of wargames of this era. And the battle resolution based upon rolling multiples of any number seems unbalanced at first, but after a few plays you realize that it too works as well as the troop movement card deck.  Two very innovative wargaming mechanisms that allow for quick movement and battle resolution. Thus the game moves fast, but does not sacrifice battle and movement detail(s).&#10;&#10;Copyright (c) 1973 RGI - Research Games, Inc and ATHOL Game Co., 200 Fifth Ave., New York, NY 10010&#10;&#10;Also see: Major Campaigns of General Douglas MacArthur&#10;&#10;";1973;6.44052;1.7619;2;2;30;12;Wargame, World War II
3460;Kaubojai;"Players move around the board and are able to buy ranches. Each ranch differs in cost and maximum capacity of cattle. When player buys ranch, he is also able to buy some cattle. Each time player will pass the ranch again the cattle number will double, until it will reach the maximum number. When player stops on ranch, he/she may take some cattle and bring to town to sell (if he will take all cattle, he will have to sell ranch since ranch cannot be left without cattle). However, since each time cattle doubles, it is better to wait until it grows. But, yet again, you may not step on a ranch for a long time later; so, you may loose cattle if number will reach maximum. Also, you may steal other players&rsquo; cattle by stepping on their ranches. If you do so, you will have to reach town without being captured by the player you stole cattle from. Players, if their cattle is stolen, can chase thieves not only through ordinary routes, but also through cutaways, however if he will use them, he could lose ability to step on his ranches and take cattle to town for sell. If thief is captured, he must give cattle to owner and pay fine. Each robbed ranch is automatically sold to bank and could be bought again. If player steps on casino, he/she could play for money. Player could then bid money and roll die. If it rolls 1, 3 or 5, player looses money. If it rolls 2, 4 or 6 he takes his money back and also the same amount of money from bank.

The one who does that the first wins.&#10;&#10;At the start all players take chance tokens and place them upside down on various board tiles. Later each player gets energy tokens. Then they roll the die and move as many tiles as the number they rolled. If a player wants, he/she could lose one (or more) of his energy tokens and go climb as many spaces as the number of energy tokens he/she gave up. If player steps on a chance token, he/she must take it and do whatever it says. There are various tokens - some orders to go some spaces up or down, some orders to roll die again. If player takes a card with a lion or aborigines, he must fight by placing any number of energy tokens between 1 and 5 and rolling die. If rolled number is higher than tokens placed, player will lose. If player   loses to the aborigines, they will rob him/her and the player will lose all energy tokens. If player loses against the lion, he will have to fight again and again (each fight is one turn). If player loses all of his/her energy tokens, he/she loses the game. If player passes another player, he/she must give him/her one energy token. If player steps on tile occupied by other player, that other player must give him/her energy token. If player wins against lion, he must go back to the nearest village. If two players step on lion at the same time, they must fight against the lion together by placing energy tokens.

3469;China Topf;"In English, this game is called &quot;Chinese Wok&quot;, after the small wooden wok that is the centerpiece of the game.  The 3&quot; wok has a round bottom, which causes it to be wobbly.  Each player is given an assortment of wooden &quot;food&quot; items of different colors, and the object of the game is to be the first player to place all of your food into the wok.  The items include orange carrots, white eggs, green peas, blue fish, yellow pasta, and purple chopsticks.&#10;&#10;Each player takes turns rolling a special die.  On each face of the die are two colors. The player selects one of their food items that matches one of the rolled colors, and carefully places the item into the unstable wok.  If any items fall out of the wok, the player must take those items (up to two pieces) and place them back into the wok on subsequent turns.&#10;&#10;A number of &quot;tofu&quot; cubes are included that may be placed into the wok at the beginning of the game to adjust the difficulty level or compensate for the number of players.&#10;&#10;";1996;6.47368;1.0;2;4;20;4;Action / Dexterity, Children's Game
3471;Le Mans;"The great-grandfather of today's racing games, elements of Le Mans are clearly evident in games like Formula D&eacute;.  Le Mans offers the choice of twelve different car specifications that detail the number of spaces the car travels in each gear and which gears the cars can safely negotiate turns.  Also, the different car types have different braking characteristics.&#10;&#10;The game includes two tracks printed on the same board, Monte Carlo and Le Mans.  Each track is only two lanes wide, and the spaces on the track are only a half-car-length, so a car takes up two spaces at once.&#10;&#10;The cars move in order of track position. Each turn, a car may either remain in the same gear, shift up one gear, or shift down according to the car's specifications.  It must then move the exact number of spaces required by the particular model of car in the specified gear.&#10;&#10;When cornering, if a car exceeds the gear specified for the particular model of car, it must &quot;take a chance.&quot;  The driver must roll the die to determine if the car safely cornered, spun out, crashed, or damaged the car such that a pit stop is required.  If a car spins out, a &quot;wet track&quot; marker is placed on the corner, subsequently requiring all cars to roll for a chance when going through it.&#10;&#10;If a car is blocked and cannot move the entire number of spaces required (and the car has no more hard braking left and cannot down shift enough), the cars collide.  Collisions require that the involved cars make a pit stop for repairs.&#10;&#10;Optional rules include guidelines for slipstreaming, over-revving to move an extra space, and details of team, solo, and timed play, and &quot;Le Mans-style&quot; starts.&#10;&#10;The game is a revised version of Wright-Mudge Enterprises' Grand Prix: A Sports Car Racing Game.&#10;&#10;";1961;6.43578;2.1818;1;12;60;10;Racing, Sports

3473;RisiKard!;"Risikard is similar to Risk in that players are warring over global territories. However, in Risikard, battles are resolved by use of cards, instead of dice, and the board serves more as a visual indicator than a gaming area.&#10;&#10;The game consists of 1 small map board, 2 tank pieces, a rule book and 110 cards.&#10;&#10;There are 42 Territory Cards, each representing one of the areas on the map. Of the information on these cards, the most important are the number 'Value', of which a certain amount are needed to win the game, and the 'Winning Symbol' (explained below). There are 54 Army Cards and one Wild Card. All army cards have symbols representing either infantry, cavalry or artillery and a value from 1-6. There are also 13 Mission Cards, which remain hidden to others throughout the game, and state the formula one must obtain to win.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, territories are selected one at a time and starting army hands and a mission card are drawn.&#10;&#10;Each turn then commences with an attack by declaring war on an adjacent territory. Cards are revealed from the attacker and defenders hand and whoever has the higher number wins, the wild card trumping any other value. When one player wins two battles, that person gains the other's territory card.&#10;&#10;The second stage of the turn is the protection of territories. In this turn you may choose to defend territories by presenting three Territory Cards with different 'Winning Symbols' from the same continent (also known as a &quot;set&quot;). Protected territories may not be attacked but also can't aid to increase your number of army cards. Army cards in hand are then discarded and the same number of cards are drawn at which point the player may attack again.&#10;&#10;In the final stage of a turn, the player adjusts his/her hand based on the number of sets that aren't part of protected territories that they control.&#10;&#10;The game is won when a player fulfills the requirements of the 'victory formula' stated on his/her Mission Card. An example of this formula is you must control all of Africa, Oceania and you must have additional territories totalling a value of 12 or more. Players can be eliminated from the game prior to the game's end.&#10;&#10;";1996;5.45;1.5;3;6;20;0;Card Game, Wargame

3484;Armada;"A board game with a nicely realized island group, which offers protection for either four nations or four pirate bands (depending on the edition) and indigenous people. Components: 300 plastic markers, 150 tokens, 8 ships made of metal with 2 masts, 55 cards (3rd edition only), 3 six-sided special dice, 1 rules booklet.&#10;&#10;Between the second and third edition, the theme of the game changed. The first and second have a theme of four nations exploring and colonizing new land, while the third edition has a pirate theme. The third edition also adds 55 action cards, resulting in more chaos and - possibly - less strategy (at least that's what is suggested in the rules).&#10;&#10;The board shows an island group composed of five smaller island groups separated by ocean. There is a large island group in the middle and four smaller ones in the corners. The four smaller island groups are the homelands of the four nations in editions 1 and 2 and the pirate bases in edition 3. Nations / pirates set out to explore and conquer the big island group in the middle (or each others' homelands).&#10;&#10;Every round, each nation / pirate group has 10 action points. With these you can accomplish various actions: move, load ships, explore unknown areas, attack your opponents, etc. Most important action is probably exploration, in which you roll two special dice which determine how many natives and how much gold there is in a neighboring, unexplored land. You'll have to fight the natives to conquer that land and get the gold. The gold itself you use to muster new armies / pirates. Conquest ultimately decides the winner.&#10;&#10;In the 3rd edition, you can use special cards to optimize your course or counter the actions of opponents.

3485;Anno Domini;"Anno Domini is a wargame for four players and consists of a map board, a deck of cards, 12 dice, cardboard coins, miniature castles and cathedrals and a rule book.&#10;&#10;Players start by randomly selecting a Pope and proceeding with the random selection of all 36 territories. These are claimed by placing a castle and cathedral on the specified area of the map board.&#10;&#10;Play commences with the Administrative Phase where players collect taxes based on the number of territories and cathedrals they control. Following is the Military phase that is divided into three optional steps. The first is to roll 2d6 for a random event that will cause the player to either gain or lose money, lose cards, lose castles or become the pope. The second option is to build new castles on your territories. The final is an attack on another person's territory.&#10;&#10;Territories can attack adjacent territories or those on the same body of water. The attacking and defensive force are determined by the number of castles on each territory. For each castle on his/her territory, the attacker and defenders each roll a die and apply any modifiers obtained by cathedrals or cards in his/her possession. Results of 6 or over destroy a castle of the opposing side. If all of the defenders castles are lost, the attacker wins the territory, places a castle to claim it and may draw a card at the end of the phase. Cards offer various benefits such as money, attack/defence points or game actions.&#10;&#10;Play continues until one player controls 8 cathedrals.&#10;&#10;... and apparently the castles are cute.&#10;&#10;";1995;5.96877;1.7273;4;4;60;10;Medieval, Territory Building

3499;3-D Chess;"There are many forms of 3D Chess, the earliest being Kubicschach, which is German for Cubic Chess and was designed by the French Chess master Lionel Adalbert Bagration Felix Kieseritzky, in 1851.&#10;Kubicschach, as the name suggests, is eight standard Chess boards stacked up to for an 8x8x8 cube, it never became a popular game.&#10;&#10;Kubicschach was reduced by Doctor Ferdinand Maack in 1907, to five 5x5 boards and renamed Raumschach, which is German for Space Chess.&#10;It was played a lot in Germany during the beginning of the 20th century.&#10;&#10;The Dynamic Games company first produced a three 8x8 board in 1973 and sold it under the name Strato Chess. The game has been copied by many companies since and is the most widely available of all 3D Chess boards.&#10;&#10;The most famous variant of 3D Chess appeared in the Star Trek television show in 1966, in which it was referred to as 'Three Dimensional Chess'.&#10;The original stage property was designed by Irving A Feinberg and consisted of three 4x4 boards and four movable 2x2 boards.&#10;It was developed into a real game by the technical designer Franz Joseph Schnaubelt in his 1975 book, the Star Fleet Technical Manual and improved by a fan and chess player Andrew Bartmess, whose rules are some of the most popular.&#10;Fans of Star Trek still call it 'Three Dimensional Chess' but players of the game call it by the title Schnaubelt popularised 'Tri Dimensional Chess'.&#10;&#10;In 1985, the game design Gary Gygax published rules for Dragon Chess in Dragon magazine.&#10;A Dragon Chess board is three 8x12 boards stacked up and includes the extra pieces: Sylph, Griffon, Dragon, Warrior, Oliphant, Unicorn, Hero, Thief, Cleric, Mage, Paladin, Dwarf, Basilisk and Elemental.&#10;&#10;Max Chappell started designing Hyperchess in the early '70s but didn't produce and sell the first commercial set until 1996.&#10;Although it was influenced by the tri dimensional chess board, it has been described as more helical in design.&#10;&#10;In 2001 William d&#039;Agostino recreated the Strato Chess board and called it Millenium Chess, with the idea of extending Classic Chess, whithout distorting the game.&#10;&#10;";1851;5.92121;4.0714;2;2;90;0;Abstract Strategy, Movies / TV / Radio theme
3500;Schmuggler an Bord;"The game consists of a board, showing 30 different types of contraband goods, Gold, Cigarettes etc, each marked by a small picture and it's name. Each picture has a matching tile, which is placed face down over it. Players each receive a number of chips and then take two or three (depending on the number of players), of the tiles for themselves, announcing which they have taken and then laying them face down in front of them. Now play begins.&#10;&#10;The players take turns to roll the die and then move around the board. At first they generally land on a space where the picture is covered by a tile. They take this tile for themselves, and lay it face down in front of them announcing as they do so which it was. As the tiles start to disappear though, players land on spaces where the tile is already missing. They then have to say who they think has that tile. If correct, they receive the tile. If the named player however thinks that he hasn't got the tile, then he may in turn name another player, and so on until either a named player accepts that he has the tile, or a player who has already been named is named again. Then it is sorted out who really did have the tile, working backwards through the chain of accusations until it is found. The owner, when unmasked, passes it to the first player correctly to have named him, and all players who have falsely accused someone must pay chips into the Bank, one chip for each false accusation made in that turn.&#10;&#10;Obviously, the passing on of tiles complicates matters terribly. It is simple enough to remember who took the tile in the first place, but by the time you have unraveled a chain of four or five false accusations, trying to remember who now has the tile is not so simple. The game goes on until either someone has collected a specified number of tiles, dependent on the number of players, or someone has no chips left. A player's tiles count two points each and every remaining chip one point, so it is quite possible to win without collecting many tiles, you merely have to avoid guessing falsely.&#10;(Jon Webley from GameCabinet)&#10;&#10;";1992;6.09923;1.25;3;6;30;8;Memory

3502;Star of the Guardians;"Star of the Guardians is a 2-player Collectible Card Game in which the players play cards to deploy spaceships and destroy each other's empire.  The game is set in a science-fiction setting of the same name, novelized in a 4-book series by Margaret Weis.  For the game, players buy (collect) cards to build up their decks, which are shuffled and from which cards are drawn into hands and played.&#10;&#10;Players take on the roles of Warlords and to deploy their navies, they play system cards, which bestow Influence points.  Other cards can then be played if their cost in Influence are met.  Personality cards provide special abilities and personality points, which are required to play certain cards.  Fate, Damage, Artifacts and Tactics cards are played to alter the outcomes of battles fought among the deployed naval ships (Battleships, Carriers, Destroyers, etc) and squadrons of fighters and bombers.&#10;&#10;Star of the Guardians uses a lane-based combat system (Lane-To-Lane&trade;).  Each player's fleet is deployed in five columns (lanes).  The frontline ships bear the brunt of the fight while the ships behind them can give support, depending on their positions and cards played.  When a player's fleet has been destroyed, his or her home system is open to attack.  Any damage done to a player's home system reduces his or her power, and when a player's power has been reduced to zero, he or she loses the game.&#10;&#10;";1995;4.53024;2.0;2;2;20;10;Card Game, Collectible Components, Fighting, Science Fiction

Game play is the same as the classic board game except for a few interesting twists:&#10;&#10;&middot; When you attack an opponent&rsquo;s piece, the computer tells you whether you have won, lost, or tied.  So you do not know the exact strength of the opposing piece, only its strength relative to your own piece (and so too your opponent does not know the exact strength of the piece you used to attack with).  This feature makes the game quite a bit more interesting than standard Stratego.&#10;&#10;&middot; Instead of moving one of your pieces on your turn, you can &ldquo;probe&rdquo; an opposing piece to find its strength.

3564;Programmer's Nightmare;"In this game, players take turns laying out program instructions with &quot;ownership bits&quot; on the cards they play, creating a long line of interrelating program instructions that become more complicated as the program builds. Finally, a player will play a RUN card and set the program running. Who will survive the convolutions of the program? That's anyone's guess; each player decides if and how their own program instructions will function!&#10;&#10;There is a &quot;Version 2&quot; of the game in the rules; the program is dealt out at random in a loop, the players take turns claiming instructions that they think will let them win the game. Much of this game's strategy is based upon the initial selection of Program Instructions. Version two involves much more strategy and less luck.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.58043;2.5;2;6;20;12;Card Game
3566;Thinking Man's Football;"Originally published as Pro Football and later rebranded Thinking Man&rsquo;s Football, this strategic head-to-head simulation captures the cerebral side of American football. Released as part of the 3M Sports Games line, it focuses on play selection, tactical prediction, and statistical outcomes.&#10;&#10;Each turn, the offensive player secretly selects a play&mdash;run, pass, or special play&mdash;while the defense chooses a formation and one of three areas to guard: left, center, or right. Both choices are revealed simultaneously, and a chart combined with a die roll determines the result of the play: yardage gained or lost.&#10;&#10;Standard football rules for downs, possession, and scoring apply. The game plays out over two halves, challenging players to outthink one another while balancing risk and field position.&#10;&#10;Unlike arcade-style football games, Thinking Man&rsquo;s Football emphasizes play-calling strategy and probability, making it a great fit for fans of sports analytics, gridiron tactics, and old-school simulation.&#10;&#10;";1966;5.51912;2.3;2;2;90;0;Sports

3570;Chicken Cha Cha Cha;"Theme: Chickens are learning to dance (&quot;cha cha&quot;) by completing circuits around the yard.&#10;&#10;Goal: To &quot;cha cha&quot; your chicken past every single other player's chicken, stealing each one's &quot;tail feathers&quot; as you go by them. The first player to collect all of the tail feathers wins.&#10;&#10;Setup: There are two sets of large, thick cardboard tiles.  One set of 12 are shaped as octagons, and the other set of 24 are shaped as eggs. Each octagon shows a different chicken-related image, and the same image appears on two of the eggs. The octagons are spread out randomly on the table, face down. The eggs are then arranged randomly, but face up, in a large circle around the octagons, creating a kind of &quot;pathway&quot; of egg tiles that is encircling the &quot;yard&quot; (of octagons). Each player has a single large wooden chicken in their color, and each chicken has slots on its backside into which wooden &quot;tail feathers&quot; may be stuck. Each chicken begins with only one tail feather, in its color. The chickens are then placed randomly on the egg tiles, with an equal number of unoccupied tiles separating each chicken from the next chicken &quot;ahead&quot; of it on the pathway as separate it from the next chicken &quot;behind&quot; it, with the goal that they be well spread out on the pathway.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: The game is then played in turns, with players attempting to move their chickens clockwise around the pathway. On a player's turn, she looks at the image on the next egg tile in front of her chicken. The player then turns over one of the 12 face down octagon yard tiles. If the tile turned over shows the same image as the egg tile, the player moves forward one space on to that egg tile, turns the octagon back face down, and then repeats the process with the next egg tile. When the player turns over an octagon with an image that does not match the next egg tile in front of her, her turn ends and her chicken goes no farther. If the next tile in front of a player is occupied by someone else's chicken, then the player looks at the image that is on the egg tile in front of the other chicken, and then attempts to turn over the octagon showing *that* image. If the player succeeds, her chicken &quot;leapfrogs&quot; over the chicken in front of her to land on that egg tile, and in the process steals all tail feathers that the other chicken had - including those it stole from other players in the same manner. When one player has all of the tail feathers, that player wins the game.&#10;&#10;In Sum: A creative memory game that ties memory to pawn movement.  The first player to successfully memorize the images on each of the 12 octagon tiles, both from their own turns and from watching other players flip the octagons on their turns, will be able to move their chicken around the yard without stopping, and in doing so will win the game. The placement of the octagons is random, so the challenge is fresh each game.&#10;&#10;This game is part of The Chicken Family of Zoch&#10;&#10;The Zicke Zacke Igelkacke version has the same rules but hedgehogs instead of chicken, and it's in a smaller box.&#10;The Hasbro version has the same rules, but is a Dragon Tales re-theme with large cardboard dragons as player pieces.&#10;&#10;";1997;6.57368;1.1212;2;4;20;4;Animals, Children's Game, Memory
3572;Invasion: America – Death Throes of the Superpower;"Invasion: America is a &quot;mini-monster&quot; wargame designed by Jim Dunnigan and published by SPI in 1976. It depicts a hypothetical corps-level invasion of North America by a coalition of three invaders: The European Socialist Coalition (ESC) staging their invasion from Cuba, the South American Union (SAU) invading from Columbia, and the Pan Asiatic League (PAL) invading along the Pacific coast. Defending North America is a coalition of the United States and Canada, with Central America and Mexico having been annexed earlier in the alternate history timeline. It can be played by 2, 3, or 4 players.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a 35 inch by 42 inch map of North America in which each 'hex' is approximately 130 kilometers (81 mi) from side to side. Distinctive color and symbology is used to represent which of the nine different terrain types dominates the hex. There is additional symbology for ports, supply sources, resource centers and amphibious landing zones. There are also map features along the hexsides including rivers, borders, and and other boundaries. Both movement and combat are affected by terrain.&#10;&#10;There are 400 (7 are blank) 1/2-inch cardboard pieces (unit counters) representing the land, air, and naval military and logistics units of each combatant. The unit counters have numerical combat and movement ratings. Land and Air units are double-sided with their actual combat values on one side, and a question mark on the other side to indicate the unit's &quot;untried&quot; status, making it the first game to have this feature. Units are initially deployed as untried, and only when they are committed to combat is their true strength revealed.&#10;&#10;On each turn players may move all, some or none of their units through a number of hexes equal to or less than its movement rating allows. After movement is completed units that are adjacent to enemy units may engage in combat. Combat strengths are totaled for all participating units on each side and the relative strengths are expressed as a simplified odds ratio. A 6-sided die is rolled and the appropriate odds column is consulted to determine the combat result. Combat may result in retreats and/or losses to attacker, defender or both.&#10;&#10;Invasion: America includes six different scenarios lasting 8 turns and a campaign game of 60 turns. Each turn of the game represents one month. Scenario instructions define each side's order of battle and initial deployment, their unit replacement rates and victory conditions. Victory is determined by control of urban, supply and resource hexes that yield victory points.&#10;&#10;Invasion: America was a popular game for SPI and led to a larger, more complicated sequel in 1978, Objective Moscow, in which it was the Soviet Union that was being invaded.&#10;&#10;";1976;6.65819;3.1786;2;5;240;12;Modern Warfare, Wargame

3578;BattleBots: Kickbot Arena;"In this two player game, player takes turns choosing a team of 5 Bots. Each Bot rolls 2 or 3 dice each of which can specialize in offense or defense. Each die has a combination of the following faces:&#10;&#10;Super Hit, which destroys an opponent's die of your choice.&#10;&#10;Hit, which destroys one Damaged die.&#10;&#10;Damaged, which is eliminated by a Hit or Super Hit.&#10;&#10;Armor, which is eliminated by a Super Hit only.&#10;&#10;One player rolls their dice onto the board which represent the arena, then the other player does the same.

If one player is out of dice, their robot is destroyed and they must choose a new one for the next round.&#10;&#10;The game is in the actual throwing of the dice, which adds a dexterity element. The arena has four holes which act as traps that the dice can fall through. Players can throw their dice at an opponent's in a attempt to change the results, or knock them into a hole or out of the arena. There are also two small areas called &quot;Pulverizer Zones&quot;, if a die lands in this area, the opponent gets the opportunity to throw a special &quot;Pulverizer&quot; die into the arena.&#10;&#10;";2001;4.37187;1.1667;2;2;10;8;Action / Dexterity, Dice, Fighting, Movies / TV / Radio theme

3581;Lion of the North: The Dawn of Modern Warfare, 1631-1632;"(From the publisher)&#10;The war for minds and souls had been raging for ten destructive years when the vaunted, virtually undefeated Catholic army of the Hapsburg emperor and his allied German states looked across the gentle valley of Breitenfeld directly into the blinding rays of the dawn of modern warfare. By the end of the day, Tilly's lumbering army lay smashed beyond redemption, the victim of rapid-firing artillery, fast-moving infantry and hard-charging cavalry. The prediction had come true: Breitenfeld signaled the ascendancy of Gustavus II Adolphus, King of Sweden, the Lion of the North.&#10;&#10;Lion of the North is the third volume in GMT's heralded Great Battles of History (GBoH) Series. The Thirty Years' War signaled the dawn of modern warfare ... a return to the supremacy of linear tactics, drill and discipline, to what some historians call &quot;the return of the legion.&quot; Lion of the North represents two of the most famous battles of that period:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Breitenfeld, 1631&#10;    Lutzen, 1632&#10;&#10;&#10;Scale:&#10;Time = 30 minutes per turn&#10;Map = 100 yards per hex&#10;Unit = 100 men per strength point&#10;&#10;&#10;This is in the line of GBOH games which include Alexander, SPQR, Caesar: The Civil Wars, Caesar: Conquest of Gaul, and Cataphract.

3582;Rennfieber;"Rennfieber is a horse-racing game where players auction for, train, bet on and race horses.&#10;&#10;In the first phase of the game players auction for horses, trying to gain those with the best potential form statistic (form). Form influences starting placement and the movement of each horse. This statistic starts low but can be influenced by winning and losing races or through training. The pursuant training phase also allows the opportunity to collect cards that can influence form, aid in races and win money.&#10;&#10;Before a race, players select which of their horses they wish to enter. Bets are placed on horses based on their form, starting position and taking into account any cards a player has to influence the race. During the race, players roll a die and compare the result to the horse's form to determine the movement value. Horses can move in and out of lanes based on the positions of other horses and any special cards that are used.&#10;&#10;At the end of the race, bets are resolved and a predetermined purse is paid to the top 3 horses. Play proceeds with a second race followed by a third stage of auctioning, training and racing. At the completion of the third race, the player with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;";1982;5.40909;3.0;2;6;90;12;Racing

3584;World War 3: 1976-1984;"World War 3- 1976-1984, is a simulation on an army/fleet level scale of a hypothetical, world-wide, conventional conflict at the height of the cold war (1976-1984). The simulation is primarily of land and naval conflict with the secondary influence of air forces. The game covers five years in seasonal (quarterly) turns. Optional rules allow Players to choose from several levels of complexity.&#10;&#10;With the increased number of small scale conflicts throughout the world had come increased tension and strain in relationships between the Soviet Union and the United States. Each superpower felt it necessary to choose sides in the local, &quot;conventional&quot; wars that proliferated in the late 1970's, until each felt small pressures from all directions. Eastern Europe, the Middle East, the Asian sub-continent, Southeast Asia, Africa and Central America were involved to various degrees, in conflict.&#10;&#10;Then, one side (we're not saying which) began to feel its position slipping, as its favored side in war after war became threatened, with the scale of the conflicts ever more violent. Warnings and violent talk were followed by the commitment of the first conventional land forces by a superpower. This was followed immediately by an even greater commitment from the other side, and the war of escalation was on.&#10;&#10;The Soviet Union struck first in Europe, and overran Germany and France in a matter of weeks. Italy and the smaller countries of Western Europe were cowed into submission, and Leftist regimes came to power in each of them. However, with the larger Gross National Product, and thus, with the larger capacity to make war, the United States was in a better position to wage a prolonged war. The United States struck back in outlying areas, consolidating its gains in areas that, without a sufficient fleet, the Soviet Union could not maintain proper contact with. &#10;Of course, the question of decisive victory was quite impossible. Because the war had &quot;crept up&quot; upon the superpowers, there had been no nuclear exchange, and, so far, the threats to resort to nuclear warfare had remained unfulfilled. But, if either power should become directly threatened, the possibility that it would use nuclear weapons would become a near-certainty. Thus, both sides kept their military goals small. The United States hoped to use its greater war making capacity to wear down its opponent, while the Soviet Union attempted to use its overwhelming strength to achieve lightning victories in short campaigns.&#10;&#10;As the futility of the war became apparent, and the populations and their economies began to show signs of fatigue, the war gradually wound down to a sort of &quot;cold war&quot; stalemate, and, although there were thousands of miles of front lines, the unofficial orders of the frontline troops were not to provoke the enemy. And because of this unsatisfactory, but inevitable resolution, the responsible parties in the governments of both superpowers were overthrown, allowing for a gradual withdrawal of troops from the battlefields across the globe.&#10;&#10;This game is a simulation of a hypothetical conflict. It is played on a map that is a simplified terrain reproduction of the entire world. A grid of hexagons printed over the map is used to regulate movement much as the squares on a chess board. The pieces in the game represent the actual military units which might take part in such a conflict. The large numbers on the pieces indicate the relative strengths of these units. Each Player maneuvers his pieces on the map to engage those of the enemy. Battles take place when units are adjacent to enemy units. The total relative strengths of the units involved are compared. The attacking Player consults a simple probability table (the Combat Results Table) to determine the outcome of each battle. Then the other Player moves his units and conducts attacks. The game proceeds this way (for a specified number of turns) as the Players try to achieve the objectives set forth in the rules. No prior knowledge of history or military tactics is required to play the game &mdash; just a little ingenuity and common sense.&#10;&#10;World War 3 is basically a two-Player game (an Optional Rule provides for an independent Red Chinese command). Each Player moves his units and executes attacks on Enemy units in turn, attempting to fulfill the conditions .of victory. To move from one hex to another, each unit expends a portion of its Movement Allowance. Naval Transport and Amphibious Movement allows the transfer of land units across bodies of water. Combat is resolved by comparing the Combat Strength Points of opposing units and expressing the comparison as a difference (differential) between Attacker and Defender. A die is rolled and the outcome indicated on the appropriate (Land or Naval) Combat Results Table is applied to the units involved.&#10;&#10;Rules and map are similar to Dunnigan's (Global War: The War Against Germany and Japan, 1939-45) game.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 3 months&#10;Hex: 500 miles / 804 kilometers&#10;Units: Army/Fleet&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; four color mapsheet or Two 17.5 x 22.5&quot; mounted mapboards (Designer box version)&#10;Three dual-side printed countersheets (600 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 16-page World War 3 rulebook&#10;Two dual-side printed player air cards&#10;One 6-sided die&#10;One counter storage tray (Designer box version)&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 6 hours&#10;&#10;";1975;5.18413;3.25;2;2;360;12;Modern Warfare, Wargame
3585;Sorcerer: The Game of Magical Conflict;"Sorcerer is a fantasy wargame. Each player has an army consisting of Sorcerers, human infantry, and magical units (trolls, demons, and dragons). Sorcerers specialize in types of magic represented by 7 different colors. Sorcerer adds a twist to the old &quot;combat differential&quot; system (attack strength minus defense strength) by adding a circular system of combat bonuses based upon what colors of magic are attacking each other; Blue/Green/Yellow/Grey/Orange/Red/Purple with each color having a strong advantage over it's neighbor to the right (with Purple circling around to have power over Blue) and a disadvantage against it's neighbor to the left, with lessening combat bonuses the further away the color is from itself. Combat bonuses are also given based on map position as the hexes alternate colors of magic instead of representing physical terrain. Attacking from one's own color is good.&#10;&#10;Several different scenarios are included in the rulebook that range from 1 to 6 players.&#10;&#10;";1975;5.65556;2.6786;1;6;60;10;Fantasy, Wargame

Before beginning the game, players take some time to memorize the images on the cards in the circle, after which all the clue cards are turned over.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of a player's turn, s/he places the Sherlock card next to a card, then names the object on the card Sherlock is next to and turns the card over to check. If s/he is correct, s/he moves around the circle, in the direction of the arrow, the number of spaces specified by the number on the card. S/he then guesses the object on that next card; if s/he is incorrect, all the cards are turned over again for the next player. If s/he is correct, however, s/he continues moving the Sherlock card around the circle in the same fashion. If the Sherlock card lands at a card that is already face up, the player takes that card and her/his turn is over. A new card is turned over from the draw pile, everyone takes a moment to memorize it, all cards in the circle are turned over, and play resumes with the next player beginning their turn.&#10;&#10;The first player to collect 6 cards wins.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.24703;1.0923;2;5;20;5;Card Game, Children's Game, Deduction, Memory, Novel-based

3598;Tracks to Telluride;"Railroad game set in 19th century Colorado features an unusual board construction mechanism, apparently patented: four sheets are joined each at one corner and rotated out to fully display.  Crayons are used to draw narrow- and standard-gage track on the hex map. Income is acquired by contracting mines and by first entry into cities.  Interaction is provided in the form of lawyers, whose injunctions can stop opponents from blasting their way through difficult mountain passes.&#10;&#10;Advanced Tracks to Telluride (1995) is a ziplock bagged expansion game kit by John Bohrer, the resulting game lasting 6 hours.&#10;&#10;Colorado Rails is the cheaper tube version of Tracks to Telluride.

3601;MegaNation;"MegaNation is a game of worldwide power politics.  Each player runs a nation in a fantasy &quot;modern&quot; world.  Each nation controls one or more areas on the board and is defined by &quot;factors&quot; assigned each turn to various attributes: Population, Education, Industry, Military, etc.  The winner is determined by a formula at the end of the game (which occurs on a random turn) using these attributes.  Each turn consists of random events (generated by die rolls), followed by allocating of 8 new &quot;factors&quot; to their nation's attributes, followed by actions on the board.  There are strategic resources (oil, gold, coal, ore, and rare minerals) which affect the allocation of factors and/or movement on the board.  Combat can occur between nations using military factors from the nations' attributes, resolution done by drawing as many numbered chits for losses as there are opposing military factors.  These can be modified by die roll, if desired.  Negotiation between players for resources, military assistance, travel routes, etc., is highly encouraged and virtually required by the design of the game.&#10;&#10;From the designer October 24, 2009:&#10;MegaNation continues with Collegiate Edition 3.3 and a simplified &quot;Family Edition&quot; for the &quot;little and older folks&quot;!&#10;&#10;";1990;5.43333;2.0;2;8;180;0;Abstract Strategy, Economic, Modern Warfare, Negotiation, Political

3603;The Normandy Campaign;"The Normandy Campaign is a two-player game on the fighting in Normandy which occurred after the Allied D-Day landings of June 6, 1944.  There are two identical maps, one for each player each hidden from the other.  Hexes are 10km, each turn 3 days, counters are from regiments to divisions.  Each turn consists of multiple movement and combat phases for each player.  Movement into enemy territory is done by stating the hex you wish to enter.  The opposing player must state if he has a unit in that hex, if not movement succeeds and may continue.  If so, an attack may take place if desired, and may involve multiple units on both sides with the attacker coming from one or more hexes.  Units are only revealed during combat.  Combat losses are in steps (7-8 becomes 5-8, then 3-8, then 1-8, then elim, etc) and determined by dice on a CRT.  Supply, fortifications and air power rules are included.  Victory is determined per scenario and is based on liberating cities or for exiting the west edge of the map.&#10;&#10;This is in the same series with Operation Market Garden: Descent Into Hell&#10;&#10;";1983;6.43935;2.6842;2;2;240;12;Aviation / Flight, Nautical, Wargame, World War II

Originally published as a stand-alone game by Battleline, Dauntless was later (1981) republished by Avalon Hill as a gamette expansion for the game Air Force.  AH added rules for ships and anti-ship weapons, carrier operations, and rockets.&#10;&#10;From a Battleline catalog:&#10;&#10;DAUNTLESS takes our proven and popular AIR FORCE game system into the skies of the Flying Tigers, Samurai and the &quot;Black Sheep.&quot; The new airplane data charts let you put such renowned aircraft as the P-38 &quot;forked tailed devil,&quot; the incomparably nimble Zero, the aptly named Black Widow, and the awesome B-29 through their paces.  Other veteran war birds include the P-40, Corsair, Val, Kate, Frank, B-25, the SBD (Slow But Deadly) Dauntless, and many more.&#10;&#10;Rules cover all important aspects of the air war in the Pacific: machine guns and cannons, dive bombing, torpedo bombing, level bombing, glide bombing, depth charge bombing, strafing, massed bomber formations, light and heavy flak, fighters, bombers, kamikazes, radar, clouds, industrial targets, vehicular targets, and naval targets, and more.

3609;Crescendo of Doom: A Squad Leader Gamette;"An gamette for the Squad Leader series, concentrating on early WWII (1939-1941) and the units and countries most involved during that time (Poland, Belgium, France, etc).&#10;&#10;The thirty-six page rulebook is presented in programmed instruction format (as introduced in Squad Leader) to introduce its twelve new scenarios.  There are two new 8&quot; X 22&quot; mapboards, and over 1200 counters.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 10&#10;&#10;Mapboards: 6, 7&#10;Scenarios: 21 to 32&#10;&#10;&#10;(From the back of the box:)&#10;&#10;From the Nazi invasion of Poland, through the heroic defense of tiny Finland against the Russian behemoth, the blitzkrieg conquests of Norway and the Low Countries, the Battle of France, and the seizure of Greece, the player is struck by the despair of men and nations alike, as seen by the soldiers who vainly sacrificed their lives against a more powerful aggressor. This is Crescendo of Doom... a gripping game of tactical combat set against the seemingly invincible juggernauts of war-torn Europe. Setting the scene for the colossal struggle of the titans which will follow, Crescendo is, nonetheless, far more than a simple prelude to Barbarossa. While fur&shy;ther refining the innovations brought forth in its highly successful predecessors Squad Leader and Cross of Iron: A Squad Leader Gamette, Crescendo breaks yet even more ground in the realm of realistic tactical combat without disturbing the underlying basic simplicity of a universally acclaimed game system. Crescendo is a welcome extension for the Squad Leader enthusiast even before he [or she] contemplates a single new counter.&#10;&#10;But Crescendo of Doom offers far more than that. Complete armor, ordnance, and infantry units are provided for Poland, Belgium, Finland and a host of other minor neutrals, including Elite, Line, and Reservist formations for all nationalities. In graphic detail, far superior to any narrative account, you will see for yourself how the outnumbered German panzers defeated the superior armor of the French tanks. Experience personally the French frustrations brought on by radioless AFVs and one man turrets. There are no Panthers or T-34s... here it is the Mk III vs. the Char B, Somua, or Matilda.&#10;&#10;And Crescendo of Doom need not end in 1942 with our 32nd scenario. The entire British Order of Battle is presented for the whole of WWII, enabling fans of the Western Desert, Italian, or Normandy campaigns to design their own scenarios for those periods. Crescendo of Doom is more than just a game. When combined with Squad Leader and Cross of Iron: A Squad Leader Gamette, it provides the ultimate in a tactical gaming system which can be used to portray any company or battalion level action. Be forewarned! Crescendo is not an easy game. Do not attempt it unless you have first mastered Squad Leader and Cross of Iron: A Squad Leader Gamette.&#10;&#10;In each game you get: &#10;&#10;     520 double-printed 1/2&quot; die-cut counters representing the men and weapons that comprised the combatants of the Western Front; 1939&middot;1942. &#10;     704 double-printed 5/8&quot; die-cut counters representing the complete vehicular and ordnance Order of Battle for the British.

3610;Word Power;"Players take turns rolling and moving around a circular board (a la Monopoly) in an attempt to &quot;publish&quot; 10 books or obtain $100,000.  Each player starts with $20,000 and a hand of 4 cards, each with a word (&quot;Lethargy&quot;) and four other numbered words (&quot;1. potency, 2. mutability, 3. felicity, 4. vigor&quot;).  In the middle of the board are 4 numbered spaces, 1-4.  At some spaces on the board you are allowed to play antonyms, others synonyms.  You may play up to 4 cards with the proper type to an unfilled number space equal to the number of the appropriate word.  For example on the above card, 4. vigor is an antonym for lethargy and could be played in the #4 spot on the board if empty and you are on a &quot;play antonym&quot; space.  If on your turn you fill the 4th space you &quot;publish a book&quot; and clear all the spaces.  If a player plays all 4 cards from his hand in a turn he also &quot;publishes a book&quot;.  A player may also &quot;publish&quot; a book by passing the start space (&quot;Go&quot;).   If any player feels that a card has been played incorrectly he may challenge the play.  He states what he thinks the correct play is and &quot;bets&quot; $1000.  The playing player may then call or raise in increments of $1000, back and forth until called.  The person who is correct gets the money, and if the challenger is correct the challenged card is returned to the player's hand.  At the end of a player's turn he fills his hand back to 4 cards.  Other spaces on the board require a player to pay money, allow him to collect money, or require all players to pass cards from their hands to other players.&#10;&#10;";1963;4.66698;1.2222;2;8;60;10;Card Game, Dice, Word Game
3611;Backgammon 4;"A nice-looking variant for four players, by the same company that produced Four Player Chess.&#10;&#10;Picture a &quot;rounded square&quot; with six backgammon points on each side of the square, then add three new points in each corner. The board is reversible, with traditional backgammon on the reverse side.&#10;&#10;Regular backgammon rules apply for movement.  The setup is slightly different, since the points &quot;farthest away&quot; from your home court are used by another player, so those 2 stones start one unit closer to home.&#10;&#10;The major change is direction - that all players in a three or four player game are moving clockwise.  Evidently there is no way to set up four players with two running clockwise and two running reverse.&#10;&#10;There are variants listed, including team play where two players can have stones resting on the same point.  For two players on this board, each gets two sets of pieces.&#10;&#10;This game differs from Quadragammon in that there are four complete sets of stones and the board has additional points printed in the corners.  And its main difference, the all-clockwise movement.&#10;&#10;Contents - reversible board (4-fold), 4 sets of stones, 2 dice (!) and rules.&#10;&#10;";1980;5.70721;1.3333;2;4;30;0;Abstract Strategy, Dice

Each hex is 1/3 mile and each turn is 12-15 seconds.  Each aircraft also maintains a paper log throughout the game for altitude, weapons usage, throttle setting, speed, etc etc.  Each turn aircraft attempt to spot and/or lock on to opposing craft and move into firing position.  Radar search, lock on, and damage results are by CRT with 10 sided die.  Damage is by level (light, heavy, critical) and cumulative.  There are 30+ base aircraft types and all their variants and 30+ different missiles represented in the game charts.

3618;The World at War;"The World at War 1939-1945 was the first unofficial Axis & Allies expansion, published by Xeno Games.&#10;&#10;Many of the rule changes found in the later Axis &amp; Allies Revised &amp; Anniversary editions (such as the 2-hit battleships, &quot;1/2 battleship&quot; destroyers, artillery guns) were original innovations in The World at War, first published in 1990 with 238 playing pieces and a new 24&quot;x36&quot; map that added more territories. As an expansion, much of the 1984 edition of Axis &amp; Allies was needed to play this expansion.&#10;&#10;The World at War 1939-1945 2nd Edition, published in 1993, balanced some of the gameplay and added some new ideas but retained the same glossy 24&quot;x36&quot; color map and pieces.&#10;&#10;The 3rd Edition, published in 1996, continued to improve gameplay balance and added Atomic Bombs to the technology development. After developing A-bomb technology, players spend 6 IPCs to buy one, which must be delivered via a Heavy Bomber (also a required technology). Damage to a land or sea zone by an A-bomb eliminates 20 IPCs worth of enemy units and renders the territory desolate (-5 IPC value, with +1 restoration each turn for two turns), causing devastation to the economy as well as military of an opposing player.&#10;&#10;Now in its 4th edition, The World at War includes a hardback map (replacing the poster-paper map of earlier editions), with some minor rule revisions over the 3rd ed, and this is a mature game in it's own right with differences significant enough for any A&amp;A fan to appreciate, beyond all of the &quot;official&quot; editions published in recent years.&#10;&#10;There are new unit types, such as Destoyers, Paratroopers, SS Panzers and SS Panzergrenadiers, Russian Guards, Partisans.

3619;Chain Reaction;"This pure abstract strategy game is a relatively unknown work by Sid Sackson. Similar in some ways to his 1981 Spiel des Jahres winner, Focus, it is available commercially in a German edition, but can be played with materials improvised from a chessboard and checkers.&#10;&#10;From the translation: The players take alternate turns of up to five segments, trying to move game pieces from their home squares over the opposing goal line, in order to score points. After the first segment of a turn, only towers made of two game pieces may be moved. Each tower is broken down during its move, and one of its pieces may be used to build a new tower on another square. Intelligent use of this move technique can lead to &quot;nuclear chain reactions&quot;, in which up to five towers are involved. There must never be more than one tower on the board at one time. Any tower on the board must be moved during the following turn segment by the player whose piece is on top. The game ends with the achievement of an agreed-upon number of points.&#10;&#10;The game was originally published in 1989 in a tiny cardboard box by Ferdinand de Cassan. In 1990 it was published by Hexagames in their &quot;Exklusiv&quot; series, and later (1993?) by Abacus in their very similar Abacus wood box series.&#10;&#10;";1989;6.4625;2.0;2;2;30;8;Abstract Strategy

3622;eBay: The Card Game;"Each player is randomly dealt a set of &quot;Curios&quot; of categories: Vintage, Games, Etc, Electronics, Sports and Collectibles. Once you win an auction of the items that match each of your Curio cards you win the game. Item cards represent the items you can find for sale on the eBay website. During the game Item Cards are auctioned off to the highest bidder. There are 2 types of Bidding Cards: Money Cards and Action Cards.&#10;&#10;First the Curio Cards are dealt according to the number of players ... 3 or 4 players = 5 Curio Cards each ... 5 or 6 = 4 Curio Cards each. Second the Item Cards are dealt face up in a row ... 3 or 4 players = 4 Item Cards each ... 5 or 6 = 5 Item Cards each. Third, each player is dealt 5 Bidding Cards. One D6 die is then placed on each Item Card matching the number showing on the die to the Number of Rounds field on the item. Finally, each player rolls a die. The highest roll receives the &quot;Starter&quot; Card and goes first.&#10;&#10;One complete round of play consists of one turn per player and an Auction Update Phase. During each player's turn, they may perform any or all of the following actions in any order: 1) Draw hand back up to 5 Bidding Cards, 2) Discard one Item Card won on a previous turn to draw 3 Bidding Cards, 3) Either 3a) Play 1 Action Card and/or place 1 bid on an item, 3b) In lieu of placing a bid and/or playing an Action Card, you may discard as many Bidding Cards as you like. You redraw at the beginning of your next turn.&#10;&#10;When each player has taken a turn, The &quot;Starter&quot; Card passes to the left.  After this, starting with the first Item Card, the die on each Item Card is lowered by one. When a die reaches zero, the auction is finished and all bids are revealed. Players may, at this point, play Action Cards which are allowed during this phase.&#10;&#10;Action cards: Know Your Enemy, Bad Money Order, Tastes Change, Mass Amnesia, Offshore Financing, Lost Connection&#10;&#10;Cards played during Auction Update Phase: Expensive Shipping, Reserve Price, Bad Feedback&#10;&#10;You can change the length of the game by adding or subtracting the number of Curio Cards available.&#10;&#10;(Most of the above was taken directly out of the rules sheet that comes with the game. Personal note: Some of the Item Card titles and flavor text is pretty funny and some are just plain &quot;cute&quot;.)&#10;&#10;";2001;5.15;1.8571;3;6;45;10;Bluffing, Card Game

First as teams, then as individuals, players engage in a number of activities, including answering riddles, guessing items from a series of clues, guessing teammates' answers to Scruples-style questions, and Pictionary-like drawing competitions.  Winners obtain tokens representing survival items such as food and matches, which are useful for other challenges.&#10;&#10;During successive turns in the end game, players vote together on who should be expelled from the island.

3624;Drakon Expansion 1;"This expansion includes 48 new tiles to add to the basic game and a pawn representing the Drakon itself.  Some of the tile functions include Secret Passages (can move between them as if adjacent), the Escape passage (move your hero to it immediately after laying it down), Drakon's Bargain (buy a tile from the board into your hand), Base Structure (tiles attached to it cannot be altered), Small Chamber (blocks movement when occupied), Void (miss next turn, reappear anywhere on board turn after that), Tornado (must move 4 chambers on next move), and Summon Drakon (places the Drakon token on an empty chamber, subsequent landings allow you to move it up to 3 chambers; Drakon sends heroes back to the start less 1 gold.)&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;version compatibilityAlthough the package says that this expansion cannot be used with the first printing of the game (with a red dragon on the cover) and can only be combined with the second printing (with a green dragon on the cover), using it with the first printing is not that big of a problem.  The only difficulty is that the backs of the tiles will have different pictures, and of minor note is that the newer tiles are a little thicker than the old ones.&#10;&#10;Note that the expansion will not work with the newer Drakon (Third Edition) because it has larger tiles (measuring 2.5 by 2.5 inches), and the 3rd Edition doesn't really need it since it already includes some of the expansion tiles.&#10;&#10;";2002;6.62429;2.0769;2;6;30;10;Expansion for Base-game, Exploration, Fantasy, Maze

3626;Demons: The Game of Evil Spirits;"(from the instruction manual)&#10;&#10;Demons is a game of demonic conjuration and treasure hunting for one to four players based on the medieval and ancient manuscripts comprising the &quot;Lamegeton.&quot;  The players take the roles of magicians questing after treasure in medieval Armenia.  The &quot;mortal powers&quot; of Armenia automatically pursue the magicians whose major defense is their ability to conjure fearsome demons.&#10;&#10;(paraphrased from the Historical Notes section of the instruction manual)&#10;&#10;The basic story of the key of Solomon holds that when Solomon was building the first temple in Jerusalem, one of his workers was seized by an evil spirit.  The archangel Michael appeared and delivered to Solomon a magical ring which gave him the power to command all spirits.  Solomon commanded the spirits into a brass vessel, which he sealed and cast into a lake in Babylonia.  Solomon had foreseen the possibility of the demons being released again and had prepared a testament detailing the various rituals and instruments that could be prepared by any person to command the spirits once more.  This power was to have been used for curing disease and preventing harm, but when printed examples appeared again in the 17th century the emphasis had switched to the finding of treasure and personal gain by the magician instead.&#10;&#10;";1979;5.57403;2.0;1;4;120;12;Fantasy, Medieval, Wargame

3628;Freche Frösche;"&quot;Bold Frogs&quot; is a memory game where each player tries to be the first to fill their board with 10 frogs.  On their turn, they choose two frogs from 60 tiles placed face down.  If the two tiles are consecutive, they choose a third. If this too matches, they can place the three frogs on their board or keep trying to get more matches. If they miss, all frogs are returned to the table (a bit like Can't Stop).&#10;&#10;There is a also a variant for older children and adults that allows players to find matches solely to remove frog tiles form the game and make it impossible for others to complete their board.&#10;&#10;This is a good game and one that adults will like to play with children in the same way as Zapp Zerapp or Zicke Zacke H&uuml;hnerkacke.&#10;&#10;";2002;5.56053;1.0;2;6;30;5;Children's Game, Memory

The players need to get six different colored cars home to his or her parking lot. Moving  cars is done by rolling the special color die. If you roll a color of a car that you don't have, you simply take this car from the traffic jam area and places it on your parking lot. But if you already have a car of this color you must drive the car from your parking lot and give to the player on your left. If all the other players have a car of this color, you place it back in the traffic jam.

3632;Foodie Forest;"This Reiner Knizia concoction is a sort of a trick-taking game, but instead of everybody playing one card and seeing which one wins the trick, everybody takes turns adding cards until the total adds up to 10 or more and the player who added that card takes the whole pile.&#10;&#10;This can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on the player's goal for that particular round!  There are five rounds in the game and exactly five different goals to be fulfilled:  to take as many mushroom cards as you can, or as many pea soup cards, or as many onion cards, or as many chili pepper cards, or to take no cards at all.  (The pepper cards, incidentally, count minus 1 unless your goal for the round is to collect them.)  Goals are revealed simultaneously, so you may or may not be in competition with another player for the same cards during the round.  And you can't choose a goal you've already chosen, so things can get pretty tough especially on the last hand, where no matter what cards you're dealt, you *have* to go for whichever of the five goals you haven't done already.&#10;&#10;Since the game is always exactly five rounds, it lasts a good dependable half an hour every time.&#10;&#10;";2002;6.37731;1.4196;2;5;30;8;Card Game

3634;Iberos: Overlords of the Ancient Peninsula;"Extracted from consimworld.com:&#10;&#10;IBEROS is an operational simulation of low to medium complexity of warfare in the Ancient Peninsula. It is packaged in a slipcase box that includes one 60 x 52 cm map, 240 full-color die cut counters, one standard and scenario rules booklet, one historical commentary booklet, and two player aid cards.  Game turns are one year each: after collecting silver and/or receiving it from Rome, you can pay your troops, recruit tribal levies, and perform other administrative functions. After that comes the Operations Phase. During it, each force (one or more Field Armies, Tribal Levies, etc) can perform certain operations, using Operation Points (OP). These actions include combat, diplomacy (you can try to control any area through diplomacy), besiege cities, pillage, recruit mercenaries, or build colonies. At the end of the Operations Phase, forces retire to winter quarters.&#10;&#10;The most outstanding features of the game are the Prestige Point Level and the differences between Regular and Irregular warfare.  The Prestige Level (PP) simulates the prestige of the civilized armies (Punic, Romans, Sertorians) among the Iberian tribes, and the tendency of the latter to switch to the side that seems to be winning... Certain results of the CRTs add or decrease the PP level of each side. Then, if your PP level is above 2, you have positive die roll modifiers on the Diplomacy Table. And vice versa if your PP level is 0 or lower.  Leaders play a key role since their modifiers are applied to retreat before combat, diplomacy, all kinds of combat, operations, interception, etc. Leaders are rated for Military and Diplomatic skills (The highest is Sertorius, with +3 +3). Roman leaders (Praetors, one each for Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior) are changed randomly each year when they're elected by the Senate of Rome. If you have quality leaders, your chances of avoid/provoke combat are higher, and vice versa.&#10;&#10;The irregular, &quot;hit and run&quot; tactics of the inhabitants of the peninsula characterized the Roman conquest and were the cause why the Romans took 200 years to completely control all of Hispania. All combat units have Regular and Irregular Combat factors. The attacker can always choose which CRT he is going to use. The idea here was to simulate the asymmetrical war fought out between the Roman/Punic invaders and the native peoples. If you can impose your style of fighting, (the other can not avoid combat) then you have the edge over the enemy.&#10;&#10;The game is played in scenarios. There are 9, from the Punic reconquest of Iberia (237-221 BCE) to the Cantabria campaigns of Caesar Augustus (24-19 BCE). There are a set of common rules for all the scenarios, plus specific rules for each scenario. There are fast playing scenarios (such as the Roman Civil War, or the Cantabrian wars) that can be played in two-three hours, and other that take 6-10 hour of play (up to 17 turns, such as Cato's campaign of 195 BCE, or the II Lusitanian War).&#10;&#10;Each scenario has its own Random Events Table. Some of the Random Events included are: plague, Excellent/Bad Crops, Tribal Rebellions galore, bribing enemy mercenaries, Numidian rebellion (for the II Punic War scenario), Alliance with Mithridates (Sertorius War scenario), and more.&#10;&#10;Optional rules include assassination of enemy leaders (you must spend Operations Points and Treasury Points for that), Rivalry between Iberian tribes (The Romans took advantage of this to apply the &quot;divide and conquer&quot; routine), Mountain redoubts (Mons Vidius, Mons Medulius...), or troop upgrade.&#10;&#10;";2002;6.09694;2.9;2;2;360;12;Ancient, Economic, Political, Wargame

Planets and moons are used to modify the trajectory.&#10;&#10;There are a limited number of ships.  Most are limited in fuel, so making efficient use of gravity is important to reaching a destination.&#10;&#10;2nd edition came out in 1981.

3668;Tribbles Customizable Card Game;"A self-contained spin-off of the Star Trek Customizable Card Game from Decipher, Tribbles is a fairly straightforward card game where you are trying to empty your 7 card hand in order to score points (&quot;tribbles&quot;) that you have been able to play. Each card represents a certain quantity of &quot;tribbles&quot; (1, 10, 1000, or 10,000.) The game play follows a sequential order, with each player needing to play the next higher value of tribble out of his hand than the one played immediately before.  If no such card is held, the player must pass and draw a card from his personal deck. There are also optional effects on each card, some reminiscent of Uno (among them Skip and Reverse), that vary the play sequence, score some special points, or allow a player to discard a card. A round ends when either a player is out of hand cards or all but one of the players are out of cards in their deck. Only the player who goes out scores points for his Tribbles played that round. Five rounds make a game. The player who scores the most tribbles in those five rounds is the winner.&#10;&#10;The game provides four pre-constructed decks totaling 112 cards, which are color coded to fit a theme. These cards can be interchanged to create different decks. To make the game even more customizable, &quot;tribbles&quot; cards from the ST:CCG expansion set &quot;The Trouble With Tribbles&quot; are compatible with this game. These cards can increase the highest tribbles card to 100,000, plus add a new special ability (a bonus for collecting a specific set of cards) and different combinations than those included in the boxed set.&#10;&#10;Also included in the game are reference cards which list the makeup of each standard deck and explain what the special effects are. In addition, you get a scoresheet and even a small pencil.&#10;&#10;";2000;5.57983;1.4375;2;4;30;7;Card Game, Collectible Components, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Science Fiction

3684;Dragons: The Classic Game;"Played on a 5x5 square board, this Canadian game is subtitled &quot;The Classic Game&quot;, presumably because it is an orientally themed uber-variant of Tic Tac Toe.  Each of the 3x3 corner quadrants of board represent the different seasons, and the goal of the game is to get a row of three stacks of counters placed in one of the seasons.  Players alternate placement of counters on empty squares until such time as somebody gets three in a row in a season (or overlapping seasons).  When a row is formed, all single pieces in the involved seasons are removed, and the player's removed pieces are stacked onto the last played piece of his color.  One goal should always be to minimize stack sizes, because when you run out of pieces to play, you have to use up a turn reclaiming a non-critical stack from the board.  The first stack a player forms will of necessity be at least three high, but subsequent stacks can be held to two piece height due to the fact that stacks themselves are eventually used to help form rows, and only single pieces are removed to form new stacks.  First person to get three stacks within one season wins.&#10;&#10;";0;6.11538;1.0;2;2;20;8;Abstract Strategy

3716;Tractics;"Tracticts was created in 1971 by Mike Reese and Leon Tucker with contributions by Gary Gygax.&#10;&#10;Its theme was World War 2 Combat and it was published by Guidon Games in 1971 and republished by TSR, Inc. in 1975. Its combat style involved 1:285 scale micro armour miniatures. When it was first created it used the 1/87 scale miniatures that were common but this later changed.&#10;&#10;The game came as a boxed set containing three booklets illustrated by Don Lowry.&#10;&#10;Tractics was innovative when it was published due to the fact that it was the first game that was published using a 20-sided die.&#10;&#10;In 1968 Reese and Tucker, two members of the LGTSA, began play-testing rules for tank combat that would eventually form the core of Tractics. Gygax contributed some rules on infantry, covered in the second booklet, and the third booklet would cover additional topics such as airstrikes and the MODERN period (which at the time included rumors of the XM-1 tank).&#10;&#10;The players must first acquire the miniatures and build the terrain. Reese and Tucker were interested in an accurate simulation, and as a result the game provides data describing the rate of movement, thickness of armor, and rate of fire for the makes of tank in service from 1940 to 1970. The tanks in Tractics have a 30% chance to hit a target which in essence means rolling at least a 15 on the 20 sided die. The modifiers of battle apply depending upon several factors such as concealment. The game is consequently slower to conduct than a board wargame such as Tactics II. For miniature wargamers who felt that the amount of detail was excessive, Reese and Tucker recommended their earlier Fast Rules (1970) although that set covered WWII only.&#10;&#10;Tractics requires the use of a judge. Since players are unaware of their enemies locations, the pieces are placed on the map only when they are detected or they march to an open view.&#10;&#10;";1971;6.52292;4.0909;2;2;90;12;Miniatures, Wargame, World War II

3720;Subbuteo;"Subbuteo is a classic finger-flicking football-simulation action game.  It is played on a large cloth playing field called a &quot;pitch&quot;, with teams of miniature football players mounted on smooth round bases.  The football players are made to kick the ball by flicking their bases, which causes them to slide around on the pitch, hitting the ball.  The rules simulate nearly all details of a soccer game including ball possession and passing, throw-ins, goal kicks and corner kicks.  There is even a large section in the rules devoted to fouling.&#10;&#10;Far more popular in European countries than in the United States, this game allows collectors to buy teams of football players representing dozens of teams and countries from around the world, along with soccer stadium enhancements such as stands filled with cheering fans, referees that stand on the sidelines, even stadium lights.&#10;&#10;";1947;6.98068;1.781;2;2;20;6;Action / Dexterity, Sports

3728;Ker Plunk;"The game consists of a clear plastic tube, 30 thin sticks, and 32 marbles. Play begins with the players inserting the sticks through the tube and then pouring the marbles into the hole at the top of the tube. The sticks act as a web that block the marbles at the top of the tube. At this point, the players begin to carefully remove the sticks one by one. The goal is to get the stick out without making any of the marbles fall through. If any do so, the player who made them do so collects them. Once the last marble has fallen, players count their collected marbles, and the player with the fewest wins the game.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;    Toy Story Ker Plunk!&#10;&#10;&#10;";1967;4.7944;1.0364;2;4;20;5;Action / Dexterity, Children's Game, Party Game
3730;Statis Pro Baseball;"The Statis Pro baseball game includes individual pitcher and batter cards for an entire baseball season. A full 9-inning game generally takes 30 minutes or less to complete.&#10;&#10;Begin by choosing teams, pitchers, and line-ups. In order to simulate a real season, each player card indicates which positions a player is allowed to play, and for how many games that player played at each position during a full season.&#10;&#10;Each at-bat is simulated the same way. First, a Fast Action Card (FAC) is drawn to determine a PB number which is then compared to the PB rating on the pitcher's card; this determines if the pitcher&rsquo;s card or the batter&rsquo;s card is &quot;in control&quot;. Then a new FAC is drawn to generate a random number to determine the result from the player's card who was &quot;in control&quot;. Each of the 98 FAC has four results&mdash;two per side, one right-side up, one upside-down and also features special PB results to simulate clutch batting, clutch fielding, unusual plays (e.g. dropped third strike, ejections, etc.), and injuries.&#10;&#10;If an out is made, an out chart appropriate to the runner situation (e.g. Bases Empty, Runner on Second, etc.) is consulted to determine the outcome by drawing an additional FAC (or two, if the out result has a chance of error to be checked).&#10;&#10;Charts on the playing board support managerial choices such as sacrifice bunts, hit and runs, stolen base attempts, etc. For these, no PB number is determined; simply consult the FAC&rsquo;s random number and follow the chart&rsquo;s instructions which usually involves consulting players ratings appropriately (e.g. base runner&rsquo;s stolen base rating, catcher&rsquo;s throwing ability, etc.).&#10;&#10;Production of the game was halted after the 1992 baseball season on account of a royalties dispute between Avalon Hill and MLB. While the Avalon Hill Statis Pro Baseball game is no longer in production, it is possible to make your own player cards using the Statis Pro Baseball card formulas provided with the game. Moreover, PDFs of fan-made seasons and teams can be found online either free or for purchase.&#10;&#10;";1971;7.23307;2.1698;1;2;20;10;Card Game, Sports

3734;Biker Mice from Mars: Take Back the City;"Based on the cartoon series of the same name, Biker Mice From Mars: Take Back the City is a board game in which players take on the roles of the biker mice heroes.  The city has been overrun by criminals and the heroes are duty-bound to clear it up.&#10;&#10;The players take turns to play.  They use a spinner to determine the number of spaces they can move on the board.  Interspersed on the board are locations where the criminals have been randomly placed face-down (except for the boss, Lawrence Limburger, who is placed openly in his headquarters) and where they can draw Plutarkian Pothole cards, which grant positive or negative effects.  By moving their tokens onto criminals, the player engages them in battle, which is resolved by again using the spinner.  If victorious, the player takes (captures) the criminal's disc into his or her possession.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all criminals have been captured.  The players score the criminals they have captured (different points for the 6 types of criminals in the game).  The one with the highest points wins the game.&#10;&#10;";1994;3.6;1.0;2;4;30;6;Adventure, Science Fiction

3770;Caramba;"Caramba is a racing game for two players where each has a set of runners that are trying to make it to the finish and a set of hunters that attempt to stop the opponent's runners.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a board, 3 runner pieces per player, 4 hunter pieces per player, a card identifying each of the 6 runners, two dice and a set of rules.&#10;&#10;After all the pieces are in place, the game commences with the hidden selection of each player's &quot;favourite&quot; runner. This is done by placing the card representing this runner face-down but in an open location. Runners are distinguished by the colours of their sombreros. Rolling the dice, the players move either their runners or hunters around the multiple paths on the board. Taking care of special board spaces and certain limitations on movement, each player will be moving runners towards the end goal while trying to capture an opponent's runners with his/her hunters. When a hunter captures a runner, the player that was attacked reveals the hidden runner card. If the favourite was captured, the game ends. If not, a new favourite is secretly selected and the hunter must return to the start.&#10;&#10;The main goal is either to stop the opponent's favourite runner or to make it to the end with your own favourite.&#10;&#10;";1973;4.95833;2.0;2;2;20;0;Abstract Strategy

3778;Cannae;"Representing the historic battle of Cannae, this war game is played between the Roman and Carthaginian forces led by Hannibal. It attempts to recreate this famous battle which is arguably Hannibal's greatest victory.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one of the forces is eliminated or a set period of time passes (40 turns). With over 1000 pawns, each representing 30 cavalry or 80 men, it attempts to provide a clear sense of the carnage on the battlefield. The historic battle faced an estimated 50,000 romans against 40,000 Carthaginians.&#10;&#10;The game map is scaled at 1 square for each 25 meters, and each turn of the game equals 15 minutes of battle. During each turn the romans go first, then the Carthaginians, and the turns are broken into phases: movement, defensive placement, offensive placement, confrontation, recovery.&#10;&#10;Units are represented by two values, strength and movement.  Movement indicates the number of spaces that a unit can advance each turn if not engaged in combat. Strength is used in battle to determine combat resolution, in combination with die rolls.&#10;&#10;";1986;7.07143;2.5;2;4;240;14;Ancient, Wargame

3784;Die Schätze des Ali Baba;"The Treasures of Ali  Baba&#10;&#10;extrapolated from a review done by Kevin Whitmore&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game each player starts with a pawn in the bottom corner of the board. At the opposite corner of the board is the entrance to the cave. Every turn each player rolls a D6 to move. Players must move their pawns in a clockwise direction along the edge of the board upon a narrow track. At the left-hand corner is a space marked &ldquo;W&uuml;ste&rdquo; (Desert). Each pawn must stop there. To leave the desert a player must roll an odd number. Upon reaching the far corner players must pause on the corner before opening the mountain.&#10;&#10;The heart of the game happens within the cave. The cave is large, dominating the game mat. Up to 40 square cards can be placed face down, one per space, within the cave. This number will be reduced if the optional obstacles and tea light are used. The cards show the same back, depicting a vase. When a pawn ends its move on a vase the active player may inspect it, and claim the treasure shown. In addition, the player rolls a die to see if they break the vase. If not, they replace the treasure card with a blank card showing the same vase on the back. In this way the game board becomes depleted of treasures and filled up with worthless empty vases, or voids where vases were broken.&#10;&#10;Complicating the player&rsquo;s lives is the band of 40 thieves. Really it is just the black pawn, but he travels the board seeking to prevent the players from absconding with the treasures. Combat slightly favors the black pawn, encouraging all the players to give him a wide berth.&#10;&#10;As players collect more treasures, they become encumbered, and forfeit movement points as their load increases. This allows the black pawn to possibly catch a player&rsquo;s pawn. However, some of the treasure cards are empty backpacks and sacks, allowing a pawn to carry more treasure before becoming encumbered. Further, the black pawn is slow, rolling a special die with a top value of four.&#10;&#10;Once a pawn has escaped from the cave, he must continue clockwise upon the track along the edge of the board. At the right-hand corner is a space marked BAGHDAD. Each pawn must stop in Baghdad, and may only leave on the roll of an even number. Should the pawn fail to leave, one of its hard-earned treasures will be lost. Staying in Baghdad is expensive! Eventually the pawn will escape Baghdad, and travel back to the starting corner.&#10;&#10;To win the game the player must have more treasures than any other player, and they must also have more treasures than what remains within the cave.&#10;&#10;";1999;4.16667;0.0;2;5;60;8;Arabian, Novel-based

3792;Countermoves Generic Microgame Engine;"The CGME Core Rules are the basic building blocks that could be used to make a Microgame. Think of them as atoms. With just these core rules you will not be able to play much. What you can do with them though is build up Gameworlds that take the CGME Core Rules and fill in the details of the game setting you want to play.&#10;&#10;The Gameworlds are the source documents that will add the detail to the Core Rule's atomic structure. They will describe things like a worlds terrain, the units available, their strengths and weaknesses, the climate, special rules that modify combat resolution, new rules that cover things like horse back ridding, vector space ship movement, and just how to handle a Vogon star destroyer that has wandered into your Medieval Fantasy realm.&#10;&#10;By building off the same Core Rules and by using the Gameworlds you have created, or have been created by others, you can then build up Gamesets to cover the specific events to play out. For example, by using the CGME Core Rules coupled with the CGME Space Gameworld you could build a Gameset to play interstellar battles, trade wars across colonial star systems, early 1970's Soviet vs. US orbital conflicts, and many more.&#10;&#10;If a Gameworld does not cover all the details you need to play out your event, you are free to haul off and add in what you need, modify what is there and hopefully make it available so others can use it.&#10;&#10;CGME is freely available in Volume 1 Issue 1 of Countermoves&#10;&#10;";2001;5.0;0.0;2;2;20;12;Abstract Strategy, Dice, Miniatures, Wargame
3793;Pig Pong;"Pig pong combines the ever popular &quot;sport&quot; of ping pong with, well, plastic pigs.&#10;&#10;The contents are 1 net, 2 scoring tokens (shaped like pigs), 1 serving trough, 6 puff balls and 4 pigs.&#10;&#10;The general idea of the game is to have two teams, on either side of the plastic net, squeeze the plastic pigs. In doing so, the pigs act like bellows and push a very light &quot;puff&quot; ball towards the opponent. If the puff lands anywhere on one team's side, the opposing team receives a point. The puff is then placed on the serving trough (a mini-shelf on the net) and on the count of &quot;oink&quot; the teams bellow away again.&#10;&#10;First team to 11 points is the winner!&#10;&#10;";1986;5.7624;1.0;2;4;10;6;Action / Dexterity, Animals, Children's Game, Sports

3796;Trial by Pylon;"Welcome to the world of the Great Pylon, a world of Sorcery and Witchcraft, a world of Combat and Chivalry, a world of Monsters and Danger. Jovima the Mage is master of this mystical land. His many wonderful Treasures lie waiting throughout his realm, each guarded by a perilous adversary of unique powers. Jovima challenges each wayfarer to dare the Trial by Pylon, a trial in which you risk your very life to attain some of his wealth and powers.&#10;&#10;Whether you are a Novice, a Warrior, or a Sorcerer, the elements of chance are always testing your skills. A simple treasure hunt can easily become a fight for survival. Up to six players may confront Jovima in their quest for fortune.&#10;&#10;&mdash;publisher description&#10;&#10;An independently produced hack-and-slash fantasy card game. Per the rulebook, the first edition was limited to 5000 numbered copies. Some or all of these first edition copies were signed by the designer and artists. It does not appear any subsequent editions were published.&#10;&#10;Three &quot;levels&quot; of play are available: Novice, Warrior, and Sorcerer. The Novice level is a solitaire game that allows a player to become familiarized with the Location, Weapon, Treasure, and Peril (monster) cards. Warrior level challenges the players to be the one who escapes the realm with the greatest amount of treasure. To win at the Sorcerer level, a player must exit the realm with Jovima's four most precious treasures, thereby becoming an Adept at the Trial by Pylon.&#10;&#10;The game includes six characters, each of which has a special points advantage in regards to some or all of the &quot;Perils&quot; that will be encountered in the realm. Players switch to a different character if the one the player started with is killed off.&#10;&#10;Character, Weapon, Location, and Peril cards are randomly distributed at start, and during the game by drawing from the respective decks. Players use their character's special advantage, along with weapons possessed by the character, to overcome the peril found at a location in order to win the treasure being guarded by the peril. Combat is a straight comparison of the Power number for the weapon used by the character, plus any character bonuses, against the Strength value of the Peril card, adjusted for the Location when applicable (classes of monsters are stronger when in certain locations, or sometimes weaker). The Weapon card is discarded after use.&#10;&#10;Treasures can be used to buy weapons, and sometimes to bribe a peril. Escape cards allow a player to successfully avoid a peril, or perhaps end the Trial by Pylon - but beware the appearance of Jovima, who can bring your quest to a sudden conclusion!&#10;&#10;Trial by Pylon is not solely a dungeon-crawling adventure. The locations depicted on the cards range from wilderness venues, to rooms that might be found in a palace or castle, to elements of a cavern or dungeon complex - making the journey a varied, abstracted, and somewhat random one!&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;";1982;4.55286;0.0;1;6;60;0;Card Game, Fantasy, Fighting
3797;Grade Up to Elite Cow;"A promotional/educational game &quot;of skill and chance for Dairy Farmers&quot; made by Waddingtons of behalf of &quot;The British Friesian Cattle Society of Great Britain and Ireland&quot; as a fundraising exercise in which proceeds from the game went to the Y.M.A (Young Members Association) of the said Society.&#10;&#10;Players attempt to gradually &quot;grade up&quot; their mixed non-pedigree and pedigree dairy herd to achieve pedigree status in just three generations. The mechanism for doing so involves following the real life process of getting female offspring from an animal that is considered typical of the breed and showing no obvious signs of cross breeding (and thus qualified to be entered in the &quot;A&quot; Section of the Supplementary Register of the Herd Book maintained by the Society as ASR). These female offspring would be qualified to be entered in the &quot;B&quot; Section of the Supplementary Register as BSR cows, and their pure bred offspring would in turn qualify as CSR animals. The daughters of CSR animals can then be registered in the Herd Book proper and become full pedigree cows.&#10;&#10;Full pedigree animals that achieve certain standards of milk and butterfat production then can be entered into the Register of Merit (can carry the suffix RM) and an RM cow that has calved at least three times, had two yearly yields entered in the RM and has at least 76 point in Type Classification (out of 100 in a system of grading desired breed characteristics) in turn qualifies as an RMX standard cow (X for Excellent).&#10;&#10;RMX cows who achieve a lifetime milk yield of at least 50 long tonnes and have scored at least 85 point in Type Classification finally qualify to grade up to Elite Cow.&#10;&#10;The object in simplified game terms is to be the first player to grade up at least 4 cows (out of a starting 6) to that Elite Cow status and thus win the game.&#10;&#10;";1986;5.55556;2.0;2;4;60;10;Animals, Dice, Educational, Farming

3800;Himalaya;"As the Chief of a Himalayan high plateau tribe; Dolpo-pa, Bhotia, Sherpa, or Tamang, you lead your yak's caravan from one village to another through snowy crests and risky paths in order to collect the goods necessary to the development of your tribe.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, you will increase the political, religious and economical influence of your tribe. By collecting goods (salt, barley, tea, jade, and gold), you can make offers to monasteries, send out delegations to different regions or bargain to increase your livestock. All this to become the most prosperous caravaneer in all of the Himalaya!&#10;&#10;Players program their caravans around the paths on the Himalayan plateau to collect various goods, and then deliver them.  Each turn players plan in advance six moves for their caravan, trying to second-guess what other players will do to their best advantage.  Delivering goods allows the player to increase their influence in one of three separate categories - each delivery allows you to advance your position in two of the three categories.  Religious influence is marked by the number and value of your stupas in buildings on the board, political influence is marked by the number of sherpas you have in the regions between the paths on the board, and economical influence is marked by the total number of yaks you have on your delivery disks.&#10;&#10;The scoring is unique to the game, in the 4 player game anyway (the player count the game is primarily designed to be played with).  To determine the winner you first score up religious influence, and the player with the least religious influence is eliminated, and their remaining pieces are removed from the board.  Next the player with the least political influence is eliminated.  The remaining two players decide the winner by who has the greatest economic influence.  This unusual scoring is what makes this game different from many other similar games.&#10;&#10;";2004;6.98728;2.569;3;4;60;8;Economic, Medieval, Political
3801;When Darkness Comes;"When Darkness Comes is a tile-based board game that combines roleplaying with boardgaming.&#10;&#10;The first core set, called The Awakening, deals with the undead (zombies, mummies, vampires, etc).  The objective of the game will depend on the scenario. Some may include finding and defeating a big bad guy, finding a certain object, defusing a bomb, etc. The characters (pre-generated or created) have 7 attributes with specialized skills. That will determine the amount of dice rolled for a skill check. The mechanic for skill checks is a poker variation instead of using straight high roll. Players try to get 6 high, one pair, 3 straight, 3 of a kind, 4 straight, etc.&#10;&#10;Expansions&#10;&#10;     When Darkness Comes: The Horror Within (2002)&#10;     When Darkness Comes: Hell Unleashed (2002)&#10;     When Darkness Comes: The Darkness Before the Dawn (2003)&#10;     When Darkness Comes: The Most Dangerous Game (2003)&#10;     When Darkness Comes: This Is Not Happening (2004)&#10;     When Darkness Comes: The Nameless Mist (2005)&#10;&#10;&#10;";2002;5.57476;2.449;1;6;90;10;Dice, Horror, Zombies

3804;Slamwich;"Slamwich is a real-time, pattern recognition card game such as Twitch, Set, and Bongo, with cards that are die-cut to resemble slices of bread topped with sandwich items, sandwich thieves, and sandwich munchers.&#10;&#10;To play, deal the deck out as evenly as possible, then set any remaining cards aside. One by one, each player takes the top card of her deck and flips it onto a central pile. Under certain conditions, players race to slap the pile &mdash; creating a &quot;slamwich&quot;, if you will &mdash; and typically whoever is first to do so claims all of the cards in the pile. These conditions are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    If the flipped card is identical to the card directly underneath it (a &quot;double decker&quot;), slap the pile.&#10;    If two identical cards have exactly one card in between them (a &quot;slamwich&quot;), slap the pile.&#10;    If a thief is placed on top of the cards, slap the pile.&#10;    If a muncher is revealed, the next player flips as many cards as the number on the muncher card. If she fails to turn over a muncher card, the previous player claims all of the cards; if she creates a slamwich or double decker, or she plays a thief, then everyone races to slap the pile.&#10;&#10;&#10;If a player runs out of cards, she's out of the game.

The player assumes the role of a fire boss and must decide the most effective way of fighting a forest fire - both in terms of tactics used and value lost. Fire growth is governed by the game system with wind and fuel moisture content as the driving forces. The goal of the player is to contain the fire while keeping costs low and still be able to get home in time for supper.&#10;&#10;";1996;6.68143;2.3333;1;1;90;12;
3809;Harvey Smith's Show Jumping;"In Show Jumping, up to 4 players attempt to run their horse through a series of jumps, in the least amount of moves. Dice rolls are used to determine movement, but each player can maneuver their horse to the best possible point to attempt a jump. Jump cards can also be obtained and held, which can help a player go over a particularly hard jump. The jumps on the board can be set up in many different configurations, to make many different courses. The game can also be played solitaire, with the lone player attempting to complete a course in the fewest possible moves.&#10;&#10;";1974;4.0;0.0;1;4;45;8;Racing, Sports
3810;Gusher;"Gusher is the direct ancestor of Oil Power and King Oil and is similar in concept. The board is a hollow box with irregularly shaped wooden spacers between the top and bottom. The game board is shaken during the game setup to randomize the location of the wooden spacers (oil deposits). The playing surface is divided into 60 real estate parcels, each of which has from one to 10 drilling sites. Players bid to lease parcels, and once they acquire one or more leases, they may drill on their leased tracts at a cost of $10,000 per hole.  This cost of drilling is lost if the result is a dry hole, but there is a large payoff for successful wells (&quot;gushers&quot;). Players begin with a stake of $300,000. The game ends when a player accumulates $1 million.&#10;&#10;Although the game is largely a contest of luck, there is some strategy. Successful wells tend to be clustered. Thus tracts that are contiguous to parcels on which there are successful wells are more highly valued. Furthermore, because gushers produce revenue for the owner with each turn, successful wells obtained early in the game are considerably more valuable than those obtained near the end.&#10;&#10;Play proceeds in turns, and each player upon his turn may designate one or two unleased tracts for bidding or he may choose to drill if he has previously acquired one or more leases and has undrilled sites.  Players may sell or trade leases and drilling sites, and they may form partnerships to acquire leases or share the cost of drilling.&#10;&#10;In a typical game setup, approximately 15% to 20% of the drilling sites will be gushers. A game generally requires about 20 complete turns.&#10;&#10;Early 1940's editions employ a 20.5&quot; x 20.5&quot; game board; these feature boxes with deep, dark colors and silvered print. Later editions employ a 15.25&quot; x 15.25&quot; game board and light colored boxes with black print.&#10;&#10;Game Contents: game board, General Information and Rules, Gusher Game Money, metal drilling derrick, round cardboard markers for leased tracts, round cardboard markers for dry holes, and round wooden &quot;tanks&quot; to collect oil from successful wells.&#10;&#10;";1946;6.05;1.5;2;4;60;10;Industry / Manufacturing

3814;Desert War: Tactical Warfare in North Africa;"Desert War: Tactical Warfare in North Africa, 1940-43, is an historical simulation of the tactical Combat in North Africa from 1941 to 1943.  The scenarios show several common situations involving German, British and Italian Units.  The combination of situations with varying forces allow an almost innumerable amount of different scenarios to be played.&#10;&#10;Desert War is basically a two-Player game. It is played in sequenced turns, during which the Players use a new &amp; unique simultaneous plotting and moving system to move their units on the map, have combat and attempt to achieve certain objectives. The game is played in Scenarios which are various mixtures of forces and objectives.&#10;&#10;The Western Desert, stretching 1,400 miles between Tripoli and Alexandria, was described by one German general as &quot;a tactician's paradise and a quartermaster's hell.&quot; Between March 1941, when Rommel's Afrika Korps arrived in Tripoli, and May 1943, when the last Axis troops surrendered in Tunisia, the conduct of the Desert War furnished the proof for that general's impression.&#10;&#10;Desert War is a tactical simulation designed to recreate the mechanized struggles which took place in the &quot;perfect&quot; tactical terrain of North Africa during World War II. The 22&quot; x 34&quot; two-color mapsheet depicts a composite desert battlefield on which the flat sands are sparsely interrupted by patches of rocky cover or slight differences of elevation. Each mapsheet hex represents a hundred meters of distance and each Game-Turn represents three and a half minutes of actual time. Four hundred die-cut units represent the Allied, German and Italian combat units that contest the differing Desert War situations and scenarios. Opposing infantry companies, supported by tank platoons and anti-tank and artillery batteries engage each other within the tactical game scale of Desen War.&#10;&#10;Desert War is a tactician's simulation tool. Those of you who have been following this series from PanzerBlitz and Combat Command: Tactical Armored Warfare, France 1944 through Red Star/White Star: Tactical Combat in Europe in the 1970's,  know that Desert War is a development of game you won't want to miss.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 3.5 minutes&#10;Hex: 109 yards / 100 meters&#10;Units: Platoon to Company&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; two-color map&#10;One single-side printed countersheet (400 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 10-page folded rulebook&#10;One Simultaneous Movement Plot pad&#10;Two Scenario &amp; Tables players aid sheet&#10;One 6-sided die&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Low&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2-4 hours&#10;&#10;";1973;5.69107;3.125;2;4;180;12;Wargame, World War II

However, there are interesting movement rules - no jumping over other followers; landing exactly on another gets another move, or sometimes a chance to steal a gem. There is also a hand management aspect, as to collect a gem, you have to have a card for it. Card swapping is done by getting a follower to the right place.

3818;Alias;"Alias consists of many cards, each card has 6 words written on it. Each word has a number, from 1 to 6. Words are various - from very easy to very hard. Some are made of several words defining one thing (example: &quot;Silver Medal&quot;). There is also a board with tiles. Each tile is marked with number from 1 to 6.&#10;&#10;Alias is played in teams, usually in teams of 2, but more people are also allowed. The &quot;explainer&quot; must change every turn. Each team gets a figure representing them on the board. Their goal is to get through the board. Each time a figure stops one team member must take cards from the pack (not showing it to the other team member(s)) and explain the words on every card that have the same number as the space their figure landed on. The hourglass (also included) is set just before the team member starts explaining the word. (Looking at the first card and thinking about how to explain the word before the time is set is allowed.) The Player must get the other team member to say the  word that is written on card  by using sentences to describe the word.  For example, if the word is &quot;Silver Medal&quot;, a player can say &quot;something that a sportsman wins at the Olympic games&quot;. But if other team member says just &quot;Medal&quot;, it isn't correct. Then the first player must further define what the hint might be. Second player can answer as often as he/she wants until the time runs out. If time runs out or first player accidentally uses the word which is written in card, the team loses a turn. Variations: opposites and/or foreign words are allowed.&#10;&#10;Based on Alias' success, Tactic has kept publishing re-implemented versions of the same basegame, such as Fame Alias, Junior Alias, Junior Alias: Travel, Muumi Alias, Family Alias,  Party Alias,  High School Musical Party Alias, and has also licensed Noteability as Musiikki Alias.&#10;&#10;Tactic gives the official launch year of Alias as 1991, but the first edition was actually available already in 1990 and a limited release of the game may have been issued as early as 1989.&#10;&#10;Expansions in the form of additional decks of cards have been published since the early 1990's.&#10;&#10;";1990;5.94121;1.2551;4;12;60;7;Party Game, Trivia, Word Game

3820;Star Fleet Missions;"This has been called &quot;a variant of Top Trumps set in the Star Fleet Universe,&quot; though it's closer to Whist because the trump suit is selected before the cards are.&#10;&#10;Each round a mission card is read, including winning criteria (see below). Each player then secretly commits a ship card to it from their hand of five.  The winner of the round is the player whose ship best meets the mission's criteria.&#10;&#10;Ships are rated for Space Combat, Marines, Diplomacy, Science, and Cargo.  Most missions will only use one of these (i.e., &quot;highest Space Combat wins&quot;) while some use two combined (i.e., &quot;highest total of Science and Cargo wins&quot;).  A few missions add special conditions; ships sent to defend against Gorn attack may not be Gorn, for example, while the Romulan Civil War excludes all but Romulans, and negotiations with alien pacifists go to the highest Diplomacy after Space Combat and Marines are subtracted.&#10;&#10;From the rule sheet cover:&#10;&#10;Star Fleet Missions is a card game played with two decks of cards:  Ship Cards and Missions Cards.&#10;&#10;Each Ship Card represents a starship.  there are 18 cards for each of six &quot;races&quot; (Federation, Klingon, Romulan, Gorn, Tholian, and Orion Pirate), for a total of 108.  (Race means &quot;nation&quot; or &quot;empire.&quot;)&#10;&#10;Each Ship Card shows the class (type of ship), the name of the specific ship, and five Ratings which are used to determine the suitability of a ship for a given Mission.  These Ratings vary from 1 to 16.&#10;&#10;The other two Ship Cards represent starships with Legendary Captains and are the most powerful Ship Cards in the game.  All five Ratings are 20!&#10;&#10;Each Mission Card describes an exciting mission on which you will send one or more starships.  Each Mission Card describes the Mission, tells how many ships to send on the Mission, provides any special instructions, and describes how to &quot;win&quot; that Mission (i.e., which Ratings of the ships sent will be used to determine which ship performed the best.)&#10;&#10;";1992;4.65738;1.2143;2;6;60;10;Card Game, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Science Fiction, Wargame

3823;Scandal;"Scandal is a card game designed by Edi Birsan and produced with images provided by Nina Hartley a well known adult actress of the decade.  The game was inspired by the Clinton-Lewinsky sex scandal and the design is a satire of that and all other scandals in history.  The cards are divided into categories, each representing elements of a good public scandal:  the Target, the Trigger, the Transgression, the Trumpeters (media), the Tidbits, and the Testimonials.&#10;&#10;Players take turns adding a card to the growing scandal.  Only one target, trigger, and transgression may be in play at any given time, and each is required for a complete scandal, but multiple cards from other categories may be added freely.  When the three required elements are present, a player may trigger a scoring round by playing one of two &quot;It's History!&quot; cards.  Scandals are thus generated until one player reaches a target total score.&#10;&#10;The 54 cards are each marked with standard playing card rank and suit (to allow use for traditional card games), and many sport photos of nude or scantily clad women (the box carries a &quot;not for sale to minors under 18&quot; warning).

3826;Unlur;"Unlur, the winner of the 2002 Unequal Forces Game Design Competition (sponsored by About Board Games, Abstract Games Magazine, and the Strategy Gaming Society), is an abstract strategy game played on a hexagon-shaped tessellation of hexagons with eight hexagons on each side.&#10;&#10;Unlur is also a game of unequal forces -- each player has a different objective. Black wins if 3 non-adjacent sides are connected, white if 2 opposite sides are. Thus black's goal is harder; to compensate, black will begin with some pieces already on the board. Initially, players do not yet have assigned colors; they take turns each placing a black piece on an empty hex. Either player may instead pass to become black (when they feel black has enough pieces on the board); the other player becomes white and places a white piece, and they continue alternating turns placing their own color. Black wins by forming a Y (connecting 3 non-adjacent sides) but loses by connecting 2 opposite sides without a Y. Likewise white wins by connecting 2 opposite sides but loses by forming a Y without connecting 2 opposite sides.&#10;&#10;";2002;7.50341;3.0;2;2;20;0;Abstract Strategy, Print & Play

However, technical progress was due not only to the ever-growing traffic network, but was accelerated by the construction of more and more powerful locomotives.&#10;&#10;Locomotive Werks is an economic game in which players purchase the ability to produce engines, pay workers to produce them, and sell to the volatile, dice-driven market. The game is best known for its unique market mechanism in which the demand for older train models dries up, often at a rapid pace as new technology is implemented.&#10;&#10;";2002;6.77275;2.8936;3;5;120;12;Economic, Industry / Manufacturing, Trains

3830;Doctor Who: Battle for the Universe;"DOCTOR WHO - BATTLE FOR THE UNIVERSE&#10;&#10;Summary&#10;Doctor Who, Battle for the Universe, is a game of battles and challenges for two, three, or four players. One player takes the part of The Doctor, and the others become one of his three arch enemies, i.e. Davros, The Master, or the Cyber Controller. Each of these characters has a team of four followers, Davros and four Daleks, The Doctor and his assistants, etc. There are also many other characters in the game that may be recruited. By collecting these characters each player tries to build a powerful team. By a series of battles and challenges, players fight for control of the universe until only two players remain and a final great battle decides the victor.&#10;&#10;Characters&#10;There are four main characters in the game, each having a team of four loyal assistants. These are: 1) The Doctor and his four assistants, Tegan, Ace, Romana and K9; 2) Davros and four Daleks; 3) The Master and his evil Time Lords, Morbius, Borusa, Omega and Rani; 4) The Cyber Controller with four Cybermen.&#10;&#10;The remaining cards comprise three Ice Warriors, three Mutants, two Marshmen, The Black Guardian, Linx, Shockeye and Garron. Each card lists the character's &quot;Inner Force&quot; (his inherent strength), and a list of weapons and devices with which he is skilled.&#10;&#10;Set Up&#10;Each player rolls the die -  the highest scorer becomes The Doctor, and takes the character card of The Doctor and places it in front of them. The other players, in order of score, select one of the main characters. The Doctor takes the four white counters - these represent his four regenerations, or lives. The other players take the appropriate colored counters. The Master - black, Davros -  red, etc. Place the silver counter on the ring at the top of the board. (The ring of weapons and devices) on the space marked by the Magic Recorder. The Doctor can then place ONE of his white counters on any one of the Tardis spaces on the three main movement rings on the board. The other players can now place their counters on any of the Hyperspace squares on the board, though not on the same space as another player. The other character cards are left in the box for easy access during the game.&#10;&#10;Movement (always clockwise) is determined by rolling the die. You can move from one ring to another as long as it does not involve an anti-clockwise movement. You land on spaces that allow you to take certain actions: collect a character, hyperspace to any other hyperspace square, Battle Zone 1, 2, or 3. You select a character for battle and the silver counter is moved based upon a die roll, thus selecting your weapon for the battle.&#10;&#10;The ring of weapons and devices is only used during battle and challenges.&#10;&#10;The rules contain sections for &quot;How to play with 3 Players&quot; and &quot;How to play with 2 Players&quot;&#10;&#10;";1989;4.72396;1.0;2;4;45;10;Abstract Strategy, Adventure, Dice, Fantasy, Fighting, Movies / TV / Radio theme

3833;Takeover: The Stock Market Game;"Takeover is a stock game with simulations of standard market mechanics and an additional twist of &quot;hostile takeovers&quot;. Players must build up their financial portfolio by risking money on long or short selling, playing the variations in the market, using margins and generally speculating. Players roll and move around a Monopoly-type board, with landing spaces and card draws giving various options. The board features an outer track where stocks can generally be purchased, and an inner criss-cross track where gambles and takeovers predominate. Purchasing of stock is unlike standard Monopoly exclusivity: when landing on a square, the active player may purchase up to 40% of available stock, and then all other players may also purchase stock. Disclosure rules generally limit ownership levels except for takeover situations. Typical brokerage mechanisms such as longs, shorts, margin calls, warrants, Futures, dividends, etc. are incorporated into the game.&#10;&#10;The game comes with three difficulty levels, with the goal of the full-difficulty-version involving acquisition of shares in every company in one of the four &quot;market groups&quot; and absolute majority of one of the companies in that group.&#10;&#10;This game was endorsed by the Toronto Stock Exchange.&#10;&#10;";1980;6.17273;2.0;2;8;120;0;Bluffing, Economic

3836;Legend of the Burning Sands;"A collectible card game (CCG) set in the world of Rokugan (the same as L5R) that has got a definite Middle-eastern feeling to it. Think of 1001 nights and you got it. Everything in the game centers on Medinaat al-Salaam, the Jewel of the Desert, a sprawling city where different factions vie for control. As of the Awakening set there are 12 factions in the game. A very short description of them:&#10;&#10;Assassins &ndash; You guessed it, assassins. ;)&#10;Moto &ndash; Mongols, likes to raid&#10;Senpet &ndash; Ancient Egyptians&#10;Ashalan &ndash; Immortal alien star gazers&#10;Qabal &ndash; Rebellious Jinn summoners&#10;Ebonites &ndash; Crusaders&#10;Jackal &ndash; Evil cultists&#10;Celstial Alliance &ndash; Djinns and more djinns&#10;Dahab &ndash; Merchants faction&#10;Ivory Kingdom &ndash; Evil Indian Cult&#10;Ra&rsquo;Shari &ndash; Romani&#10;Yodatai &ndash; Latin Romans&#10;&#10;The city and the river that runs through it is the only source of water in the desert and thus the one who controls the city and the water controls the desert. The city is ruled by the dread Caliph and her (yes, she&rsquo;s female) semi-undead followers. Much is going on in the city and the story evolves through the sets.&#10;&#10;There are four sets all in all and each set had a &quot;bug&quot; on them to make it easy to identify what set a certain card came from. The &quot;bug&quot; is a small symbol in the lower right corner of the card just in front of the Illustrator name. Faction included in that set listed as well:&#10;&#10;Shadow of the Tyrant (156 cards) &ndash; No marking being the first set. (Assassins, Moto, Senpet)&#10;Secrets and Lies (104 cards) &ndash; A small Maltese cross. (Ashalan, Qabal)&#10;Black Hand, Black Heart (104 cards) &ndash; Four small rectangles. (Ebonites, Jackal)&#10;The Awakening (464 cards) &ndash; A new moon. (Celestial Alliance, Dahab, Ivory Kingdoms, Ra&rsquo;Shari, Yodatai)&#10;&#10;These markings are hard to spot on some cards. To confuse things, several cards were printed in all or at least several sets even though they are only listed under the first set they were included in.&#10;&#10;";1998;7.00383;2.6667;2;6;60;10;Card Game, Collectible Components, Fantasy

Can you remember the numbers on the other players' cards? Can you keep a poker face, but notice when another player looks pleased? Sharpen your memory and your timing, and have fun with the cool cats and bad rats of Rat-a-Tat Cat.  This is the Gamewright version.&#10;&#10;1996 Mensa Select&#10;&#10;Republished 2002 by Amigo as Biberbande:&#10;&#10;Biberbande is a card game for Ages 6 and up, the object of which is to improve your initial unknown 4-card hand so that you have a lower sum of cards than the other players. There are 66 cards in the deck, which consists of ranks 0-9 (four of ranks 0-8 and nine 9's) and 3 different types of action cards (9 &quot;Exchange&quot;, 7 &quot;Spy&quot;, and 5 &quot;2 X draw&quot;). Four cards are dealt face down to each player so that no player knows the values of her cards. The four cards are then arranged in a row and each player may briefly look at her outer two cards. A player's turn consists of drawing a card from the top of the draw pile or discard pile. If the player drew from the draw pile, there are several possible actions: If it is a number card, she may replace one of her face down cards with it (placing it face down) or she may simply discard it. If it is an action card, she may carry out the action or ignore the action. If a player draws the top card of the discard pile, she must replace one of her face down cards with it (placed face down). A player may knock at the end of her turn meaning that each other player has one more turn before the round is over. When the round ends, players turn over their cards and add up their values. The player with the lowest total value wins. Generally the game is played with as many rounds as there are players. Player interaction comes in the form of the action cards. The 'Exchange' card allows a player to exchange one of his cards with one of his opponents. The 'Spy' card allows a player to look at one of his own cards. Finally the &quot;2X look&quot; card allows a player to look at the top card of the draw pile, then keep it or throw it away. If she throws it away, she must use the next card in the draw pile.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.25859;1.1164;2;6;10;6;Animals, Card Game, Children's Game, Memory

The objective is to destroy the enemy headquarters (HQ).  To go on the offensive, deployed units have to be ordered with maneuver cards, which direct the attack along one of three terrain cards between the players.  The defender can freely choose among his deployed units to meet the attackers on that terrain.  The outcome of the resultant combat depends on the influence of the terrain card, the involved units and their attached equipment.  If the attack is not defended against, the attackers inflict damage on the HQ.&#10;&#10;The game ends in a victory to the attacker when he or she has inflicted enough damage (typically 20) to their enemy's HQ.&#10;&#10;";1995;4.49524;1.8571;2;2;60;12;Card Game, Collectible Components, Modern Warfare, Wargame

3849;Red Zone;"A collectible card game (CCG) where players take the part of an owner/coach of a professional (United States) football team and play a football game vs each other.&#10;&#10;It uses a built play deck reminiscent of other CCG games, and that same play deck is used as both a timer and an indicator of results for the games called offensive and defensive plays.&#10;&#10;The opponents match decks versus each other, as well as a lineup of face-up starters on each side of the &quot;ball.&quot;&#10;&#10;Each coach calls a play simultaneously, and results of the combination of the plays and the performance of the individual player(s) involved are checked also.&#10;&#10;The Play wheel chart makes this quite efficient.  Base gamers, who do not have this wheel are left to consult a chart which cross-references the results.  The Play wheel streamlines the game--and decreases the down time significantly.&#10;&#10;The game is played in quarters like in regular football, timed by the use of a time-deck.  Coaches can implement double-teams, and run trick plays versus the other.&#10;&#10;The offensive plays available in the expansion set was significant to opening up the play books for each coach, including never-before-seen plays on both sides of the ball.  Additionally, certain players were hybrid players.&#10;&#10;The most notable of these was the Kordell Stewart card which we used to call &quot;slash&quot; like his on the field nickname:  Because he is a QB/WR/RB, and has stats which are superlative for all three positions.  This makes him a valuable asset to any team.&#10;&#10;Special Rare and Ultra-Rare cards allowed special abilities or results to be played from the hand of either coach, assisting in particular offensive and defensive plays.

3855;Crimson Skies;"Crimson Skies is a character-based board game of dogfighting and dive bombing in an aviation-dominated world; a simple, fast-playing game of pulp-fiction-style air combat.  It is a game about the men and women who pilot flying nightmares, the metal-sheathed birds of prey that spit death from the sky.&#10;&#10;In Crimson Skies, you are at the top of the aviation food chain - a fighter pilot, one of the fearless men and women who take to the skies each day for honor or profit.  Each player generates a minimum of two characters, a pilot and his or her wingman.  If your characters survive from mission to mission, they gain experience that can translate into better skills, and thus even better chances for future survival and success.  While this is a combat board game, not a roleplaying game, telling tales about your characters will invest the game with action, drama and humor, making the game-playing experience even more enjoyable.&#10;&#10;";1998;7.15973;2.9333;2;2;180;12;Aviation / Flight, Collectible Components, Miniatures, Wargame

Each side has nine short cylinders, eight large cylinders and one &quot;master&quot; large cylinder.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to capture your opponents MASTER.(That is a wooden token). You do this by rolling the dice and move your counters the given numbers of squares according to the movement rules.

This simple game (Ages 8 and up) is part of the then successful James Bond franchise of Victory Games. It was an attempt to create a simple 2-player game which would also appeal to kids (in contrast to their more complex efforts like the faulted &quot;James Bond Assault Game&quot;). It is basically the race from the movie &quot;Live and let Die&quot; - James Bond uses a motorboat to escape the evil henchmen of Kananga. Simple Action-System with small stand-up-boats and an abstract and slightly boring (small) board. Not a total waste of time - it actually works as a fast 2-player game.&#10;&#10;";1985;5.46667;1.2;2;2;45;8;Adventure, Dice, Fighting, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Nautical, Novel-based, Spies / Secret Agents
3864;Mechwarrior: Dark Age;"Mechwarrior: Dark Age is Wizkids Games continuation of the BattleTech property.  Jordan Weisman has tasked his design team with using the click-dials used in Mage Knight/Mage Knight Dungeons/Hero Clix to present a system of combined arms warfare in the BattleTech universe.  The system encourages use of Battlemechs, vehicles, and infantry to conquer your opponent.  The vehicles and infantry have dials similar to Mage Knight figures, with some new symbols to indicate new game mechanics.  Vehicles have long bases, like the mounted units.   Battlemechs use larger dials and include a heat dial which modifies three of the stats as the mech performs more actions.  The final result, while similar to Mage Knight is much more, using the simple action based system and dials, and bringing a new form of wargaming to the table.&#10;&#10;";2002;6.30896;2.7073;2;10;60;10;Collectible Components, Dice, Miniatures, Science Fiction, Wargame

3870;7 Ages;"7 Ages is a game of world history from 4000 BC/E to 2000 AD/CE. Players represent dynasties that decide the fate of the world across the millennia.&#10;&#10;You, as a dynastic head of one or more empires must guide your empires through history gaining glory points for historical, scientific, religious and cultural advances as you increase their health, wealth and prestige. All the leading figures of history are included, as they attempt to influence events and their society through their great words and deeds.&#10;&#10;Players can play multiple civilizations simultaneously (though the counter set limits the total number of civilizations that can be in play), but the first civilization card played determines the time frame in which the game starts, restricting which additional civilizations may actually be played and/or what historical leaders civilizations in play may use. This makes the secret bids to get the first move important to all players.&#10;&#10;The game features playing cards that represent either a historical civilization, an action, or a civilization advance, depending on the context in which the card is played. Each card also has a numeric value, used for making bids and trading. The game also features a system of a limited number of action options per player based on chits secretly selected by players each turn -- for example, if you are playing more than one civilization, only one can declare war, only one can take production, etc. There is a &quot;wild&quot; chit each player can use to let two of his or her civilizations take the same action, but the civilization using the wild chit pays a penalty.&#10;&#10;Victory points and civilization levels are plotted using an on-board scoring area. Game play can be quite long with more than two or three players, so most games end at a predetermined time or turn with the player with the most victory points from all his or her civilizations combined winning.&#10;&#10;";2004;7.09019;3.9254;2;7;480;14;Age of Reason, Ancient, Civilization, Medieval, Modern Warfare, Napoleonic, Pike and Shot, Renaissance, Wargame
3871;Factories;"In Factories the object is to collect at least one of each of the ten resources. This is done by creating factories with the cards drawn. A factory consists of one output card, and any number of equation cards. By paying the costs in the equation cards, in order, you produce whatever the output card indicates.&#10;&#10;This alone would be a little like solitaire, so enter the challenge you can make once per turn. Challenge anyone for up to three resources, and then each bid a secret amount more. Whoever has more wins everything, unless they overbid by more than three in which case the lower bid wins!

3874;Ultimate Mastermind;"Ultimate Mastermind has an extra code peg which brings it to another dimension. The code-maker selects arranges any 5 pegs in the compartment right in front of him or her, which is hidden from the code breaker. The code-breaker then has to make guesses as to what the code is by filling in rows of 5 pegs using the feedback from the code-maker (correct color/correct position, correct color/incorrect position, or nothing). There are twelve chances to break the code. If the code-breaker cracks the code in 6 tries, that is how many points are given to the code-maker. Players alternate as code-maker and code-breaker for as many rounds as they would like to play. The player with the lowest point total after the predetermined number of rounds are played, is the winner.&#10;&#10;This is a more advanced version of the original Mastermind game. This version includes 5 holes (versus 4 in the original) and two extra chances to break the code.&#10;&#10;";1972;5.958;2.2881;2;2;10;8;Abstract Strategy, Children's Game, Deduction, Puzzle

3883;4th Reich: Puremen vs. the Mutants for Control of the World;"&quot;4th Reich: Puremen vs. the Mutants for Control of the World&quot; is a somewhat obscure wargame by Task Force Games based on (albeit without attribution) the SF-novel &quot;The Iron Dream&quot; by the Jewish author Norman Spinrad. This very controversial novel describes a parallel world in which Hitler wasn't successful with his &quot;Kampf&quot; in Germany and became a successful SF-pulp-novelist in the US. The main part of the book is the actual text of Hitler's &quot;Iron Dream&quot;, a pulp-tale about &quot;Ubermenschen&quot; conquering a future world filled with mutant &quot;scum.&quot; The idea of Spinrad's novel was to expose fascist tendencies in 50's American literature. The TFG designers transported this &quot;theme&quot; into a board game which plays like a wargame: future Nazis against future mutants. The names of all protagonists have been changed in an apparent attempt to avoid infringement, but the game clearly takes its slightly tongue-in-cheek approach directly from the book.&#10;&#10;";1985;5.08477;2.1111;1;2;120;12;Economic, Novel-based, Science Fiction, Wargame, World War II

When one player has only three pieces left, he is allowed to move any piece from any point on the board to any other point in order to more effectively block the winning opponent and to make a line of three.

Each card is worth from 3 to 7 points.&#10;&#10;When one team is in the middle, they can play for double points on their turn; however, if they lose the card, they're sent back a few squares, and the team that gets the puzzle gets the double points.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all teams are in the middle.

3889;Ali Baba;"User review: The treasure cards are placed face down in their slots as nine stacks of four cards. The lid is placed on top of them. The lid has nine dials. Each dial has one of six symbols showing. To access the treasure cards beneath the lid the players alternate turns to twist the dials to show the combination of symbols which match the genie card that is in play. When the genie card has been matched, the player may take as many treasure cards as desired. If a player finds a snake card among the treasure cards taken then the player forfeits all treasure cards taken that turn. Whenever a player is done taking treasure cards a new genie card is put in play and the game continues.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the final genie card is out of play or the final snake has been found. The player with the highest total in treasure cards is the winner.

3948;Jolly Roger: Treasure Islands;"From the Italian company International Team comes this fairly simple game of piracy on the high seas.&#10;&#10;On a map that can only be considered a fantasy world you sail your galleon around the outer islands picking up treasure chests in the hope of delivering the treasures to his island in the middle of the board.&#10;&#10;Movement is handled by way of a wind disk. Every 3 turns this disk turns and the wind will be coming from a new direction. A ship always moves in a straight line that can be at a diagonal. If it is sailing in the direction of the wind it must move 4 spaces. If in a diagonal with the wind it must move 5 spaces. If perpendicular to the wind movement is 3 spaces. If diagonal against the wind movement is 2 spaces and if against the wind 1 space. The wind rotates in a rigid sequence so you can always plan what your ship will be doing. If a ship runs onto land it is sunk. A ship can stop short of its full movement if it is in a harbor square of which each island has one. On the outer islands this is where a galleon picks up treasures and each may carry up to 3. The board wraps around on itself so if a ship sails off an edge it reappears on the opposite side of the board.&#10;&#10;There are 6 dark areas on the seas that can become storms. The start player rolls 2 die at the beginning of his turn and puts a marker on the corresponding areas. Ships cannot enter these and ships that are in these areas cannot move.&#10;&#10;Each player also has a frigate. Frigates attempt to pass over another ship, regardless of the type, which will sink it. A sunken ship will always reappear at that player&rsquo;s island at the start of his next turn. Frigates may not dock at harbors so they cannot end their movement short when passing over one. Ships sunk have their treasures returned to the bank.&#10;&#10;You play until a player has collected an agreed to amount of treasures. The rules suggest 8 to 20.&#10;&#10;The rules take up 3 small pages of which half the page is rules in another language. There are also 4 illustrations in the rules so you end up with about 1 page of rules. Some things are very vague though. How the Disk of Winds is used is not very clear. Here logic can get you through. The islands in the center are not marked as belonging to anyone so I have always had each player put a treasure on one to claim it. We have also played that the islands belong to no one player and you just need to get you treasures to an island. This makes it a lot easier to dock and drop off treasures.&#10;&#10;";1979;5.16667;0.0;2;6;60;10;Fantasy, Nautical, Pirates

3952;Quad Checkers;"Quad Checkers is an abstract strategy game where 4 players move small discs on an 8x8 board, attempting to &quot;capture&quot; an opponent's pieces. It is very similar to the basic Checkers game.&#10;&#10;On each turn, players may only move in a diagonal direction. If a player's piece cannot move to a square, as an opponent's piece is occupying it, the piece is instead moved to the following diagonal square and the opponent's piece is removed from the board (captured). If the following space has another piece in it, the aforementioned move cannot be made. If, in capturing a piece, you are in a position to capture another piece, you may do so until no further pieces can be captured. This is the only time multiple moves may be taken per turn.&#10;&#10;Quad Checkers differs from the original game in that, adjacent to each edge of the board, is an additional 8x3 grid. This is the starting point of the playing pieces for each of the 4 players. From here, pieces move out into the main grid where the competitive play takes place.&#10;&#10;The game is lost for a player if he/she cannot move or if all of his/her pieces are eliminated from the board.&#10;&#10;";1987;0.0;0.0;4;4;10;7;Abstract Strategy, Children's Game

3954;Baseball Strategy;"Welcome to the best FTF fantasy baseball board game ever created. This baseball game is for people who like meat and potatoes with a side of greens. It is the whole enchilada. When playing it you will use your intuition or feel to pick up patterns leading to decisions to outwit your opponent. If you can deal with, &quot;Take that!&quot;, you will like this game. Baseball Strategy is not meant for the shy, but the hearty. Great baseball action. Thrilling too! Never a dull moment and you will actually feel like a batter or a pitcher, manager or a base coach, etc. when you play this game.  Then you can live out your fantasies of being a big-league ball player! At least that's the idea is promoting here and what's wrong with that? Let's face it. Even if you just played wiffle ball in your backyard, haven't you fantasied hitting one into the upper deck at Tiger Stadium, especially having seen a slugger do that many times in your life? It would be nice to hear the cheers as you formally rounded the bases with alacrity to score. Baseball Strategy seems to capture the psychological battle between pitcher and batter quite well. Experience the excitement of getting a bases loaded, bases clearing double when you anticipated the pitch correctly, but you will also experience the agony when you don't! This game is unlike any other baseball game this author has ever played. There are rules for series play in order to give proper rest to pitchers where the entire pitching staff is used and not just the &quot;Aces&quot;.  Series play is highly recommended to have a full &quot;baseball fantasy&quot; playing experience. The game now even has variant injury possibilities, video replay challenges, robs of hit opportunities, MLB Defensive &quot;Leather Larceny&quot; Highlight Plays, setting the infield at DP depth and more.&#10;This fantasy is a cat and mouse game (and vice versa) hiding in plain sight where the two gamers enter a complex matrix of double blind decisions that lead to the inevitable think and counter-think, out witting duel.  Gamers begin by first selecting their lineups from imaginary players or actual players by converting their stats to the game's parameters. (This is easily done from mlb.com on the net or baseball-reference.com.).  If you don&rsquo;t like agony, this game isn&rsquo;t for you!&#10;Enter The Matrix: The Defensive team is the manager and catcher, selecting pitch types (Fast Ball, Off Speed, Pitch out, etc.) to send batters fuming back to the dugout, sometimes with specific outs in a certain situation. Batters attempt to get a hit, get on base or at the least make an out that moves runners into scoring position/ or of course, scoring. (that's the idea, right?) Each tries to anticipate the other's tendencies throughout the game in order to &quot;exploit&quot; them.&#10;After a pitch card is played by the pitcher, the batter must then select a type of offense/ball in play strategy (Steal, Bunt, Hit and Run, Long Ball, etc.)The results of the two choices are found by cross indexing them on a result matrix table. Players can decide on the size of ballpark before the game.&#10;&#10;";1960;5.85593;1.9048;2;2;90;12;Dice, Math, Memory, Sports
3955;BANG!;"&quot;The Outlaws hunt the Sheriff. The Sheriff hunts the Outlaws. The Renegade plots secretly, ready to take one side or the other. Bullets fly. Who among the gunmen is a Deputy, ready to sacrifice himself for the Sheriff? And who is a merciless Outlaw, willing to kill him? If you want to find out, just draw (your cards)!&quot; (From back of box)&#10;&#10;The card game BANG! recreates an old-fashioned spaghetti western shoot-out, with each player randomly receiving a Character card to determine special abilities, and a secret Role card to determine their goal.&#10;&#10;Four different Roles are available, each with a unique victory condition:&#10;&#10;     Sheriff - Kill all Outlaws and the Renegade&#10;     Deputy - Protect the Sheriff and kill any Outlaws&#10;     Outlaw - Kill the Sheriff&#10;     Renegade - Be the last person standing&#10;&#10;&#10;A player's Role is kept secret, except for the Sheriff. Character cards are placed face up on table, and also track strength (hand limit) in addition to special ability.&#10;&#10;There are 22 different types of cards in the draw deck. Most common are the BANG! cards, which let you shoot at another player, assuming the target is within &quot;range&quot; of your current gun.  The target player can play a &quot;MISSED!&quot; card to dodge the shot.  Other cards can provide temporary boosts while in play (for example, different guns to improve your firing range) and special one-time effects to help you or hinder your opponents (such as Beer to restore health, or Barrels to hide behind during a shootout). A horse is useful for keeping your distance from unruly neighbors, while the Winchester can hit a target at range 5. The Gatling is a deadly exception where range doesn't matter: it can only be used once, but targets all other players at the table!&#10;&#10;Information on the cards is displayed using language-independent symbols, and 7 summary/reference cards are included.&#10;&#10;";2002;6.48927;1.6327;4;7;40;8;American West, Bluffing, Card Game, Deduction, Fighting

3957;Bioscopy;"The object of Bioscopy is to be the first player or team to score 20 points in each of the 4 categories of trivia (Who, What, When, and Where).&#10;&#10;Each player or team puts their playing marker at the center of the board, and their 4 scoring markers on the 0 at the start of each of the 4 scoring scrolls. Players take turns rolling a six-sided die to determine how far you may move on the board, moving in any direction they choose (but they may not visit the same space twice in a turn). The spaces on the board are color coded to each of the 4 categories of questions, and are marked with a number (10, 7, 4, and 1) that corresponds to the difficulty of the clue. Each card has 4 clues on it, descending in value (10, 7, 4, and 1). Players may hear the clues in descending value until they reach the minimum value indicated on their space on the board -- if they can successfully answer at a higher point clue value, they will receive the higher points.&#10;&#10;An alternate form of scoring is based on stealing points from the opponents by landing on a space on the board without a number. When this happens, the player competes head-to-head with the person that has scored the most points on that category's scoring scroll.&#10;&#10;";2000;5.7;1.0;3;4;60;0;Trivia

3959;Royal Steeple Chase;"Royal Steeple Chase is a very astonishing game, published in 1939 by Miro Company in France.&#10;4 horses compete on a track of 21 spaces, with hedges and rivers. The players receive cards which indicate two actions. They use these to bid on the horse of their choice.  They can then buy better cards at auction. The money from the bids is shared equally between all the players, and then the race takes place. Each player in turn plays a card and carries out its two actions in the preferred order. The horses which win and place second award points to their owners. If no horse finishes, the players who did not have a horse gain points.&#10;The game contains several variants, some of which were inspired by Bridge and were created by French officers who were prisoners of war in Germany in 1941.&#10;&#10;Royal Steeple Chase est un jeu tr&egrave;s etonnant, paru en 1939 chez Miro Company en France.&#10;4 chevaux s'affrontent sur une piste de 21 cases, avec des haies et des rivi&egrave;res.

After placement of the nuggets, the player may purchase up to two shares of stock of the mines represented by the nuggets on the gameboard.

In addition to the standard numbers and suits the cards also contain a letter of the alphabet.&#10;&#10;The players are attempting to create &quot;runs&quot;, &quot;groups&quot; and &quot;words&quot;. A Run is four or more cards in the same suit in sequence. A Group is three or more of a kind. A Word is formed using the letters on the cards and can be any non-proper word found in a standard dictionary. A game consists of seven rounds, and in each round a player must form a specific number of Runs, Groups and Words.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt a number of cards, the exact number of which varies depending on the round in play. Each turn the player draws the top card from the deck or from the discard pile then plays as many cards as possible (either by forming new Runs, Groups or Words or by adding them onto cards which have already been played, either by themselves or by other players). Finally, they discard one of their remaining cards. The round ends when one player manages to empty their hand.&#10;&#10;Players gain points by forming the number of Groups, Runs and Words specified for the round and for the cards in the melds they created. They lose points for cards left in their hand when the round ends.

3966;The Succession Wars;"The Succession Wars is a grand strategic game set in the BattleTech universe. The game  system is not overly complex, but does feature money (taxing and expenditures), technology levels, and leaders (characters from the BattleTech continuity, who have multiple uses).&#10;&#10;Note that despite what the box copy below implies, all five Houses are always in play. Playing with fewer than five players requires at least some players to play multiple Houses.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, there are in fact only two scenarios provided in the box, one for the Third (or possibly Fourth) Succession War, starting in 3025, and one for the First, starting in 2786.&#10;&#10;From the back of the box:&#10;&#10;For over 200 years, the five Successor States of the near-legendary Star League have warred among themselves for dominion over the whole Inner Sphere. There have been three Succession Wars to date, but no victor. The cost of war is high. The leaders of the Successor States must weigh each maneuver to see whether the gain in territory is worth the loss of 'Mechs. Only the most ruthless and brilliant leader will emerge as the next Star Lord.&#10;&#10;The Succession Wars is a 2- to 5-player game, where each player assumes the role of a House leader. All the most famous and infamous regiments of the BattleTech universe are at your command - the elite Kurita Sword of Light, the Davion Guards, and the mercenary unit Wolf's Dragoons. The game allows players to fight any Succession War, including the fourth, toward which the Inner Sphere is now building.

The only human characters in the game are the Wizards themselves and the greatest warriors; ordinary mortals stay out of the way when dragons battle with demons and giants. The Wizards attempt to rally neutral beings to their cause, and to hamper their opponent's efforts by moving the very terrain itself.

3972;Catan: Portable Edition;"Settlers of Catan Travel Edition is, as the name says, a Travel Edition of The Settlers of Catan. &#10;The rules of the game are the same, but there are some changes between the two editions: &#10;&#10;    No Expansions: In the Travel Edition it is not possible to add any expansions to the regular game, so it is a 3 or 4 players game only. &#10;    Pre-determined Desert location: The hex containing the Desert is always in the middle of the board. &#10;    Pre-determined numbers: The numbers for production are in fixed locations on the board. That is a natural follow up to the previous item. &#10;    Pre-determined port location: Although the type of port at a given location may vary, the port sites themselves are in fixed locations.

3974;Karl May-Spiel;"Karl May Spiel is a game rather intended for the children. The principle is classic. The players are in confrontation in a running where it is necessary to be the first one in the arrival, having found two identical objects and having crossed different obstacles. The originality of the game lives in the die. In fact, there is no die, because the players determine their advance by a shot to the elastic representing archery. It is thus the fitness and not the fate that leads the game, but for some players, it is about the same thing!&#10;&#10;";1988;5.0;1.5;2;5;30;8;Action / Dexterity, American West, Racing

3977;Strong Stuff!;"Bruno the Bear is ravenously hungry, so hungry that he's prone to grabbing honey jars recklessly and taking off for the woods. But will you be able to help him carry his ever-growing pile of honey jars without knocking them over?&#10;&#10;Strong Stuff! &ndash; previously published by Goldsieber with slightly different rules as B&auml;renstark &ndash; is a dexterity game in which players move Bruno, represented by a wooden bear, across a series of meadow tokens. Each turn, the active player rolls the die then either moves Bruno a number of spaces equal to the number of dots on the die or leaves him in place; when moving Bruno, a player cannot touch the tray he holds or any honey jars already balanced on his head. In either case, the player ends his turn by stacking a new honey jar on the highest jar on Bruno's tray.&#10;&#10;The honey jars come in six sizes, making stacking tricky; should any jar fall while a player moves Bruno, that player loses one of two honey drops he was given at the start of the game. Once a player loses both honey drops, the game ends and whoever has the most honey drops in hand wins.&#10;&#10;The HABA edition of Strong Stuff! includes a special die for experienced players in which you're challenged to spin Bruno in place or move him only with your right or left hand. (Note: The HABA edition is for 2-6 players, while Goldsieber's B&auml;renstark was labeled for 2-4 players.)&#10;&#10;";2002;6.41475;1.0;2;6;20;5;Action / Dexterity, Children's Game, Party Game

The players have the same set of cards at the beginning of the play. Each at his turn plays a card back to front on the table in a virtual tray of 6x6. When all the cards are put, you turn the whole and each books its points.

In turn, each player draws and places a card on one of the grids. Most cards can only be placed on a designated cell. For example, 'E'/'5' (Sabotage/Leopard) can only be played into a center cell. A few cards (10-K in Leopard) have special abilities (e.g., wild, cover opponent).&#10;&#10;Each row, column, and/or diagonal of three like-colored/-suited cards scores points.

3984;Tahiti;"A quirky auction game played on a delightfully eye-catching roll-up board with large colored marbles and stylized wooden sailboats.&#10;&#10;The colored marbles are designated &quot;pearls,&quot; and you buy spots for them on the board in two steps, taken in either order:  First (or second), buy a pearl of a particular color.  Second (or first), buy the right to place it in a row or column labeled with a particular letter.  There's an auction on each player's turn where one choice in both these possibilities goes on sale at the same time.  So, perhaps the auction is for B, or a blue pearl.  If you win the auction and you've already got a pearl, you immediately have to choose a spot for it somewhere in row or column B; if you've already got your letter bought, you get the blue pearl and immediately choose a spot for it; if you've got neither, you can take either one and await getting the other in a later auction.&#10;&#10;Ultimately your scores are determined by how many pearls of the same color are clustered together and the number of empty spaces surrounding the cluster, and whether you have more pearls than anyone else in the cluster.&#10;&#10;Tahiti is an excellent choice if you enjoy auctions, area majorities, and that &quot;Acquire&quot; kind of feeling you get from watching squares fill in and grow into scoring groups.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.47188;2.1667;2;4;45;10;
3985;Crisis: Korea 1995;"Forty years of tense, uneasy peace are suddenly shattered as the Korean Peninsula erupts in renewed warfare. Two peoples -- historically, ethnically, and culturally homogeneous, but polarized by politics and economics -- hurl men, weapons, and materials into the fray in an attempt to settle their division once and for all.&#10;&#10;From Pyongyang in North Korea to Pusan in South Korea, the battle rages. While the front line surges east to west across the peninsula, both sides commit airborne and seaborne Special Forces and Marines as well as their Air Forces to deep penetrations into enemy territory. With skilled infiltration capabilities, and the strategic mobility of armor, airmobile, paratroop, and marine forces, there is no safe haven throughout the length or breadth of Korea.&#10;&#10;While the North and South battle for a quick, decisive victory, the world awaits the response of the two military superpowers in the region, the United States of America and the People's Republic of China. Will the United States reinforce the South, and if so, how, when, and in what strength? Will the Communist Chinese again intervene into the Korean conflict as they did in 1950? As the situation evolves, choices are made, forces are committed, and the security of Japan and the future of the two Koreas hangs in the balance.&#10;&#10;Crisis: Korea 1995 allows players to fight a near-future war on the peninsula. Players have access to virtually all available military assets of North and South Korea, as well as large forces from the USA and the PRC. The integrated, easy-to-learn air-land combat system allows for unit efficiency, armor effects, tunnels, light infantry, attack helicopter, Close Air Support, Cruise Missiles, and particularly tough terrain of Korea.&#10;&#10;";1992;6.91075;4.3333;2;4;360;12;Modern Warfare, Political, Wargame
3986;Battle for Germany;"Battle for Germany game is small, it only takes about three to four hours to play for players of normal skill and luck. The game starts in December of 1944 with the Ardennes Offensive (a variant allows the German player to skip this and save his strength). As a two-player game, it is interesting in that each player plays both an Allied army (Western Allies or Soviet Union) AND a German army (Western Front or Eastern Front). This forces each player to play offense and defense. The player playing the Western Allies and Eastern Germans has a very challenging task. The Western Germans have good defensive terrain (the Rhine river and Westwall defenses), while the Eastern Germans have weak units, a long front, very poor defensive terrain and they face a large Soviet and Yugoslav army. The only real advantage enjoyed by the East German player is the lack of victory points to be gained in the East, and the slow Soviet replacement rate. The Western Alllied units are very fast moving, but they don't usually get a chance to exploit this until the very end of the game (at best).&#10;&#10;The map is the same size as most SPI Quadrigames or folio games and has similar graphics. Cities are rated as 1 or 2 victory points, with Berlin worth 10. A line down the middle of Germany cannot be crossed (in the 2-player game), which makes Berlin the only city which can be captured by the Western Allies or the Soviets (ahistorical, but essential to the game's concept). Units are corps for the Germans and Western Allies and corps, armies, or fronts for the Soviet player. Each unit is rated for attack, defense and movement. Combat is decided by an odds-based combat results table and a die roll. Combat results include various combinations of retreat and elimination (there are no step losses, disruption or anything like this). Eliminated units can be replaced, but very slowly and (for some players) with the weakest available unit coming back first.&#10;&#10;The game includes variants for 3- and 4-player versions where the Germans are played by 1 or 2 players, and a &quot;red star/ white star&quot; scenario where the Western Allies and Soviets fight it out with some help from the remnants of the German army.&#10;&#10;Originally published in S&amp;T 50 - May/Jun 1975&#10;&#10;";1975;7.19587;2.1154;2;4;180;12;Wargame, World War II

Once all of the Answer cards are down, the player who was first to answer turns over their Answer card.  If the answer is correct, they receive 2 tokens from the middle pile.  The Reader will then ask everyone to turn their Answer cards over.  All other players with the correct answer will receive 1 token.  All players with the wrong answer (including the player who puts their Answer card down first) will have to put 1 token back in the middle pile.&#10;The Reader&rsquo;s turn is complete when all 3 questions have been read.  The Question card is then returned, face down, to the bottom of the Question card pile.&#10;&#10;During the game you will randomly draw Rush Hour cards.  The Reader who picks up a Rush Hour card may nominate any player to answer the Rush Hour questions.  Once the nomination has been made, the egg timer is turned over and the Reader begins to read the questions.  The aim is to have all 5 questions asked and answered within the time limit so that both Reader and the answering player have a chance to win as many extra tokens as possible.&#10;&#10;There are two ways to win Fact or Crap.&#10;- The game ends when all tokens from the middle pile are gone.  Players then count up their tokens.

4006;P.O.W. Rescue;"This is a pretty esoteric game. The object of the game is to rescue POW's from Viet Nam's infamous Hanoi Hilton. The first player to rescue and escape with a POW from the camp cell and reach the end of the rescue/escape route wins the game. The designer believed that POW's were still being held in North Viet Nam and apparently created this game to keep people aware of that fact. He comments &quot; POW Rescue is an action game of rescue dedicated to those still held as POW with the hope that Americans will never forget those we left behind&quot;.

4012;Army Group Center: June 22-28, 1941;"Army Group Center: The Opening Blitz on Minsk, June 22-28, 1941 is an operational level game of the German Blitzkrieg Campaign of June 22, 1941 against the Soviet Union.&#10;&#10;Specifically, the game covers the attempt by German Army Group Center to encircle the Soviet Forces deployed on the front ar Belorussia, centered on the city of Minsk. The surprise attack was executed as planning by two Panzer groups, commanded by Colonel Generals Hoth and Guderian. The Soviet commander of the Western Front forces, General Pavlov, was taken completely by surprise, and, by order of the Soviet Supreme Command, dispatched his mobile forces directly into the German pincers. Most of the Soviet forces, including the mobile reserves, were thrown into disarray by the German first strike and were eliminated piecemeal.&#10;&#10;On June 28 the Germans closed their first major pocket of the war in the east. It extended from Belostok (Bialystok) to Minsk. 287,000 Soviet troops surrendered in this pocket, and in addition 2585 tanks and 1449 guns were captured. By July 3 the German forces had swept Belorussia of Soviet resistance with the single exception of the garrison at the fortress at Brest. From there they drove on to their next objectives of Smolensk and the Dnieper River, and from there towards Moscow.&#10;&#10;Army Group Center is a two player game in which one player controls the German forces, the other the Soviet.&#10;&#10;The game is presented in three separate scenarios, the first historical, the second and third hypothetical. The historical scenario is largely a one-sided affair and should be played by those wishing to glean the historical lessons of the German blitzkrieg campaign. For those wishing more balanced play, the second and third scenarios are recommended in which a hypothetical situation is postulated where the Soviets were aware of the German invasion plans and had prepared accordingly.&#10;&#10;Army Group Center was published by 3W in 1993.

Early November Soviets attacks blew holes in the thin German defenses, resulting in the liberation of Kiev and the pursuit to Korosten and Zhitomir.  A massive German riposte led by the XLVIII Panzerkorps stuck the Soviet flank and rolled back some of the initial Soviet Gains.

4018;Pentagon Games;"A book containing three games:&#10;&#10;&#10;Pentagon&#10;&#10;Pentagon is not a simulation in the formal sense of the word. The events in the game are intended to be illustrative and the decisions fictitious, woven from the progress of play. But by giving the players incentives both to compete and to cooperate, the game does simulate bureaucratic politics. And the content of bureaucratic politics is similar in tone and substance to real debates over military budgets. Pentagon shows how political factors influence the shape of budgets before the bureaucracy even gets down to decisions on weapons procurement and their merits.&#10;&#10;&#10;The R&amp;D Game: Congressional Chutes and Ladders&#10;&#10;The R&amp;D Game is designed as a solitaire game. It is based on a decision-tree mechanism that leads the player through a set of alternative developments. This type of approach is sometimes called a &quot;scripted role&quot; model because the main emphasis is on broad decision choices rather than narrow selection of tactics. Given the broad choice, the decision tree itself generates much of the action, unlike a two-player or multi-player game in which action flows from the decisions of each of the players.&#10;&#10;&#10;The Last Days of Saigon&#10;&#10;An introductory level wargame.

4026;Udder Madness;"A lighthearted cow-tipping game in which aliens are trying to tip cows for bragging rights.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;In the first part of the game, players place their cows. &#10;On an 8x8 grid (3 players) or 9x9 grid (2 or 4 players), players take turns placing 12 cow chits of their color, 1 at a time and 1 per cell, inside the fence, which is a 1-cell perimeter. When placing cows, players try to achieve Cow Lock, which is two identically-colored orthogonally adjacent cows. Four cows in a square is called a Bovine Doom Block. Next, each player places their alien chit on the center square of their edge of the board (on the grid, but outside the fence). They take turns moving the alien up to 3 spaces, and then they may choose to tip cows. Tipping starts from the alien and stops at a Cow Lock -- the alien cannot tip a cow directly into a cow of the same color. The player then collects all tipped cows.&#10;&#10;To determine individual scores, each player tallies their cows, subtracting the number of cows of their color from the remaining cows. High score wins.&#10;&#10;In the 2-player game, each player uses a single alien marker as normal, but chooses and places cows of 2 colors. Cow Lock and Bovine Doom Block can still only be achieved with cows of the same color.&#10;&#10;&#10;From the packaging:&#10;In Udder Madness you are an alien engaged in a contest with your alien pals to see who can tip the most cows of your opponents while tipping as few of your own as possible.&#10;&#10;Why an alien, you ask? Well there are a couple of reasons.&#10;&#10;One reason is that by now, any alien visitors we may have must surely have grown bored with abducting people and examining their nether-regions. So with nether-regions out, and crop circles quickly becoming pass, they're going to need some new mystifying activity... Why not this?&#10;&#10;The second reason is that we at Placebo Press could not possibly believe that an actual human being, no matter how depraved or intoxicated, would participate in such an activity outside of the confines of a harmless board game? Hence it must be aliens. I don't think that our logic is flawed here.&#10;&#10;";2000;3.51923;0.0;2;4;45;7;Abstract Strategy, Animals, Humor

The piece that you land on is destroyed. The capturing piece gains +1 power.&#10;&#10;Power Transfer&#10;&#10;As pieces move over one another, they exchange power. You give (1) power from your moving piece to each of your own pieces that you jump. Your piece takes (1) power from each enemy piece it passes over.&#10;&#10;Underpowered and Overpowered Pieces: During movement, if a piece falls below (1) power, it is has become underpowered and is removed from the board. Likewise, if a piece gains more than (6) power, it has become overpowered and is removed from the board.&#10;&#10;Winning&#10;&#10;There are two possible ways to win Metis.&#10;&#10;1. Occupy seats in your opponents Temple of Metis. There are two areas in each players temple: The inner chamber (darker) and the outer chamber (lighter). Occupying a seat in the inner chamber is worth 2 occupation points. occupying a seat in the outer chamber is worth 1 occupation point. You must hold 8 occupation points to win the game.&#10;&#10;2. Destroy opponent&rsquo;s pieces until she has three or less (making the above goal impossible for your opponent).&#10;&#10;";2001;7.9;0.0;2;2;30;8;Abstract Strategy

Stronger animals can eat weaker ones, but the rat can defeat the elephant by crawling into its ear. Interest is added to the board by a river (navigable only by the rat, but the lion and tiger can leap across it) and pitfalls (which make all animals vulnerable to attack by weaker ones). Sets can be bought cheaply in many Chinese shops; some have rules in English. This is not a deep intellectual exercise, but a strategic game that can be enjoyed even by young children.&#10;&#10;";0;5.93124;1.75;2;2;20;6;Abstract Strategy, Animals, Children's Game

4033;Rosetta;"Rosetta is a tile laying game where players are trying to match the designs on the tiles to form a complete picture.&#10;The two main game types are co-op in that players are all working together to complete the design. It can be thought of as a puzzle, with square pieces, that has multiple solutions.&#10;&#10;On one side of the tiles, the &quot;Rosetta&quot;, 1-3 players work together to make a 6x6 square picture. When complete, the picture shows different coloured flowers, each made up of two corresponding square pieces. You may choose to use the 4 joker tiles as wild cards.&#10;&#10;On the other side, &quot;Puncola&quot;, you are creating a 6x6 square picture by matching the edges of the tiles with a similar pattern on an adjacent tile. At the corners of certain tiles is a 1/4 circle that is paired with 3 other tiles to form a complete circle.&#10;&#10;&quot;Domino-Puncola&quot; is an alternate version of the game that adds competition. Each player picks 5 tiles at random and, in turn, tries to match an edge of the &quot;Puncola&quot; side to a tile on the table. If that person cannot place his/her tile, he/she draws a new one. The first person to place all of his/her tiles is the winner.&#10;&#10;";1974;4.4;1.0;1;4;20;0;Puzzle

If more than one player earns 500 points when the hand's points are totaled, the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Each round, players are dealt 5 cards. They may discard and replace up to 3 three of them, and then each one makes a sensible headline with the cards in their hand.

4036;Anzio Beachhead;"Anzio Beachhead is an operational level simulation game of the allied invasion of the Italian mainland near Rome during WWII. The invasion began January 22, 1944, under the code name Operation Shingle. It had the Alban Hills and the isolation of the German army as its objective. Failing in this, Allied troops would have to hold until relieved. Here Hitler recognized Germany's great chance to destroy an Allied invasion. Had his troops succeeded in destroying the beachhead, the war in Europe could well have been lengthened.&#10;&#10;Anzio Beachhead is a two-player game in which one player controls the German forces while his opponent controls the Allied forces.&#10;&#10;This first appeared in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #20 in December 1969, along with Bastogne. SPI later released it in white box and black formats during the 1970s.

The original American commander was not bold, and lost. So the idea with AB was to explore the what if's. At that time, I had been working on designing games for about eight years (since I first discovered the AH games.) Before that, I was always interested in the details of history, and how they were connected. AH wargames were the first time I saw someone else thinking the same way, and doing it in a novel way.

4061;Tiles;"Game equipment consists of 72 letter tiles (color-coded to indicate vowel, common consonant, or less-common consonant) and two frames. Each frame holds 19 letter tiles in an array of four interlocking words, of 4, 5, 6 and 7 letters; the frames can be rotated and flipped to form 16 different patterns.  A player draws 19 to 25 tiles (depending on desired level of difficulty), balancing the colors to get a good mix of letters, and tries to form words in the frame.  Can be played solitaire or competitively.&#10;&#10;";1990;5.125;0.0;1;4;10;0;Word Game

4064;Scrabble Up;"Bears little resemblance to the classic word game it's named for.  Each player starts with six letter tiles; the first to accumulate 19 or more is the winner.  Each player tries to form the longest possible word from the OTHER player's tiles, starting with the last tile drawn.  The first to find a word starts a marble rolling down a zigzag groove, and the other player must give a word before the marble reaches the bottom.  Then each player takes the tiles of the word they formed from the other player, each draws a new starting tile, and they take the next turn.  There is also a variant which uses the point values on the tiles (same as in Scrabble) for scoring.&#10;&#10;";1996;4.63962;1.5;2;2;30;8;Word Game

Each turn the player can place a tile in a clear position, or over the stacked tiles in an filled position provided that the dots on the tile do not overlap those on the tiles already played. Once all 9 possible dots are placed in each position the stacked tiles are removed for reuse and the position is cleared for new tile placements.

4086;Napoleon at Bay: The Campaign in France, 1814;"&quot;Napoleon at Bay&quot; is a division level, two-player simulation of the Campaign of 1814 which was one of Napoleon's finest. He conducted this campaign with subtlety and lightning speed against heavy odds, attacking isolated enemy forces on advantageous terms. This game shows Napoleon's skill in a classic use of interior lines, shifting to engage the combined armies of Russia, Prussia and Austria.&#10;&#10;GAME SYSTEM: CAMPAIGNS System - Series 1X = 3,200m/hex, 1,000 men/SP, 2 days/turn.&#10;1983 Edition: 260 counters (includes 18 blanks)&#10;&#10;";1978;7.0417;3.4634;2;2;180;12;Napoleonic, Wargame
4087;1812: The Campaign of Napoleon in Russia;"The &quot;1812 Grand Tactical game&quot; is a simulation of the French invasion of Russia. The defeat of Napoleon in this campaign eventually led to the collapse of the French Empire, and the demise of that truly great military leader. The Grand Tactical game simulates the mechanics of strategic maneuver and tactical decision in this campaign. The game is divided into three Scenarios: Scenario 1 starts in June with the opposing forces deployed and ready to start the campaign. Scenario 2 starts in August, with Napoleon deep inside Russia and preparing his final drive to Moscow. In October, Napoleon in Moscow is about to begin the epic winter retreat as Russian armies converge from all directions.&#10;&#10;The &quot;1812 Area Version&quot; is a simulation of Napoleon's invasion of Russia between June and December 1812. This version is based upon systems different from the usual &quot;hexagonal&quot; pattern. The map is divided into geographical Areas and Sub-areas; while the Areas have equal supply capacity, the Subareas encompass roughly the same distance for movement and combat purposes. A totally new system of combat simulates the major factors important in Napoleonic battles without excessive quantification and simplification. In addition, because supply was so crucial to movement and combat decisions in this campaign, unique supply rules complement the innovative movement and combat systems.&#10;&#10;(above extract from rules)&#10;&#10;Two versions are included, using separate maps covering most of Russia. The strategic game is area driven, while the tactical version covers the game scope but using hex mechanics.&#10;&#10;There is an earlier version of the box that is NOT plastic, it is a completely cardboard box. Many of the early SPI games came in these cardboard boxes until someone bright decided that the plastic ones would be cheaper and more easily manipulated for advertising.&#10;&#10;400 Counters&#10;&#10;";1972;6.98861;2.3571;0;0;0;12;Napoleonic, Wargame
4090;2nd Fleet: Modern Naval Combat in the North Atlantic;"2nd Fleet is a refinement of Victory Games (I) popular Sixth Fleet: Modern Naval Combat in the Mediterranean game system, and examines the strengths and weaknesses of the Soviet Red Banner Northern Fleet and the US Second Fleet and its NATO allies in future conflict for control of the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. Players are placed in command of the opposing superpower fleets. The mighty aircraft carriers and escorting capital ships must be protected from the devastating firepower of modern missiles, torpedoes, and bomb attacks. Attack submarines threaten the enemy task forces and replenishment convoys while searching out their submerged rivals. Limited air assets must be carefully assigned to combat air patrols, long-range strategic missions and attack strikes. 2nd Fleet, with its multitude of options and strategies, is one of today's most realistic recreations of modern naval warfare on the high seas.&#10;&#10;Each 8 hour game turn is broken into 3 distinct phases (sub, surface, and air) and each player takes turns choosing which phase they wish to conduct. Ex. if the US player chooses &quot;Air&quot;, they conduct all bombing, shipping strikes, anti-sub, and interception actions for all their aircraft.&#10;Players also use their units to attempt to &quot;detect&quot; enemy forces so that an attack can be made. Ships and aircraft are always detected once a unit moves close enough to them, but players have to roll to try to detect subs.&#10;Optional rules include nuclear weapons and logistics.&#10;About 10 scenarios are included which range from about 60 minutes (for Introductory Scenarios) to 3 to 6 hours (for Intermediate Scenarios) to 20 or more hours (for the Advanced Scenario).&#10;&#10;Part of Victory Games Fleet Series.&#10;&#10;";1986;7.34895;3.4255;1;2;240;12;Modern Warfare, Nautical, Wargame

Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.&#10;&#10;There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.&#10;&#10;Note: The 2012 edition of Star Munchkin from Pegasus Spiele includes the first expansion, Star Munchkin 2: The Clown Wars.

4099;Keythedral;"A Keythedral is being built in the fields near Keytown, in the middle of the Keydom. The inhabitants of Keyland will gather the resources with which to build the Keythedral from the surrounding fields.&#10;&#10;The Keythedral will be built in five stages, and each stage will require different building materials. In the early stages, simple materials will be needed, and as the building nears completion, more specialized materials will be needed. Throughout the development period, the builders will require food and water, and, if they are lucky, the builders will also receive some wine.&#10;&#10;In the game, each player starts with five cottages. Each cottage houses a worker. Each turn, every worker will try to move into one of the fields adjacent to their cottage in order to gather resources from the land. These resources are required for building the Keythedral.&#10;&#10;Problems, however, are at hand. Firstly, no one is ever quite sure what the building requirements for the next stage of the Keythedral will be until the previous stage is completed. Secondly, once more workers arrive, the fields will become crowded, and some of the workers will be idle. Players may choose to fence off some of the fields in order to keep out their opponents' workers. However, the workers are quite partial to the odd tipple, and for a couple of barrels of wine, they can be persuaded to remove any one of the fences that a player has taken offense to!&#10;&#10;Good luck in your endeavors to keep your workers productive and to get the right building materials at the right time.&#10;&#10;Keythedral is Richard Breese's fourth game in the key series.&#10;&#10;";2002;7.04166;2.8477;2;5;90;8;City Building, Medieval

4104;Sssnake;"Players each try to be the first to build a complete snake, connecting the head and tail of the snake printed on their large start tiles.  On a player's turn he rolls a special die and plays one or more small tiles showing snake body parts to either his own snake or to his left-hand neighbor's snake.

4105;The Wheel of Time Collectible Card Game;"The Wheel of Time CCG is based on the novels of the same name, penned by Robert Jordan, and later, Brandon Sanderson. One player takes the side of the light and the Dragon Reborn, while another takes the side of the shadow and the Forsaken, in a struggle for control of the Pattern, the ultimate fabric and destiny of the universe.&#10;&#10;Each player requires his or her own Hero or Villain deck to play. Each deck features a major character from the Wheel of Time book series. The light side player chooses a hero to play with while the shadow player uses a villain deck. Characters in the side of light include series protagonists Rand al'Thor, Matrim Cauthon, Perrin Aybara, and the other characters of good found within the books. Characters for the shadow include dark friends, as well as Rahvin and the other chosen.&#10;&#10;The players attempt to sway the Pattern to their side and amass the might needed to defeat his or her opponent in the final Pattern challenge and win the game. Along the way players will engage in politics, marshaling of armies, magic, and intrigue in an effort to bring characters, troops, and entire kingdoms onto their side.&#10;&#10;The core of the Wheel of Time CCG involves rolling dice. Characters and troops, each have different stats corresponding to their skill in politics, intrigue, combat and the one power. These stats translate into dice rolls, used to win challenges and to generate resources.&#10;&#10;Every turn, players commit their characters and troops into challenges. Challenges are done via playing challenge cards or initiating the pattern challenge, which is the ultimate objective for both the light and shadow. Unassigned characters and troops can be used to generate resources which in turn, can summon more allies or to attach buffs called advantages.&#10;&#10;Players then contest challenges by comparing dice rolls of their committed characters and troops. The attacking player attempts to roll swords in the in-game custom dice, while the defending player attempts to roll shields. Winning challenge cards grant advantages based on card text, while winning the Pattern challenge may place Pattern tokens toward the side of the victorious player.&#10;&#10;End game triggers upon both players having a total of twenty Pattern tokens, together with any neutral tokens generated during play. The game then proceeds to the final challenge, where the players fight for dominance, again rolling the dice generated by their characters and troops, but this time, adding their Pattern tokens toward their success rolls.&#10;&#10;";2000;5.41161;2.8571;2;6;60;10;Card Game, Collectible Components, Fantasy, Novel-based

4108;Big Bucks Baseball;"Not a stats based game and not a &quot;replay&quot; game. Teams are fictional and can be built based on fixed points or amount of money the team has. Players are of three average, good, exceptional and cost different amounts of money to &quot;hire&quot;. &#10;Money can either be a fixed amount in pick up games, or using the advanced economy rules, can be obtained from running concessions and selling broadcasting rights.&#10;&#10;The dual-fold, multi-color game board folds for easy storage. Each comes with three teams of ten sculptured ABS figurines, each with individually stenciled numbers. A designated hitter is included on each team. Since the whole family can play BIG BUCKS BASEBALL, one set of figurines is female.&#10;&#10;The game also includes 3 special challenging dice, 32 player upgrade snap rings, 12 ball/strike markers, 10 concession/broadcast replicas, 2 miniature game baseballs, 90 pieces of currency, 32 special event cards, 2 reproducible score sheets, and a complete instruction booklet and quick start guide. All of this is packaged in a compact 10-inch by 10-inch durable game box.&#10;&#10;The game uses a unique system of roulette type spinner based on batter and pitcher's experience (3 levels) to determine the outcome of each pitch. Once a pitch is hit the defensive team can still field the ball using a system of color coded dice. Careful through, failing the fielding roll will increase the effectiveness of the hit (error). Also there are event cards such as injuries and automatic player upgrades (having a good night) which influence the game randomly.  &#10;&#10;&#10;";1995;4.25;0.0;2;2;180;0;Economic, Sports

4112;Hex;"Hex was invented by the Danish mathematician and poet Piet Hein, who introduced the game in 1942 at the Niels Bohr Institute. The same year Hex appeared in the Danish newspaper Politiken under the name Polygon. Hein introduced the game to the readers on December 26, 1942 and during the following four months gave them a problem each day to begin with - eventually two days a week, on Wednesdays and Saturdays. The solution would always appear in the following column. It was independently invented by mathematician John Nash in 1947 at Princeton University. In 1952, Parker Brothers marketed a version. They called their version Hex, and the name stuck. Hex has the simplest rules of almost any game: connect your color edges with a path of tokens of your color. There is also a &quot;swap rule&quot; (also known as a pie rule) which compensates for the inherent advantage of the first player.&#10;&#10;There are a number of resources for Hex on the internet, including several real-time servers. If you want to play face-to-face, used Hex sets are occasionally available, and you can also make your own set. A Battlemat with 1&quot; hexes can be cut into a 15x15 rhombus grid. Standard Go stones also work well for this board.  It is also playable as a pencil-and-paper game, like the 3M Paper Game version.&#10;&#10;";1942;6.70119;3.049;2;2;20;8;Abstract Strategy
4113;Tigers in the Mist: Ardennes Offensive;"Tigers in the Mist, Ardennes Offensive, The Battle of the Bulge, December 16 - 22, 1944, this game simulates the early stages of the German offensive in the Ardennes section of Western Europe (Germany, France, Belgium, and Luxembourg) in December of 1944. Historically, the Germans planned to break through the thin American defenses in this area, cross the Meuse River, and seize the port of Antwerp in Belgium. The German high command hoped that success would force a political settlement on the Western Front, thus allowing Germany to direct its full attention to defeating the Russians. In order to win the game, the German player will almost certainly have to get some units across the Meuse River&#10;&#10;The Ardennes, a thickly wooded area on the borders of Germany, Belgium, and Luxembourg, where battle weary U.S. divisions were sent to rest and replace losses, or units freshly arrived from the United States were given their first taste of front line duty. At 5:30am, December 16, 1944, this 85-mile-long sector erupted into what would be the largest, most costly campaign on the Western Front in WWII. The Battle of the Bulge had begun.&#10;&#10;During the first week of the battle, three German armies attacked vigorously and relentlessly in an attempt to reach the Meuse River, the major geographical obstacle between them and the great port of Antwerp on the northern coast of Belgium. Stubborn resistance by outnumbered American forces in the difficult terrain of the Ardennes canceled out much of the initial material advantages and surprise the Germans enjoyed. On December 22, Patton's Third Army began attacking the German southern flank north of Arlon, and on the 23rd, the weather finally cleared, allowing Allied air supremacy to be re-asserted over the battlefield.&#10;&#10;As the German player, can you break through the American player's front lines and get sufficient forces across the Meuse River before the Allies can bring enough reinforcements to the threatened sector to stop the Ardennes Offensive? Play Tigers in the Mist and discover what might have been.&#10;&#10;From the GMT website:&#10;An impulse based movement and combat system which forces both sides to hoard reserves to respond to both opportunity and disaster on the battlefield.&#10;&#10;Four scenarios playable in one-to-five hours, including an introductory scenario, two tournament scenarios of three hour duration, and a campaign scenario which covers the first week of the battle.&#10;&#10;Rules, charts, and examples are organized for ease of use.

4127;Arne;"The concept of Arne is new. Arne is cheeky, creative, and chaotic. And always spiced with the most unexpected turns. As a player, you change the direction of the game, take over someone&rsquo;s turn, protect your own cards, steal someone else&rsquo;s and wreck the strategy of your opponents. Your luck can turn at any moment: Arne literally goes every which way.&#10;&#10;Arne is suitable for all ages. A few practice games, and children from the age of seven start playing seriously. Boys and girls mainly enjoy the high tease factor of the game. But the countless combination possibilities make the game just as much fun for adults. You don&rsquo;t have to know Arne inside out to score well: luck plays an important part. Parents, children, grandparents &hellip; everybody&rsquo;s chances for winning are the same.&#10;&#10;There are no words printed on the Arne cards. So the game is universal: people of various mother tongues can play together perfectly well. Another great advantage is that the game does not take long to play: a round of Arne takes ten minutes, a quarter of an hour at the most. However, you will not know who is winning until the last cards have been played. Those who have saved plenty of points can be sent back to the beginning by just one card. And those who were not doing well can snatch victory at the very last minute.&#10;&#10;How ARNE Works!&#10;&#10;Whoever collects most points wins. Each player first chooses a color and then goes and tries to collect as many points of that color as possible. The other players try to do the same. The point of the game is to sabotage their attempts as much as possible. You do this by making use of the teaser cards. In order to make the game even more fun, there are two sorts of cards:&#10;&#10;White cards which you may only play when it is your turn &#10;Black cards which you may play whenever you want to&#10;&#10;In practice, all players can play cards at the same time.

The fighting that month, north of the besieged city of Mantua, proved to be one of the first great challenges in the young General Bonaparte's career. Two Austrian forces under Marshal Alvinczy and Lt. General Davidovitch threatened to converge on the French from the north and east, join together at Verona, and march southwards to raise the siege. Bonaparte's task was to make use of his interior lines around Verona to unite his scattered and out-numbered troops, and defeat the separate wings of the Austrian &quot;pincers&quot; in detail.&#10;&#10;BATTLE for ITALY is Avalon Hill's new strategy game for two players which recreates the critlcal period of November. 1796.

4148;Mehen;"In the 1920s, anthropologists, explorers and adventurers found a curious spiral-tracked game being played by the Baggara Arabs of the Sudan &mdash;Li'b el Merafib, &ldquo;The Hyena Game&rdquo;.  In all essential details the &quot;Hyena Game&quot; seems to have been identical to the Ancient Egyptian game of Mehen (The Game of the Coiled One).  The board's shape suggests it may be a distant ancestor of the Game of Goose but the mechanics are so different that this is probably a coincidence.&#10;&#10;It was played on a spiraling track, employed stick dice (throwing sticks) of precisely the kind known from Archaic Egyptian contexts, and had two types of pieces, one representing a predatory animal.  The only difference would seem to be that the ancient Egyptians allotted six counters to each player rather than only one.  The Cretan Phaistos Disc may have been a Mehen board, but that remains speculation.&#10;&#10;Mehen is the only multi-player ancient Egyptian board game known, the others (Senet, Aseb, Hounds &amp; Jackals, etc.) being all two-player games.  The main function of the serpent-shaped Egyptian god Mehen was to protect the sun-god Ra from his enemies by coiling around him.  In the Old Kingdom, the race-game Mehen took the name and shape of the god: a coiled serpent with the gaming spaces on its back.  As &quot;bodyguard&quot;, Mehen symbolises the sun-god's immediate neighborhood for the deceased.  The deceased walks towards Ra on the back of the serpent-god.&#10;&#10;By the early Middle Kingdom, the &lsquo;cuts&rsquo; used on the snake's back of the Mehen board to separate the playing spaces were thought to &lsquo;kill&rsquo; the snake &mdash;which would have been a very threatening and evil thing.  Mehen&rsquo;s role was essential, for if Ra were not protected from his enemies, he might not rise in the morning, which would result in the cessation of all life.  In Egyptian belief, &lsquo;life&rsquo; applied not only to the living but also to the dead, who were believed to travel with the sun and to rise, reborn, with him at dawn.  From that time forth, the game apparently ceased to be played, possibly banned and forbidden.&#10;&#10;";-3000;5.35;1.0;2;6;20;5;Abstract Strategy, Racing

4168;Blitzkrieg;"Blitzkrieg is one of Avalon Hill's earlier releases, and is a classic hex and counter board game. The game is a fictional representation of the breakout of World War II. Five minor countries become engulfed in a tremendous conflict for territory waged by Great Blue and Big Red, the major antagonists.  Units represented are infantry, airborne, rangers, armor, artillery, fighters and bombers. Naval action is included but abstracted. &#10;Rules are introduced at three levels: the basic game, the advanced game, and a tournament game, as well as optional rules players can include as they choose. The advanced game adds special unit abilities, supply restrictions, air war and strategic bombing, naval invasions, commando raids, special desert supply restrictions, etc. Tournament play was intended for play at game conventions such as the annual world board-gaming convention in Harrisburg, Pa.&#10;&#10;&#10;The nice thing about Blitzkrieg is that it uses a system that is similar to most other hex and counter games, so once one learns one game, the learning curve of a similar game is not as steep. Such is the case with many of the old Avalon Hill Classics.  Once you learned one game all of the others played the same way with some minor variation, only the campaign is different.&#10;&#10;The basic play used unit types and combat ratings. As expected, infantry would have different abilities from armor or artillery. Each unit had ratings printed in large print on the piece, (&quot;chits&quot; or counters as they are called). For example, take a 1-4 infantry brigade. The &quot;4&quot; is the movement factor per turn, so the unit can move four hexes in clear terrain per turn. Movement along a road is 1/3, so a 1-4 infantry can move 12 hexes if moved solely along a road. Each side is permitted to move all of their units up to their full movement allowance. The first rating, the &quot;1&quot; in this case, is the combat factor. Combat is worked out in odds, so that if one moves his 1-4 infantry next to the enemies&rsquo; 1-4 infantry, the combat odds are 1-1 (not very good in combat). There is nothing preventing one from ganging up on an enemy unit, and in fact this is the general tactic even in real life. So if one brought up another brigade into the attack there would be two 1-4 infantry brigades against the enemy's single brigade for 2-1 odds. For example, if the enemy had a 4-4 infantry division sitting on a clear hex and on their turn a player brings up three 4-4 infantry divisions adjacent to have combat, this would be at 12-4 odds, which reduce to 3-1. Then one would consult the combat results table under the 3-1 column and roll the die. The results would resolve the combat and tell what losses there were, and who had to retreat. Obviously, higher odds will favor that side.&#10;&#10;Also in combat, terrain affects combat. A defender in a city or mountain would have their defense rating doubled. For example, a 1-4 infantry in the mountains would defend as a combat rating of 2. Odds are rounded in favor of the defender. From the example above if that 4-4 infantry was defending in a city against those three 4-4 infantry, the odds would now be 12-8, only 1-1 odds (better bring up more attacking troops).&#10;&#10;When Blitzkrieg came out this type of map wargame was relatively new, so this game was very novel in its time. It is still a good two player game and there is enough variation so it won't get stale. It has a WWII or early cold war feel to it. The two antagonists are abstract, Big Red and Great Blue, which had more to do with the simple printing colors Avalon Hill used back in the early 1960's than any national commentary.&#10;&#10;In the late seventies and eighties many panned Blitzkrieg since many games seemed to grind to a stalemate in the middle of the map. But as a training game this isn't such a bad thing, since that can give a new gamer some confidence to play to a draw.&#10;&#10;";1965;5.97232;2.7115;2;2;90;12;Wargame, World War II
4169;Deathtrap Dungeon: Card Game;"The Deathtrap Dungeon card game came with some copies of the PC version of the Deathtrap Dungeon computer game by EIDOS. The cards themselves feature a whole host of nasties, including Skeletons, Orcs and Bloodbeasts. The game is actually based on an ancient Chinese card game called &quot;Zheng Shang Yu&quot;.&#10;&#10;The goal of Deathtrap Dungeon is to 'kill' all the monsters by discarding cards, all of which have a creature on them. The quicker you do it the better. All the cards are dealt out and the player who gets the 'Exploding Pig' starts by discarding the Pig and another card.&#10;&#10;Players arrange their cards into sets, e.g. Orcs, Skeletons, Bloodbeasts etc, and the first player puts down any number of cards from the same set, face up. The next player can then play if they can put down the same number of cards, but with a higher value. Therefore Four Skeletons, which are worth 3 each, could be followed by Four Warriors, which are worth 5 each. If a player cannot do this, they pass and play moves on to the next player.&#10;&#10;The winner of the hand is the last player to put down the set with the highest value. This person then starts the next round. A note is made of the order the players finish in, and they are then ranked:&#10;&#10;Winner = The Big Hero! &#10;2nd place = The Hero &#10;2nd to last place = The Wimp &#10;Last place = The Total Wimp!&#10;&#10;The cards are shuffled and re-dealt for the second round, but before the game begins again, The Total Wimp must hand over their 2 highest cards to The Big Hero and the Big Hero gives back any two of their cards. This also happens with The Wimp and The Hero. The game continue until 4 rounds have been played.&#10;&#10;There are also Special cards in the deck. Also included are Chaindog and Red Lotus, two player characters from the computer game, and can be used to add to any set, however played on their own they have a value of 0. The Killing Machine, which can be played on its own at any time, stops a hand, the player that used it begins the next hand.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.65;0.0;4;8;60;0;Card Game, Fantasy

4172;Veracruz: U.S. Invasion of Mexico 1847;"Veracruz: U.S. Invasion of Mexico, was originally published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #63. Veracruz is an operational simulation of General Winfield Scott's Mexican campaign, which took place between March and September 1847. The invasion was an American effort to end the Mexican War by marching into the heart of Central Mexico to capture the capital, Mexico City. Diplomatically, it ended the decades of border disputes and opened up vast new territories, which in turn led to the Gold Rush of '49 and the Great Compromise of 1850.&#10;&#10;European commanders and military experts, when viewing the upcoming conflict in 1846, could not see anything but a complete Mexican victory, given the size of her army with it's European system of training and assembly. But the European System was a hollow shell that worked with even less validity in the rigid hierarchical Mexican social structure. The entire system was exacerbated by a succession of generals and other leaders who were inept on a scale that dwarfs even the darkest Union days of the Civil War. On the other hand, many of the best generals of the American Civil War distinguished themselves here as lieutenants and captains: Robert E. Lee (engineers, Scott's chief scout), Ulysses S. Grant, George Pickett, Thomas J. Jackson, Braxton Bragg, Jubal Early, George G. Meade, Phillip Kearney, David D. Porter (USN), and Jefferson Davis, to name a few.&#10;&#10;The map depicts central Mexico down to Mexico City, the target of the American player. Players have to deal with supply and a complex set of morale rules. Counters represent basic units, horses, naval units, leaders and a US dummy unit. Other counters indicate supply, unit effectiveness, fortifications, cities and various status counters.&#10;&#10;Special rules for Yellow Fever ( 2000 U.S. soldiers died in combat conditions but over 11,000 died of disease), Limited Intelligence, Morale, Mexican Political Climate, Navy Gunboats, and Mexican Guerrillas.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1 week&#10;Hex: 5 miles&#10;Units: Company to Regiments&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 21 x 33&quot; map&#10;One countersheet (200 1/2&quot; dual-side printed counters)&#10;One 26-page Rules booklet&#10;&#10;";1977;6.0375;3.0455;2;2;360;12;Post-Napoleonic, Wargame

4176;Armies of Arcana;"Armies of Arcana is a set of miniature rules for fantasy figures, along the same lines as Warhammer Fantasy Battle but with a different focus in way play is balanced.  The rules accommodate both 15mm and 25mm figures.&#10;&#10;From publisher (Nov 2009):&#10;Armies of Arcana 5th Edition Softcover Rule book (Published by Terrain Warehouse)&#10;&#10;Armies of Arcana, fifth edition is a major revamp of the fourth and is in full colour. It contains 132 pages including templates and reference charts.&#10;&#10;Though this is a new edition it has not reworked the original rules only reorganised the layout for better reading. Most sections have been rewritten with the purpose of clarity.&#10;&#10;The fourth edition was published in 2002 and as such was not a true fourth version of the rules more of a combining of the three separate editions. The fifth edition brings the publication up to today&rsquo;s high standards.&#10;&#10;So what&rsquo;s different or new, what have we done? Well the main thing we have done is to combined the last few years of work on the forum with the existing edition and to expand the scope of the concept which is Arcana.&#10;&#10;The fifth edition will not come alone it now comes complete with a new Armies of Acrana website.&#10; The Book&#10;&#10;First it&rsquo;s now all colour with a new foreword and introduction in which we expanded the background of Arcana to give it some extra meaning. Then the book is divided into sections, the first is the basics principles with a new learn to play section for those who are new to wargaming.&#10;&#10;The second section contains all the turn sequences reworked to follow the actual turn sequence. Again some sections have been updated to follow what has been developed for the forum, especially the flying section.&#10;&#10;The next section is &lsquo;To Battle&rsquo; - this has had a major reworking. We have added terrain generators, a new scenario - Attrition, tournament rules. In the army building section we have revamped the vehicle, war machine and creature creation parts all now carry example of how to make them and are much easier to read and use.&#10;&#10;The spells have had little done to them other than some realigning by Thane.&#10;&#10;The last section contains the army lists and templates. There are now 23 official army lists plus the monsters list.&#10;&#10;";1997;7.78936;2.6667;2;8;120;0;Fantasy, Miniatures, Wargame

4178;Kaliko;"An abstract strategy game of tile laying played with hexagonal tiles. Each tile has path segments of one, two, or three colors (red, white, or blue), and must be added to the existing layout so that paths on the tile connect with like-colored paths in the layout. Building new paths (by connecting the ends of existing paths) scores points equal to the length (in tiles) of each path built, with a three-point bonus for a path that crosses itself. Making a closed path doubles its score.&#10;&#10;A tricky, difficult, and rewarding game, and also, in the first two editions of Kaliko (in which the tiles are made of Lucite) an exceptionally beautiful one.

As elegant and direct as Chess. &#10;2. Included the intricacies and intrigue of governmental, business, military and geo-political relations.&#10;&#10;Like Chess, HexiMerosTM consists of players alternately moving playing pieces with the object of winning.  Like the strategy games, HexiMerosTM provides opportunities for alliances, betrayals, making friends and enemies.  Unlike Chess, a Sovereign may be captured and removed from the board.  Unlike the strategy games, everything that happens around the play area and away from the play area is part of the game.&#10;&#10;The game of HexiMerosTM is played between six opponents who move their pieces alternately on a hexagonal board.  The player with the Silver pieces commences the game. A player is said to &quot;have the Move&quot; when he is in possession of the Token.  The object of the game is to be the last Sovereign on the board.  The players do this by placing other opponents Sovereigns &quot;under attack&quot;, in such a way that the opponent Sovereign may be captured by himself or any other player.  This is repeated until there is only one Sovereign remaining on the board.  The player who achieves this goal is said to be the last Sovereign standing and to have won the game. Each player whose Sovereign has been captured has lost the game.&#10;&#10;If the position is such that neither of the last two Sovereigns can be captured, the game is drawn between these two players.  The other players have still lost the game.&#10;&#10;";2002;0.0;0.0;6;6;360;8;Abstract Strategy
4183;Double Dog Dare;"Double Dog Dare is a card game in which players draw and play cards to summon fantasy monsters to fight each other.&#10;&#10;The game's combat mechanic is based on an elemental &quot;rock-scissors-paper&quot; cycle: fire trumps earth, which trumps air, and air is superior to water, which overwhelms fire.  Two monsters of equal power would resolve the battle based on their elements; a monster of an element can, however, defeat a much weaker opponent that is of a superior element.  Special and Orbit cards affect the game in other ways, preventing an opponent from attacking for a turn, forcing a player to discard a card, and such.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player has no more cards in hand or in front of him or her; the winner of the game is the other player.&#10;&#10;";1997;6.0;0.0;2;2;45;10;Card Game

Some gangsters have natural affinities for each other; if you manage to put together a &quot;compatible&quot; gang, the victory condition is lowered for you and the gang gets a bonus when pulling off jobs.&#10;&#10;Jobs are resolved by rolling a varying number of dice (depending on the job's difficulty) against your gang's total in Cunning, Charm and/or Combat.

4193;War of the Sky Cities;"After centuries of fighting, man finally accomplished what he had attempted for centuries: the destruction of the world he lived on.  After the last and greatest war, some people survived underground.  But radiation had penetrated even there and they were forced from their new homes.  They rebuilt their great cities as floating platforms to carry them above the radiation belts that now encircled their planet.  Some launched themselves to safety before it was too late, but others were slow or miscalculated.  Their sky born heirs were mutated, some horribly beyond belief, others invisibly.  The centuries passed and the radioactivity began to fade away.  The sky cities began to look for ways downward to the planet.  But they found each other first, humans and non-humans, as allies or competitors.  Then started what man had left off: WAR.&#10;&#10;You are the ruler of a sky-city.  Your objective is to capture or destroy your enemies, and find an opening in the radiation belts.  The action occurs in the upper atmosphere, about 55 to 75 miles off the surface of the Earth.&#10;&#10;WAR OF THE SKY CITIES is an exciting two-player science fiction table top game, where players become rulers of complete cities in the sky.  Each side has small scout/research centers, medium battle cities, and/or large battle cities.  There are two objectives: capture or destroy your enemies and find an opening in the deadly radiation belts surrounding a future Earth.  In addition, optional rules introduce the use of small fighter craft and airborne landing parties.  WAR OF THE SKY CITIES is a game of tactical &quot;air&quot; combat, but instead of aircraft you command large floating cities with their own engines, armour and weapons.&#10;&#10;The components include two pages of cardstock counters and a cardstock reference sheet (printed on one side).&#10;&#10;Game Scale: Each inch represents 200 miles.&#10;&#10;";1979;4.22222;0.0;2;2;120;12;Miniatures, Science Fiction, Wargame
4194;Conquest of North America;"Multi-player board game set in the time of European colonization of North America.  Indian confederations (the Algonquin, Cherokee and Iroquois) and colonist groups (Dutch, English, Spanish and French) compete for control of America.&#10;&#10;Conquest of North America is a Diplomacy variant.  Components include 22&quot; by 35&quot; map, over 200 counters and rules book.&#10;&#10;This was Fantasy Games Unlimited's second attempt at producing a boardgame based on the mechanics of Diplomacy (the first was War of the Ring).  This one was produced quite a bit more economically.  It was sold in a bag, rather than a box, and has a map that is printed on heavy stock paper rather than being a rigid cardboard gameboard.&#10;&#10;";1978;6.5;0.0;7;7;360;12;American Indian Wars, Bluffing, Negotiation, Political, Wargame
4196;Fantasy Forest;"A children's fantasy game from the makers of Dungeons & Dragons Adventure Game.  Each player is a young elf traveling through Fantasy Forest.  In the middle of the forest is the Magic Mountain where Morley the Wizard lives.  The first player to reach Morley's castle wins.&#10;&#10;Players are dealt a hand of three cards.  Cards show a monster type and a number.  They are used to move your elf ahead on the path or to challenge another player to a duel.  Playing the right color cards at certain points on the board allows a player to take shortcuts.&#10;&#10;Red spots on the board are ambush spaces.  Players landing there must play a card face-up from their hand and then draw the top card off the deck.  If the player's card is higher than the drawn card, they move forward the number of spaces equal to their card's number.  If their card is lower than the drawn card, they move backwards the number of spaces equal to the drawn card's number.&#10;&#10;Duels are handled the same way, only they are between players and the winner gets to move to the space in front of the losing player (assuming it is forward movement along the path).  In this way players are never really out of the running because they can challenge the leader anytime they draw a strong card.&#10;&#10;";1982;6.17594;1.1765;2;4;30;5;Children's Game, Fantasy

Although the siege of Leningrad had been broken, the city was far from secure. This battle was intended to guarantee the Leningrad&rsquo;s safety. The game depicts February 10, 1943, a day which would come to be known to the Spanish as &ldquo;Black Wednesday.&rdquo; The battle is a microcosm of Soviet offensive operations in World War II. Massive bombardment, wave assaults, desperate hedgehog defenses and even more desperate counter-attacks are features of this battle pitting the might of the Soviet army against the brave (but woefully outnumbered) Spanish Blue Division.&#10;&#10;(from the back of the box:)&#10;&#10;History: At the beginning of 1943, the Red Armies facing Army Group North had lifted the siege of  Leningrad. In order to enlarge the lifeline into the city, they attacked thc Axis Forces holding its flanks.&#10; The Spanish Blue: In the euphoria surrounding the German invasion of Russia in 1941 the Spanish government raised an infantry division of volunteers to assist the fight against Bolshevism.&#10;&#10;The Battle: Black Wednesday covers the Battle of Krasni Bor. It begins with a typical Soviet artillery barrage followed by the &quot;Urrah!&quot; of swarms of Soviet infantrymen. The newly anointed 63rd Guards Rifle Division led the attack with support by the 72nd Rifle Division (a former Ukrainian Penal unit) and part of the 43rd Rifle Division. Further support for the attack came from the T&middot;26, T&middot;34, and KV -1 tanks of the 1st Red Banner Tank Brigade. It was a full Soviet combined arms force striking a skilled dug in enemy.&#10;&#10;The Game: Black Wednesday is a full-force TCS treatment of a typical Eastern Front action-massive preparatory barrages against front-line trenches, waves of stubborn Soviet infantrymen, embattled knots of hedgehogged defenders.&#10;&#10;Black Wednesday highlights the doctrine and capabilities of massed Red Army troops and the skill, and elan of the elite Spanish Volunteers.&#10;&#10;Features&#10;&#10;     Streamlined Third Edition Game System with the same series rules as Hunters from the Sky. &#10;     Furious situation as the Soviets make a massed assault, the Spanish conduct a grim defense and the Germans come to counterattack.&#10;     First game ever to allow players to fire the largest Railroad Gun in history - the 800mm Gun DORA-as a variant. &#10;     Player Skill is highly rewarded. &#10;&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 20 minutes&#10;Hex: 125 yards / 114 meters&#10;Units: Infantry platoons, individual vehicles&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium-High&#10;Complexity Level: High&#10;Players: 1 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2-50 hours&#10;&#10;&#10;Game number 7 in the Gamers Tactical Combat Series.

4202;GD '41;"GD '41: is Game number 9 in the Gamers Tactical Combat Series (TCS) by The Gamers and is the second in the series to cover the Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland in World War II. This time the IRGD is driving toward Tula and Moscow.&#10;&#10;The final German attack on Moscow began on 30 September 1941 with the battles of encirclement at Bryansk and Vyazma. Further south, Guderian&rsquo;s Second Panzer Group captured Orel on 3 October without fighting and pushed on to the Zusha River. While Mtzensk fell on 10 October, further advances would have to wait until the pocketed Russians could be eliminated. The Russian 4th Tank and 201st Parachute Brigades had been fighting rear guard actions as the Germans advanced beyond Orel. Mtzensk&rsquo;s defense fell under the newly formed 26th Army composed of the 6th Guard Rifle  Division, 4th and 11th Tank Brigades, 41st Cavalry Division, and the 5th Parachute Corps (three Parachute Brigades). The German drive on Tula resumed on 22 October in spite of the terrible German&#10;supply situation. Russian defenses proved too much for the frontal assault attempted by the 4th Panzer Division, so a combined attack by the 3rd and 4th Panzer Divisions along with Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland was ordered for 23 October.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 20 minutes&#10;Hex: 125 yards / 114 meters&#10;Units: Infantry platoons, individual vehicles&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;Two 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheets&#10;Three dual-side printed countersheets (2 combat, 1 markers - 840 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 28-page TCS version 3.1 system rulebook&#10;One 24-page GD '41 game specific rulebook&#10;Two 4-page TCS version 3.1 Charts &amp; Tables folders&#10;Two Player Aid cards&#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium-High&#10;Players: 1 or more&#10;Playing Time: 1-40 hours&#10;&#10;";1996;7.01405;3.375;1;2;2400;0;Wargame, World War II
4204;Tunisia;"Tunisia: The Tunisian Theater of Operations, November 1942 to May 1943, is about the campaign in Northwest Africa from November, 1942 through May, 1943. It covers the end of the Axis presence on the African continent as well as the death of the Afrika Korps and the surrender of all Axis forces in Africa, May 1943.&#10;&#10;Tunisia is the third game in the Operational Combat Series (OCS) from The Gamers.&#10;&#10;Notice to buyers and sellers: There maybe a discrepancy in the counter manifest depending on when the game was collated.  It has been posted on Consim that because Tunisia had a long run, that the later copies may have a newer version of the of the generic OCS countersheet.&#10;&#10;The original game had four countersheets. The inventory listed in the game specific rule book has the following. Two sheets numbered 1 and 2. These have the unit counters for the various sides depicted in the game. Countersheet 3 has 80 generic OCS makers. Sheet 4 is listed as having 140 counters and has more generic OCS counters.&#10;&#10;From the discussion on Consim it seem that it is possible some copies had the &quot;Countersheet 4&quot; replaced with a sheet labeled &quot;Countersheet OCS Markers&quot;. So be aware that it is possible that there are two different counter mixes for this game. One with the newer version of the generic OCS counters (with 280 counters.)  and the original &quot;Countersheet 4&quot; with a 140 countersheet.

The cards have the name of the location on one side and a map on the other side, showing contiguous locations.&#10;&#10;The object is to void your hand by playing a card with something that shares a borderline with the last card played. Wild cards when played are automatically considered a match and can then be named as any location in the deck except for those in the player's hand. If a player cannot play a contiguous card, cards are drawn from the deck and added to the player's hand until a card can be played.&#10;&#10;Instead of drawing, a player can play a card that does not share a borderline and hope to not be challenged. Challenges can happen after any play. If the challenging player is correct, and the card played does not share a borderline, then the challenged player has to take back the card and take a card from the challenging player's hand. If the challenge is incorrect, the challenger takes a card from the deck and the challenged player gets another turn.&#10;&#10;";1989;4.56;1.0;2;4;20;8;Bluffing, Card Game, Trivia

Battles are resolved by comparing a die roll to the unit's strength for successful hits instead of referring to charts.&#10;&#10;The game ends in 25 turns or if one side has been totally eliminated.

4294;The Thin Red Line: A Game of the Battle of Waterloo;"The Thin Red Line is a detailed tactical treatment of Napoleonic warfare. Waterloo was the final and most decisive land battle of the Napoleonic Wards, and possibly the most famous battle of all time. Napoleonic warfare was complex in its variety, and victory or defeat depended on the successful application of such diverse factors as organization and command control, leadership and training, formation and position, firepower, combined arms tactics, luck, and, especially, morale. These aspects of the Battle of Waterloo are accurately modeled in this game. Can you, as the Iron Duke of Wellington, hold the French at bay until night or the Prussians arrive? Can you, as Blucher, old &quot;Vorwarts,&quot; drive forward in time to save the day?&#10;&#10;Every unit that participated in the historical battle is represented--British, Hanoverian, Dutch-Belgian, Nassau, Brunswick, King's German Legion, French, and Prussian infantry, cavalry, and artillery. The rules cover all the key factors in the battle, line, column, square, and ordere-mixte formations, skirmishers, routing and rallying, leader effects and casualties, cavalry reaction and recall, artillery capture and recapture, hidden units, fatigue, the elan and mobility of the French infantry columns, and the firepower and staying power of the &quot;thin red line&quot; of British infantry.&#10;&#10;Scale: 300 yards per hex; 30 minutes per turn; brigade and division-sized combat units.&#10;&#10;";1979;6.71591;2.75;2;3;180;0;Napoleonic, Wargame

Accurate and playable rules cover the important aspects of the combat such as: formations (column, line, and skirmish), charges, melee, routs, leadership, sharpshooters, morale and the quality of individual regiments and more. The game's mechanics take into account over twenty different weapons types ranging from the standard rifled musket and the twelve pound Napoleon field piece to the breach loading Whitworth rifle. Scenarios include &quot;historical situations&quot; such as Little Round Top and Bloody Angle as well as situations that were &quot;generic&quot; to the war such as meeting engagements and cavalry raids. Battles &amp; Leaders is a game that covers its subject with style and detail but maintains an ease of play while presenting players with the &quot;feel&quot; of the era.&#10;&#10;Includes 509 counters (includes terrain pieces)&#10;&#10;";1981;6.66667;3.25;2;4;180;12;American Civil War, Wargame

4308;The Shakespeare Game;"Victorian game in which each of the 52 cards represents a scene from a Shakespeare play (with fabulous card art!) and has a quote from that play printed on it. It could be played in any of three ways.&#10;In the preferred method, a slightly souped-up version of &quot;Authors,&quot; the player to the left of the dealer reads the quote on one of his cards. If the next player knows which play the quote is from and needs that card for a set of the four scenes from that play, he gets it. Completed sets are laid down on the table, and whoever has the most sets at the end of the game wins.&#10;&quot;When mere amusement is desired and the educational feature not cared for,&quot; the second game play method is the most basic version of &quot;Authors&quot; in which the players ask each other if they have a card for a particularly play. The third game play method is, strangely, a non-bidding four-handed partnered trick-taking game in which the four series of scenes substitute for the four suits in a regular card deck, with the &quot;A&quot; series always being trump.&#10;The maximum number of players for the third method is four. The maximum number for the other methods could be higher, but it might prove difficult to build sets. The approximate playing time is a guess.&#10;Bottom line: I guess they knew their Shakespeare a lot better at the start of the 20th century than we know him at the start of the 21st.&#10;&#10;";1900;2.8;1.0;2;4;20;0;Card Game, Memory

4316;Belter: Mining the Asteroids, 2076;"Economic SF wargame set in the asteroid belt in the year 2076. In the basic game, two, three, or four players control mining companies that mine asteroids for ore, gas, and highly dangerous shards of CT (contra-terrene matter -- a name for antimatter lifted from the Seetee novels of Jack Williamson). These commodities are traded for credits at the three major planetoid stations. Vicious fights can break out over control of particularly lucrative asteroids. The players have to agree on the winning conditions: The winner is either the first player to one million, ten million, or a hundred million credits, or the wealthiest player after a set timespan elapses. (The playing time is, accordingly, completely arbitrary; two hours is probably too short, but seems like a sane number.)&#10;&#10;In the advanced game, an additional player plays the Peace Keeping Force (PKF), whose role is ironically not to stop the fighting, but to suppress revolts and other conflicts just enough to keep prices of ore and gas low. The PKF player achieves partial victory if the price of either commodity is below 200 credits at the end of the game, or decisive victory if the prices of both commodities are below 200 credits.&#10;&#10;Includes: 480 counters&#10;&#10;";1979;6.12273;3.2;2;5;120;12;Economic, Industry / Manufacturing, Science Fiction, Wargame

4333;Rip-Off;"An original card game showing &quot;how the consumer gets ripped off&quot;.  Each player is assigned one of the four categories of businesses, each of which sells goods or services costing 100, 200, 300 or 400 $.  Each player starts with 1000 $.  First player to amass 100 Consumer points wins.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you roll a die.  If it is 1-4, you go visit the corresponding dealer.  If you rolled yourself, you pick one of the three others.  If you rolled 5-6, you draw a Consumer card and then go visit a dealer of your choice.  The Consumer cards give small Consumer Point bonuses or penalties, or small cash awards (up to 500 $).  At the beginning of each round, all players receive 100 $ each.&#10;&#10;Each dealer has six cards, one Catch card, two Rip-Off cards and three Good Deal cards.  They are spread in front of him, face down, in any order of the dealer's choice.  The consumer then decides how much he will spend (100-400 $) and forks the money over to the vendor.  The dealer then rolls a die and picks up the corresponding card (left to right) from his spread; next, he chooses one of the five remaining cards.  Finally, he picks up the card corresponding to the amount spent (100 $ - first card, and so on up to 400 $ - fourth card).  Thus the dealer has limited control over what choice to offer to the consumer.&#10;&#10;The consumer then draws one of the three cards proferred by the dealer (still face down).  If a Good Deal, he receives 10-40 Consumer points.  If a Catch, he receives half as much.  If a Rip-Off, he *loses* 10 Consumer points but has the option of suing.&#10;&#10;To sue, pay 500 $ to the Bank, then dice off against the vendor.  If the consumer rolls lower, he lost the suit.  If he tied or bested the vendor, he is awarded compensation depending on the margin of success.  The least result is that he recovers the lost 10 CPs and is refunded the court costs by the vendor.  The vendor may be forced to pay such a large penalty that he goes into debt.  If your debt gets larger than 1000 $, you are  bankrupt and out of the game.  Whilst in debt, you cannot buy when your turn comes, but instead just draw a Consumer card.  All income goes to pay off the debt.&#10;&#10;";1975;4.33333;2.0;3;4;30;0;Economic

This game attempts to add some humor to the wargame genre.

These values range from 0 to 5, with the Black pieces having stronger values overall. One of the white figures is also secretly designated as Lord Kira, the object of the attack.&#10;&#10;During each turn, you can move all of your samurai figures 1 or 2 spaces. The samurai may also be used to slide an adjacent bamboo screen once during his move. When an enemy samurai enters a space with an opponent&rsquo;s samurai, the players each roll a die and add the result to their samurai's strength value. The player with the lower total is the loser and that figure is removed from the map board. Tie rolls result in both pieces being removed.&#10;&#10;";1983;1.0;2.0;2;2;45;12;Ancient, Fighting

The 101st has battled their way to the small Dutch village of Veghel.  All they need do now is await the arrival of XXX Corps on their way to Nijmegen and beyond to Arnhem. As fate would have it, the Germans planned otherwise. German armor and infantry conducted several determined attacks on the positions held by the 101st.&#10;&#10;Operation Market-Garden is usually best remembered for the stubborn defence of the Arnhem Bridge by the British 1st Airborne.

4351;Global Summit: The Peace Game;"Cooperative card game in which the players represent nations at an international summit pledging economic, political, and social resources to ward off threats to world peace. There are 66 Resource cards of the three varieties in various denominations, 24 Domestic Event cards, and 18 Chaos cards. A game turn consists of drawing Domestic Event cards (which cause Resources to be drawn, discarded, or redistributed), turning over a Chaos card (which threatens the peace and requires an amount of a certain type of Resource to avert), and either passing the Chaos card to the next round or collectively playing Resource cards that total the amount required by the Chaos card in order to neutralize it. If, in ten turns, ten Chaos cards can be neutralized *and* each nation has total resource points equal to or greater than it started with, the players win.&#10;&#10;This game was the first and possibly only one produced (in a limited edition of 500) by Pittsburgh-based Borderland Games, whose name and house logo were derived from the classic fantasy novel &quot;The House on the Borderland&quot; by William Hope Hodgson.&#10;&#10;";1988;5.5;0.0;1;6;30;12;Card Game, Economic, Negotiation, Political
4352;Fightball;"In the all-too-distant future, a bunch of people play a dangerous sport called Fightball, and James Ernest wrote a game about it.&#10;&#10;The setting is the streets of the future &mdash; not the real future, but the crazy apocalyptic future we all know and love. In this particular future, gangs of street thugs have (again) become enamored of the world of modern professional sports. Unfortunately, they have no real idea of how these modern sports were played, besides what they can guess from old photographs and what they know about the sports of their day. If all future sports use multiple balls, surely so did the sports of the twentieth century, right? And even if they didn't, they should have.&#10;&#10;Thus was born Fightball, a weird version of basketball with at least three balls &mdash; maybe more, we're not sure &mdash; two goals, and extremely violent gameplay. The sport is played on the streets and overseen by flying robot referees, and it's played by the weirdest assortment of folks you're likely to see in a game.&#10;&#10;Basically, Fightball is like basketball. Players build a &quot;court&quot; out of 24 cards and play four rounds. The play is fast and furious, with each player playing as fast as he can. When one player reaches the &quot;BUZZ&quot; card (at the bottom of the deck) the round is over. Now, players score each location on the court, looking for a sequence of cards starting with a player, then a ball, then a shot. Other cards, like blockers, can affect the quality of the shot. Some shots succeed, and are worth points. Others fail, and are worth nothing. The highest score at the end of four rounds wins the game!&#10;&#10;Fightball was released as three sets of double decks, and any two decks can be played against one another.&#10;&#10;";2002;5.84535;2.12;2;2;20;12;Card Game, Fantasy, Real-time, Sports
4353;Vector 3: Tactical Space Combat in Three Dimensions;"Two-player SF wargame positing a space war in the &quot;Gilgamesh Cluster&quot; between the &quot;humano-cetacean civilization&quot; and the &quot;Xandri-Bratcom Coalition.&quot; The war is fought with modular Vector 3 ships that can carry an assortment of pods: lasers, torpedo launchers, defensive-screen generators, and tractor/pressor beams. Ship movement is Newtonian and three-dimensional: (X,Y) and (X,Z) position charts are used to track where the ships are at any given time.  Players spend ship points to buy ship components and technology points to buy improved technologies; victory points are earned for destroying pods and ships and for being the last player to have ships in play. When all of one player's ships have been destroyed or warped out, the player with the highest victory point total wins.&#10;&#10;Four scenarios are suggested with differing allowed technologies and different numbers of starting ship and technology points. The approximate playing time is a guess; it will depend on the chosen scenario.&#10;&#10;This is Space Capsule #4, the fourth in SPI's series of science fiction microgames.&#10;&#10;";1979;5.37564;2.3333;2;2;0;0;Print & Play, Science Fiction, Wargame

4355;Therapy;"This is a game with a basis in psychology. Players go through six phases of life answering trivia questions related to these phases. If they land on a therapy praxis, they have to answer not-too-intimate therapy-questions about themselves instead. For these therapy-questions, the other players have to guess the answer, either alone (therapy in their praxis) or in consensus with the other players (group therapy). Through these therapy questions, most games will result in surprising revelations; you will get to know your friends/ game buddies/ ... a bit better.&#10;&#10;As in Trivial Pursuit and The Game of Life, Therapy is a race to collect six pieces (one for each of the six phases of life). Pieces are not only granted for correctly answering questions, but also for guessing what your fellow players answer while they are in therapy.  Depending on the version, you will play with different unusual playing pieces (e.g. tiny psychiatry couches and brain lobes).&#10;&#10;Recommended for Ages 16 and up&#10;&#10;";1986;5.36506;1.4107;3;6;90;16;Medical, Party Game, Trivia

The player who launches the most powerful primates home to Earth by game end will claim victory.&#10;&#10;Every move that a player makes will impress one of the six monkey tribes yet anger another.

As the Central Powers player YOU control the armies of Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey, and make the difficult strategic decisions the two-front war requires. As the Allied player YOU command the forces of the rest of Europe Including Britain, France, Russia. Italy, Belgium, Rumania, Serbia, and the United States, and carry the burden of forcing back the strongly entrenched enemy corps on both the west and eastern fronts. No other game presents so great a challenge to test each player's grasp of military strategy.&#10; Ten Historical Scenarios From the summer of 1914 through the final surrender on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day and month of 1918, GUNS OF AUGUST spans the entire First World War in monthly Game-Turns; each player maneuvers hundreds of infantry and cavalry corps and their supporting artillery and engineer regiments. And in addition to this mammoth campaign game, separate scenarios for each front during each year of the war, which can be combined into two-front scenarios for 1914, 1915, 1916, and 1917, have been specially designed to allow players to vary the size, difficulty, and playing time of their games.&#10;&#10;For those who think that World War I Is an unexciting subject for a game, GUNS OF AUGUST will prove a shock comparable to the appearance of British tanks at Cambrai, and German stosstrupen at Caporetto.&#10;&#10;COMPLEXITY: Rated &quot;5&quot; on a scale of 1 (easy) to 10 (hard) &#10;1040 Counters&#10;&#10;(BGG description :)&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill's definitive World War I game.  &#10;Comes with 4 mapboard panels showing all of the major theaters of the war to end all wars.

4370;Fische Fluppen Frikadellen;"What a fuss. The frightfully fearsome feudal lord Fieso has held the fascinating fairy Fabula in captivity since the famous February festivities. In order to free the fairy must you redeem her from the Fieso's fetid and fusty feculent fetter. Frustrated you flee into the Finnish fjords in order to fetch a few of the fascinating fetishes so highly favored by the foul prince. Frantically you begin bartering with the local folks: a few Florins will get you some Fish which can be traded for Flowers, which again can be traded for Fur, Fruits, Flutes, Fettucine, Furniture, Fuel, Fiddles or maybe even a fridge. When your finances allow you to obtain 3 different fetishes you have won the game.&#10;&#10;In Fische Fluppen Frikadellen, players are traders running (or sailing on a raft!) around a town, visiting various market stalls in order to buy, sell, or trade goods.  There are three different types of stalls in the game.  Merchants will sell you a specific good of the 5 base goods in the game according to current market prices, and will also buy a specific good from you, also according to market prices.  Traders will accept a specific good and give you two of a specific good in return.  Finally, there are dealer stalls which offer fetishes.  They each want specific combinations of goods, offering you a fetish in return.  There are three different fetishes in the game, and the first player to trade for all three fetishes wins!&#10;&#10;Furthermore, whenever a player visits a market stall, a special ability of that stall activates.  These special abilities cause all sorts of game events, such as production of goods at merchants (you can't buy a good at a merchant if he doesn't have any available), price increases of goods, getting an extra turn or free commodity, changing the position of two merchants, etc.  Often times, players will need to utilize these special abilities to conquer their goals.&#10;&#10;The really unique feature of Fische Fluppen Frikadellen is that there are three different versions of the game, so it can be played by up to 15 people on three different, interconnected tables!  You'll need one copy of the game for every 5 players.&#10;&#10;At the start of a 15-player game, for example, there will be three boards, with 5 players at each board.  Each board is set up individually by the players starting there, and there are 36 merchants in the game with only 12 of them used per board, so it is very possible for each board to be significantly different than the others!  Furthermore, there will only be one of the three fetishes available at each board, so players will need to sail off to all three boards over the course of the game in order to win!  This means picking up all of your things and moving to a different table.&#10;&#10;You aren't allowed to peek at the other tables before you move, which means it is a complete surprise what the market conditions and various stalls will be on the board that you move to.  This mechanic also means that there will not always be an equal amount of players at each board throughout the game, so players at boards with less players will likely get turns more frequently than players at boards with more players; another reason to leave your current board for a different one!&#10;&#10;";2002;6.58012;2.5376;2;5;90;10;Economic
4371;Last Man Standing;"Each player chooses one of eight characters that spoof popular spy/action-movie characters or actors: James Blonde, Emma Shell, Austin Flowers, Indiana Smith, Jackie Chang, Dirty Larry, Shift, or Arnold Weissenmeiner. They wander around a sort of super-generic indoor area with corridors, rooms, and safes (somebody's HQ? no villains are in evidence), trying to wipe each other out with their character abilities and the weapons and specials they find in the safes. Obviously enough, the last man (or woman, or team) standing wins. Reminiscent of &quot;Frag,&quot; but with more complicated mechanisms.&#10;&#10;The modular boards are square grids on the same scale as most of Jolly Roger's other games; in fact, the boards for &quot;Orcs at the Gates&quot; and &quot;Maul of America&quot; can be used with this game.&#10;&#10;Approximate playing time is totally arbitrary; it will vary depending on the number of players, the size of the playing area, and so forth.

If you can cover 3 or 4 symbols, you immediately get another turn. The first player to run out of cards wins. Rules are included in 15 different languages, and advanced rules are included to make the game more strategic, faster, cutthroat, or all three.&#10;&#10;";2002;5.48596;1.125;2;10;30;0;Abstract Strategy, Card Game
4373;Operation Felix;"Game on the invasion of Gibraltar by the Germans in 1940/41. This game was published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #153, along with Zama.&#10;&#10;Operation Felix is a &quot;what if...&quot; game on the invasion of Gibraltar by the Germans in 1940/41, shortly after the fall of France. Historically, it was the option Hitler elected against, putting political calculations ahead of military realities in his attempt to dominate Europe. This recasting of history assumes that Hitler made the defeat of Britain his top priority in 1940-41. Instead of angling for negotiations with His Majesty's government after Dunkirk, The Fuhrer issues orders to German High Command to take the war to the Commonwealth wherever it could. The one obvious target that is close at hand, and has considerable military and political value, is the Rock of Gibraltar, the gateway to the western Mediterranean Sea.&#10;&#10;Scenarios cover a July 1940 attack, the more probable December 1940 invasion, and a Spanish assault (with a little help from German allies). Optional rules for SS reinforcements and greater German amphibious capacity.&#10;&#10;Game scale:&#10;hex scale = 250 meters/hex side to side &#10;time = one day per game turn &#10;strength = platoon/company/battalion sized units&#10;&#10;";1992;4.83418;2.4;1;2;90;16;Wargame, World War II

If you think you want to be king, start a revolution and hope you get as many players behind you to win the crown and the victory-points that go along with it.  If the other players decide to stand behind the king you lose this attack and the victory - points are for the king and his helpers only.&#10;&#10;This is a boardgame with cards for building and fighting.

4376;Kings in the Corner;"&quot;Kings go in the corners. Play your cards solitaire fashion and extend your turn as long as you can. Can't make a single play? Pay the pot. First to empty your hand? You win the pot...plus your opponents' point chips for their unplayed cards! Reach 100 points? You win the game.&quot;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Each round, the players shuffle a regular card deck (included), deal out hands of 7 cards and divide up 80 chips among themselves. The shared central playing field is seeded with 4 cards. In turns, each player places cards from their hand into the central field using typical solitaire rules of alternating suit colors and strictly sequential cards in declining value order. Any kings cards in the initial deal or drawn later are placed in the &quot;corner&quot; slots at the player's first opportunity. Solitaire card chains are placed in descending order on the kings.&#10;&#10;In the retail version the central playing field is a plastic hub which has four &quot;king&quot; slots and four &quot;tabbed&quot; slots for the available places to build the chains of cards.&#10;&#10;&quot;After one player wins the hand by being the first to get rid of all his/her cards, the other players put one chip in the pot for each of the cards remaining in their hand. The winner of the hand receives all the chips in the pot and records the number of chips for his/her score. Each chip is worth one point. All the chips are then collected to be redistributed for the next hand to be played. The first player to accumulate 100 points is the winner of the game.&quot;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;The game length can vary quite a bit to get to 100 points for one player.&#10;&#10;";1996;5.17362;1.1143;2;6;30;7;Card Game, Children's Game

4378;Cootie;"Players race to construct a plastic bug, rolling a die to see which piece they get to add.&#10;&#10;The Hennepin History Museum states that the first Cootie game was designed by William H. Schaper in 1949. However, Schaper's game was not the first based upon the insect known as the &quot;cootie&quot;. The creature was the subject of several tabletop games, mostly pencil and paper games, in the decades of the twentieth century following World War I.&#10;&#10;In 1927, the J. H. Warder Company of Chicago released Tu-Tee, and the Charles Bowlby Company released Cootie; though based on a &quot;build a bug&quot; concept similar to Schaper's, both were paper and pencil games.&#10;Schaper's game was the first to employ a fully three dimensional, free-standing plastic cootie.&#10;&#10;Known in Australia as Creepy Critters and in the UK as Beetle Drive.&#10;&#10;";1927;3.4124;1.0227;2;4;20;3;Animals, Children's Game, Dice

Based on the science fiction movies of the 1950s, especially They Came From Outer Space, the cover also shows three well-developed women in pedal-pushers, pumps, and low-cut blouses caught in the clutches of tentacled creatures with large eyes and crunching mouth parts.&#10;&#10;Two scenarios from 1951 are included. In one, the Bug-Eyed Monsters land in Freedom, New Hampshire to capture women, who have Pulchritude ratings from 1 to 6, and to knock out the men.

4380;Dillinger: The Mid-West Crime Wave, 1931-1934;"The Midwest Crime Wave; 1931 - 1934&#10;&#10;DILLINGER is for 3 to 6 players and, although it uses the actual participants and history of the era in some detail, the game is not a historical recreation. It has been designed, and play tested to a virtual fare-thee-well, to bring about 2 to 3 hours of continual fun for the players.  All players are involved in every player's turn, so there is no &quot;down time.&quot; In essence, while one player is robbing a bank, the others become the Law Enforcement aspect of the game, trying to stop him with roadblocks, tear gas, gun molls, tommy guns, and whatever else they can throw in his path.&#10;&#10;If the Bad Guy (there are 20 historical &quot;Bad Guys&quot; from Dillinger, to Jelly Nash, Pretty Boy Floyd, Baby Face Nelson, the incredible Barkers, the inept Kelly's, and the truly creepy Alvin Karpis, all rated for a variety of capabilities) succeeds he not only pockets the take, but he gains Notoriety. And accumulating Notoriety is what the players are doing to win. Obviously a successful kidnapping (a rare event) will bring loads of Points, but convicting another Bad Guy with your in-house mouthpiece (again, real-life lawyers, from the great trial attorney, Sam Leibowitz to the down-and-dirty Louis Piquett) can also get you some Notoriety. Opportunities to amass points are ubiquitous, and winning games usually comes right down to the end.&#10;&#10;Each game of DILLINGER includes 1 Rules Folder, 1 Background information Folder, 110 Player Cards, 5 Location Mats, lots of Funny Money, and one small sheet of Mike Lemick colorful cut-and-paste counters.&#10;&#10;";2002;6.58333;0.0;3;6;120;0;Card Game

4386;Fanorona;"Fanorona is a classical two-person strategic abstract game that comes from the island of Madagascar and is still popular there today. It is played on a rectangular board made up of two Alquerque boards with 22 plain black and white pieces. Capturing is compulsory and a series of captures may be made by the same piece on a turn, as in checkers. Unique aspects of the game include its method of capture (either approaching or withdrawing your piece from a line of enemy pieces), and the &quot;vela partie&quot; (debt game) after winning a decisive game (the winner must let the loser &quot;eat&quot; one man each turn for 17 consecutive moves). Because of the density of the board (only one open spot at the games beginning) and the unique method of capture, strategy is complex and enigmatic, with fewer pieces often beating more pieces. (While very different, the game feels somewhat like Zertz due to the above.)&#10;&#10;Historical note from one game box: Some Fanorona matches were devoted to the Gods and last but not least the fate and colonialization of Madagascar (1895) supposed to be solved unbloody with Fanorona on the game table.&#10;&#10;";1680;6.40763;2.5217;2;2;20;7;Abstract Strategy, Children's Game
4388;Rome: Imperium, Circus Maximus, Hannibal vs Rome;"Reiner Knizia has designed a number of games set in Ancient Rome. This collection brings together three of the finest, covering three very different aspects of the Roman Empire: Hannibal versus Rome, Imperium and Circus Maximus.&#10;&#10;Hannibal versus Rome is a 30-minute two-player game depicing the initial struggle for supremacy between Rome and Carthage, which finally established Rome as the leading power in the Mediterranean. It draws on the events of the Second Punic War, during which Hannibal crossed the Alps with his elephants, and defeated Rome in the battle of Cannae. The Roman general Scipio succeeded in moving the fighting away from Italy, into Spain and Africa, where he defeated the Carthaginians at Zama.&#10;&#10;The map covers the Western Mediterranean. Players move Legions and Fleets, deciding conflicts by the use of cards in order to determine who will be the dominant power in the Mediterranean region.&#10;&#10;Imperium (a game for two to five players) focuses on Rome's political and territorial expansion during the Imperial period. Powerful families controlled the individual provinces in order to increase their wealth and power in Rome, until the Roman Empire reached its zenith in size in the year 100 under the Emperor Trajan.&#10;&#10;In each round the two to five players distribute markers onto areas of the Empire, with control of one area being decided each round. The players need to have the right influence at the decisive moment to take control, without neglecting long-term development. It is a game of planning and timing.&#10;&#10;Circus Maximus leads us into the heart of Rome itself with its renowned public entertainment for the masses; chariot racing.&#10;&#10;Chariot races were immensely popular in Rome. The Circus Maximus offered room for 200,000 spectators who avidly followed the races, roaring and cheering on their favourites. The courageous charioteers were divided into teams distinguished by different colours. The most successful were worshipped as heroes, but the risks were high and many paid for their fame and daring with their lives.&#10;&#10;Each of two to five players controls a team of three chariots. In a game of pure tactics, players receive five movement cards that they can assign each turn to individual chariots as they wish. The first to bring all three across the finish line wins the game and the laurel wreath.&#10;&#10;Note: the 3 games in this were previously released in Neue Spiele im alten Rom.&#10;&#10;";2001;6.30407;1.7097;2;5;60;8;Ancient, Card Game, Political, Racing
4390;Carcassonne: Hunters and Gatherers;"Carcassonne: Hunters and Gatherers is a standalone game in the Carcassonne series set in the stone age.&#10;&#10;As in other Carcassonne games, players take turns placing tiles to create the landscape and placing meeples to score points from the map they're creating. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Instead of cities, roads, and farms, Carcassonne: Hunters and Gatherers has forests, rivers, lakes, and meadows. Players' meeples can represent hunters (when placed in the meadows), gatherers (in a forest), or fishermen (on a river segment). They also have huts, which can be placed on rivers or lakes to get fish from the entire river system.&#10;&#10;It includes many of the familiar mechanics from Carcassonne with a few new rules, including:&#10;- A player who completes a forest with a gold nugget in it gets to immediately draw and place 1 of 12 bonus (menhir) tiles.&#10;- A meadow is worth 2 points for every animal in it, except tigers, which negate certain other animals.&#10;- A river segment is worth the number of tiles in the segment plus the number of fish in the lakes at each end.&#10;- A fishing hut scores at the end of the game and is worth the number of fish in all the lakes connected by rivers.&#10;&#10;The Devir edition includes (the relevant part of) the Carcassonne: King & Scout expansion&#10;&#10;In the 2020 edition &#10;- Some of The Scout special tiles are transformed into menhir tiles of which there are more now.&#10;- A deer scores 1 point, an aurochs 2 points and a mammoth 3 points on meadows. &#10;- Rivers score for fish in the river segments as well, not only the fish in the lakes at each end. Fishing huts likewise.&#10;- Players each get 3 huts instead of just 2.&#10;&#10;";2002;7.13552;1.9219;2;5;35;8;Prehistoric, Territory Building
4391;Magefire;"Fantasy board/card game in which the players are wizards fighting for control of an arena whose concentric circles yield progressively greater magic power. (There is also a very strong source of power that moves randomly around the board.) Wizards can make direct physical attacks on one another, cast offensive or movement spells (using two shared Fate decks -- cheaper and weaker Primary Fate cards and stronger and more expensive Secondary Fate cards), or summon elementals to fight on their behalf. The last player with a wizard or elemental left in the arena wins.&#10;&#10;The approximate playing time is a guess and will probably depend on the number of players and their temperament.&#10;&#10;The designer created this game when he was a sophomore at Booker T.

4394;The Settlers of the Stone Age;"Based on the award-winning CATAN, but presenting players with all-new challenges unique to the dangers and opportunities of the Stone Age.&#10;&#10;From the Box: &#10;Man's Epic Struggle. The cradle of modern humans, called Homo sapiens by scientists, was located in Africa more than 100,000 years ago. The first branches of this family began a journey that spanned thousands of years. Eventually leading them to Australia and America. The enormous difficulties of this journey were overcome because of Homo sapiens' unique ability to adapt to its environment. Their highly developed brains and their mastery of crafts enabled them to flourish in even the harshest conditions.&#10;&#10;In this exciting game, you will guide the journey of one of these branches. You must strive to spread your people over the whole world. In order to expand your branch of humanity, you must develop certain talents: advances in the preparation of food will allow your people to spread faster and wider, while new hunting techniques can protect them from dangers. And your people will need warm clothes to cross the ice deserts of the north and boats to settle Australia.&#10;&#10;Of course, all of this is possible only if you have enough raw materials: meat, hides, bones and flint.&#10;&#10;There are many paths that you may follow to victory. But it is certain that the player that settles in the most productive lands, trades for missing raw materials with the other players most skillfully, and is able to best penetrate the lands of Australia and America, will end the game with their nose in front!&#10;&#10;Belongs to the Catan Series and is retroactively a member of Catan Histories.&#10;&#10;";2002;6.56334;2.5163;3;4;120;10;Civilization, Exploration, Negotiation, Prehistoric
4395;Bean Trader;"The players take the roles of bean traders and are members of the famous Bohn Hanse, the union of northern European cities and merchants involved in the bean trade of the middle ages. The players travel from Hanse city to Hanse city in wagons filled with valuable beans, where they can deliver bean orders and buy more beans. When a player is in a city and has an order card and the necessary beans to fulfill the order, he may deliver the beans and collect the value of the order from the bank. When two or more players are together in a city, they may trade beans among themselves. Trading beans is important as it allows players to get rid of unwanted beans and acquire needed beans. In addition, a player will buy beans in the city, if it has the type he wants. From time to time, the bean supplies will be replenished as described on new harvest cards. After eight new harvests, the game begins its last round. After this last round, the game ends and the player with the most thalers (money) is the winner.&#10;&#10;Bohn Hansa (Bean Trader) is part of the Bohnanza family of games.&#10;&#10;";2002;5.79781;2.1852;3;5;90;12;Medieval, Travel
4396;Odin's Ravens;"Each morning, Odin sends the ravens Hugin and Munin to race over the world of Midgard and report back what they have seen. The first to return wins Odin's favor, but any cunning corvid has a few tricks in store, and these are the two most brilliant birds in Middle Earth.&#10;&#10;In this two-player card game Odin's Ravens, two ravens race across separate tracks, the tracks comprising domino-style landscape cards that feature different types of land. Each player has their own deck of cards, which they use to match the land type in front of their raven in order to advance the raven toward the end of the flight path. Odin (Loki in Osprey Edition) cards allow a player to take special actions, such as rearranging the track of landscape cards or impeding the other player's raven.&#10;&#10;In this first edition of Odin's Ravens, each player can create a personal auxiliary stack during play, playing cards from the hand now to set up plays in the future. The game lasts multiple rounds, with a round ending when a raven reaches the end of the flight path; that raven's player scores points equal to the distance separating the two ravens. There is also an Odin token that can slow down whichever raven it is in front of.  In addition, whoever has played more cards to the &quot;Magic Way&quot; during the round &ndash; a separate playing area in which players may play a particular type of card &ndash; wins three points. Once a player has accumulated twelve or more points, that player wins.&#10;&#10;The Odin's Ravens (Second Edition) transforms the game into a single race across a longer landscape, with players drawing a limited number of cards each turn from either the Loki deck or the land deck and playing as many cards as they desire.

Players must outfit their expedition and search through the most rugged terrain imaginable, while avoiding rattlesnakes, thirst, extreme heat, bandits, Apache guards, and other player's greed.

Find the treasure of Jacob Waltz, or die trying.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.04474;2.0;2;5;120;0;Adventure, Exploration, Industry / Manufacturing
4400;Overlords;"The W.H.A.T.: Overlords Fantasy Battlescape Wargame is billed as &quot;A Titan Variant&quot; by the publisher but is really a derivative game.&#10;&#10;Players assume the role of Overlords who must compete for world domination by recruiting armies of creatures and using them to wage war on the other players.  Build your army carefully, as you will need certain creatures to help you recruit other creatures.  Split your forces with care as your Overlords quests for new creatures to add to the army, as your opponents might slip past you and attack your Keep.  Unique pull-out Battlescape zones (like Titan's Battlelands) make the battle for each hex zone a uniquely different tactical confrontation.&#10;&#10;The map is closer to a traditional wargame map, showing a Divine-Right-like land divided in hexes.  The game comes with a 17&quot;x22&quot; full color mounted game board, 189 plastic playing tokens (to which 189 stickers must be applied!), 20 Overlords cards, 7 Pull-Out Terrain Battlescapes, dice and a rule book.&#10;&#10;There is also an introductory 2-player boxed set which can be used as an expansion of the main set (11&quot;x17&quot; full color map, 63 playing tokens, 10 Overlords cards, rule book and 5 Pull-Out Terrain Battlescapes), and four Creature Expansion Packs (each contains 21 playing tokens and 5 Overlords cards).&#10;&#10;";2002;3.17222;2.0;2;6;120;12;Fantasy, Wargame
4401;Canal Grande;"A card-game version of San Marco.

4403;Rumors: An Adult Conversation Game;"Rumors is an adult conversation game for three or more players. (though it can be played with two, via special rules)  The object of the game is to spread light-hearted rumors that lead to explanations about the life experiences and beliefs of the players.&#10;&#10;Players take turns spreading rumors about the other players. In response to each rumor, players must use knowledge, judgment, and intuition to guess whether there is any &quot;truth&quot; to the rumor.  Points are scored based on the players' abilities to guess correctly--and their willingness to select HOT rumors and elaborate on their responses.  The first player (or team) to score 40 points wins.&#10;&#10;";1997;3.0;0.0;2;6;30;18;Bluffing, Party Game
4404;Gold!;"Using the basic rules, the players start with $1,000,000 and 12 certificates representing financial instruments worth either 900,000, 1,000,000, or 1,100,000 and denominated in either dollars, pounds sterling, deutschemarks, yen, or swiss francs. They proceed around the board, encountering spaces that cause yields to change; prices to change; players to draw Risk or Option cards or roll on the Fate table; players to buy, sell, or swap investments; etc. The first player to reach the &quot;Gold!&quot; space gets an extra $1,000,000 and the game ends immediately; the wealthiest player at that point is the winner.&#10;&#10;The advanced rules add fluctuating certificate values and bank auctions of certificates. Playing time is a guess.&#10;&#10;The photo on the game cover is of an actual pile of a million pounds sterling worth of gold bullion.&#10;&#10;";1981;5.05;1.5714;2;8;60;10;Economic
4405;The Big Deal;"A game of quickly changing fortunes, where you try to climb the ladder of success by buying into wacky business opportunities (Rent-A-Monster, Kangaroo Airlines, Paint-On Socks, etc.) and hopefully selling them for a fortune.  (How little things have changed since...)&#10;&#10;Your net worth is kept track of using a slide rule of sorts, dubbed the &quot;ladder of success&quot;.  The first player to move into the Ritz by buying or winning steps on his ladder wins.  You can buy into up to four opportunities at once; when you land on another player's opportunity, you can attempt to &quot;bail him out&quot; of it by paying the bail out price and beating him on the dice.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Chance of a Lifetime&quot; circle is entered on doubles or by landing on an entry space; if you enter it, you may roll as often as you wish, hoping to land on the Big Deal space (which gives you 3 ladder steps) or another good space (where you sell your opportunities for varying profit).  Of course, the circle also includes bad spaces, so there is considerable risk...&#10;&#10;A few other spaces round out the board, giving you the opportunity to challenge other players (swapping a ladder step) and other things like that.&#10;&#10;The game is sort of a cross between Can't Stop and Monopoly.&#10;&#10;";1977;5.32143;1.2727;2;4;90;8;Economic
4406;Mini Archimedes;"This travel-sized version of the four-player Archimedes Professional is played on a 7x6 board.  The object is to capture the opponent's King by surrounding him with colored pegs.  The Kings are the black and white pegs and start on the Throne squares at either end of the board.  The other 30 pegs are multi-colored.&#10;&#10;On your move, you first move your King defensively, by sliding to an adjacent free space.  Next, you place a colored peg offensively, hoping to box the opponent King in.&#10;&#10;An optional rule allows a captured King to displace a colored peg if it happens to lie on a straight line away from him along with another same-color peg (at any distance).  Further, Kings aren't allowed to come adjacent to each other.&#10;&#10;";1983;5.33333;2.0;2;2;20;10;Abstract Strategy

There is no die, cards, etc. Men move one square at a time or jump over other men in order to reach the boat of the same color that is waiting at one of the 4 docks.&#10;What makes the game fun to play is the fact that every time a player gets a man into his boat, he changes the docking positions of all the boats by moving the boats clockwise to the next dock so that all players find themselves in new situations.&#10;&#10;Children learn the importance of waiting for the dock rather than running after it and keep MISSING THE BOAT!&#10;&#10;";1965;5.77692;1.0;2;4;10;10;Abstract Strategy, Action / Dexterity, Children's Game, Nautical
4408;Cyborg: The Ultimate Adventure;"&quot;Cyborg - The Ultimate Adventure&quot; is a two-player wargame with both SF and Fantasy elements (&quot;After the atomic wars, magic filled the land...&quot;). One player controls Princess Gloriana and her entourage, who are trying to get from the North East corner of the map to the Holy City in the South West, where Gloriana's coronation will take place. Gloriana is escorted by cyborgs, Amazons, and Imperial Guardsmen, and is watched over from afar by the magic-using Guardians in the Holy City. The other player controls Aemulatio, the sister of the dead king, who is trying to capture and sacrifice Gloriana in order to seize the throne herself. Aemulatio fields mutants, gargoyles, and a pair of Necromancers (amusingly named Kcud and Nootrac) against Gloriana's forces.&#10;&#10;Playing time is listed as &quot;2 - 3 hour(s)&quot; on the cover, but the rules declare there is no time limit. For Gloriana to win, she must reach the Holy City or totally rout Aemulatio's minions; for Aemulatio to win, her forces need only capture Gloriana (even if Aemulatio and her Necromancers are all dead, which would be a very Pyrrhic victory).&#10;&#10;A six-sided die (not included) is required to resolve combat, and also to allow the Necromancers to cast one spell with random effects once per turn, and the Guardians to cast one spell each of &quot;Mind and Magic&quot; per turn.&#10;&#10;The lurid cover art by R. P. &quot;Dick&quot; Winther, seems intent on evoking both Silver Age comics and 1940s pulp magazine covers, but falls far short of Excalibre's self-proclaimed &quot;Beautiful graphics and detail.&quot; A gargoyle is seizing a terrified Gloriana by the thigh, and appears to be wrestling her atop a rock... but closer inspection of the lower left corner of the cover reveals a second, smaller gargoyle in flight, and the space between it and Gloriana is filled with ant-sized fighting men. Presumably the main figures are meant to be aloft, though you'd never know it to look at them, making this cover one of the best examples of the classically &quot;bad&quot; game art of the 1970s.&#10;&#10;";1978;5.33824;2.0;2;2;120;12;Fantasy, Science Fiction, Wargame

4410;Barn Buzzin' Goofy;"This is essentially a two-player version of Loopin' Louie, rethemed to take advantage of the Disney license. Some have reported taping bits from two Barn Buzzin' Goofy sets together to make a &quot;poor man's Louie,&quot; but according to others, there are subtle differences in the design (arm balance, paddle size, disc diameter, etc.) that weaken this edition.&#10;&#10;From the back of the box:&#10;Down on the farm, Mickey, Minnie, Donald, and Daisy are getting their crops ready to go to market. But watch out! Overhead, Goofy is trying to fly his plane. Every time Goofy swoops too low, he hits the pumpkins and watermelons, and makes them roll out of the trucks!

The evil player must kill all the heroes to win; for the good player to win, a hero must capture the talisman and escape from the citadel.&#10;&#10;Counters are provided for all citadel components and heroes, but miniatures can be used instead.

(The fairy tales don't talk about would-be rescuers having bloody fights over who gets to take the princess back to her castle, but oh well.)&#10;&#10;Playing time is a guess.&#10;&#10;For 2 to 6 players Ages 8 and up.&#10;&#10;";1977;4.43423;0.0;2;6;60;10;Adventure, Fantasy, Fighting

Another 8 cards are added to a common Play Pile. Players then take turns rolling a die to determine what type of clues can be given, starting the timer, selecting a card from their hand, and trying to get the other players to guess what is on that card as quickly as possible.&#10;&#10;The four types of clues that can be given to describe your cards are:&#10;&#10;    Cloodle - provide clues by drawing and doodling&#10;    Tongue-Tied - use alliteration to give as many clues as possible that start with a single letter&#10;    Soundstage - act out or provide sound effects for clues (but you can't use words!)&#10;    Tweener - give hints in the form &quot;It's bigger than blank but smaller than blank&quot;, using two objects that imply the answer&#10;&#10;&#10;After someone guesses the card in play, stop the timer and draw a new card from the Play Pile. The next player takes the die and repeats the same process, until either no cards are left or the available 15 minutes are gone.&#10;&#10;Players who are stuck on a particular card can choose to discard that card, but two new cards must then be added to the game instead - one card is placed directly in that player's hand, and a penalty card is added to the Play Pile.&#10;&#10;The game is won by all players if they can work together to guess all of the cards in play before the timer runs out.&#10;&#10;";2002;6.18198;1.2708;2;99;20;13;Card Game, Party Game, Real-time, Trivia, Word Game

4426;Adeptus Titanicus II;"Originally published in one of GW's magazines in June 2000, these are revised rules for using titans (combat mechs) in an &quot;Epic 40,000&quot; SF-miniatures battle. However, although they occasionally refer to the Epic 40K rules, this is only if you want to use the titans with infantry or tanks in combined armies. By themselves, these rules constitute a playable game pitting titans against titans (an &quot;Epic 40K Lite,&quot; if you will). The concepts and mechanisms will be familiar to anyone who has played any of GW's miniatures games.&#10;&#10;Victory points are gained by damaging and destroying enemy titans, as well as by meeting the objectives of the chosen scenario. The player with the most VPs when the battle is decided is the winner. Playing time is completely arbitrary and will depend on the base point costs of the armies and the scenario being played.&#10;&#10;The rules WERE available on GW's Web site as a free downloadable PDF. However, the PDF doesn't include the objective cards that were printed on the back of the magazine where the rules first appeared, so unless this is fixed, players who have only the PDF will be limited to basic straight-ahead attack scenarios.&#10;&#10;";2000;5.65952;2.0;2;2;120;0;Miniatures, Science Fiction, Wargame

Placed in the role of platoon, company, or battalion commander, the player is faced with a wide variety of offensive or defensive missions to be carried out in a built-up area. The player must manage such specialized units as sappers, snipers, spotters, flamethrowers, and military police.&#10;&#10;Very limited intelligence with respect to the location of Enemy forces is a key characteristic of the game system. You can name it &quot;double-blind&quot; due to the fact that you just manage your own troops on your own map while your opponent is managing his forces on his own map. The opponent's forces have to be detected and then be marked with &quot;known/unknown&quot;-markers on your own map.&#10;&#10;Twenty scenarios include historical conflicts ranging from 1956 to 1979, and hypothetical situations involving NATO, Soviet, Chinese, and irregular forces.&#10;&#10;A comprehensive guide to scenario design is included.&#10;&#10;[Note: The actual name of the game, as given in the rules, is &quot;Cityfight.&quot; People often call it &quot;City-Fight&quot; because the name had to be hyphenated on the front of the box cover, and is also hyphenated on the box sides and on the maps where there is no such imperative.]&#10;&#10;Firefight: Modern U.S. and Soviet Small Unit Tactics is a similar game utilizing the same base system but without the many complications introduced in Cityfight.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 20 seconds&#10;Hex: 55 feet / 16.67 meters&#10;Units: Individual Infantry &amp; Vehicles to Fireteams&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;Two identical 17 x 22&quot; four color mapsheets&#10;Five dual-side printed countersheets (1400 1/2&quot; counters - 567 combat &amp; 833 markers)&#10;Two 64-page Cityfight rulebook&#10;One 40-page Cityfight TO&amp;E, Charts &amp; Tables booklet&#10;One 8-page Charts &amp; Tables booklet&#10;Four 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Very Low&#10;Complexity Level: Variable&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2-100 hours&#10;&#10;";1979;6.7764;4.2727;2;3;360;12;Modern Warfare, Wargame

4450;The Road to Vicksburg: The Battle of Champion Hill;"The Battle of Champion Hill game uses the Blue &amp; Gray system.  It was included in the Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine Issue #103.&#10;&#10;The May 16, 1863 Battle of Champion Hill was the largest, bloodiest, and most significant action of Grant&rsquo;s Vicksburg Campaign. 32,000 advancing Union soldiers met 23,000 Confederates in a fierce struggle for a vital crossroads roughly halfway between Vicksburg and Jackson, Mississippi. The field was dominated by bald Champion Hill, from which Confederate artillery opened fire on the Union army at 9:45 A.M. The first Federal assault on the hill drove the Southerners back with bayonets and clubbed muskets. As the Union soldiers tried to reform and consolidate their gains, they were swept away by a counterattack led by John Bowen&rsquo;s Missourians and Arkansans. Ulysses S. Grant ordered more men towards the hill and Bowen&rsquo;s Confederates were themselves driven off, compelling a general retreat. Southern Brig. Gen. Lloyd Tilghman was killed while directing a desperate rearguard action that enabled most of the Confederate army to escape towards Vicksburg. The decisive Union victory at Champion Hill was instrumental in forcing the Confederates out of the open field and into a doomed position inside the walls of Vicksburg.&#10;&#10;Brief summary of rules:&#10;Stacking:&#10;&bull; Up to 2 units may stack, unless optional stacking rule is used, which allows 5 units in one hex, as long as only one is of brigade level or higher.&#10;&bull; Units in a stack must attack the same target.  If desired, one unit of the stack may be withheld from attacks.&#10;&#10;Zone Of Combat/Enemy Zone Of Combat:&#10;&bull; ZOC extends into all 6 adjacent hexes.  ZOCs do not extend across river/creek hexsides, except at a ford or bridge.  ZOC does extend across streams.&#10;&bull; Units entering EZOC must stop moving.&#10;&bull; No unit may voluntarily leave an EZOC except by combat results&#10;&#10;Combat Restrictions:&#10;&bull; Units may only attack or be attacked once per phase.&#10;&bull; Units may not split up their strength points to attack into separate adjacent hexes.&#10;&bull; Units may attack all adjacent units of a group if desired.&#10;&bull; Before rolling  the die, the attacker may choose to reduce the combat odds (e.g., use the 2:1 table when attacking at 3:1).&#10;&bull; Cavalry units attacked only by infantry may retreat 2 hexes before combat is resolved (opt.).  The attacking units may enter the cavalry unit&rsquo;s vacated hex, but they may not select an alternate target.&#10;&#10;Attacker Effectiveness (&ldquo;Ar&rdquo; results):&#10;&bull; Attackers forced to retreat are flipped to their ineffective side.  Attackers remain ineffective until a night turn.  (Retreating defenders remain effective.)&#10;&bull; Ineffective units may not attack, i.e., they may not enter EZOC.  Ineffective units that begin their side&rsquo;s combat phase in an EZOC must retreat.&#10;&#10;Retreats/Advances:&#10;&bull; Units may not retreat off the map or through EZOC.&#10;&bull; One unit of a stack may retreat one hex to make room for another unit retreating into its hex (displacement)&#10;&bull; Any unit that cannot retreat is eliminated.&#10;&bull; A unit that participates in an attack/defense resulting in a hex being cleared of enemy units (i.e., the enemy retreated or was eliminated) may advance into that hex.&#10;&bull; Artillery may not advance after combat.&#10;&#10;Artillery Range Fire:&#10;&bull; Artillery may attack units within 3 hexes.  It may only do so if there is no adjacent enemy target.&#10;&bull; Artillery ranged attacks must be made at odds &ge; 1:3.&#10;&bull; Artillery units may never suffer adverse combat results when engaging in ranged fire.&#10;&#10;Night:&#10;&bull; No combat phase.&#10;&bull; Units adjacent to enemies may not move.&#10;&bull; Units may move, but may not enter EZOC.&#10;&#10;";1985;5.79265;2.3636;2;2;60;12;American Civil War, Wargame

The only difference between STATIS PRO BASKETBALL and the real thing is that now YOU are the coach!&#10;&#10;YOU pick the starting line-ups, send in substitutes, and call the fast break and full-court press. YOU call the slowdown, take out players to rest for the final period...and much more!&#10;&#10;Every player in STATIS PRO BASKETBALL is statistically rated to display his real abilities in each of the following areas: Field Goal Shooting, Free Throw Shooting, Rebounding, Fouls, Foul Drawing, Blocking Shots, Stealing the Ball, Assists, Defense, and Stamina.&#10;&#10;Luck is a factor in every basketball game, and STATIS PRO BASKETBALL represents the effect of chance with a unique system of FAST ACTION CARDS that keep the game moving fast while at the same time allowing everything that takes place in a real game to occur.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Game Equipment:&#10;        Scorepad&#10;        Rules Folder&#10;        Mounted full-color Playing Board with Reference Charts &amp; Tables&#10;        Set of Fast Action Cards&#10;        Player Cards representing players of every pro team.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;";1972;7.08549;2.1316;1;2;90;12;Card Game, Sports
4454;Statis Pro Football;"Statis Pro Football is an in-depth, simulation-first football game that uses the AH Fast Action Card system. Individual players are rated for their ability to throw, catch, run, block, rush the passer, etc. Players are the coach for their team, and choose from a selection of offensive or defensive moves (Inside Run, Short Pass or Blitz, Run No Key as examples) which affect the outcome, and then flip a deck of cards to work out the result. So if I call the right pass defense against your pass, it becomes harder to complete the pass, or a Run defense means your Run gets less yardage. But if I get it wrong, my defense may have no effect or even greatly increase your chances.  The game rules also cover kickoffs, punts, turnovers, penalties, etc.&#10;&#10;The basic game comes with stats cards for every player in every team. Avalon Hill produced several years worth of cards for use with the game, which you could buy separately. A strong team will usually overwhelm a weaker team, though good playcalling and some luck with the cards can mitigate that advantage. But by picking evenly-matched teams, it does require some forethought to work your team to a score. The game includes optional endurance rules, which mean that some players must 'rest' before you can re-direct a play to them. This means cycling players and dealing with injuries makes tricky decisions for the players.&#10;&#10;";1973;6.63147;2.55;1;2;120;12;Sports

4460;Green Ghost;"Marketed as the first glow-in-the-dark game, there were at least three versions of the board. One was green with red spaces, another white with red spaces and the third was white with brown spaces. The glowing does not work as well as showed on the television commercials, which, if you watched carefully, were filmed using black light. (If you wish to play the game, you may like to use a black light yourself.)&#10;&#10;Past the appearance, the game itself is pretty much the usual roll-and-move with a few twists. The board is up on stilts and the &quot;path&quot; has holes in it so that movers may fall through and thereby gain the privilege of opening one of the three pits (cardboard boxes containing ghoulish feeling items) and retrieving one of the precious small green ghosts. Players are not ensuring victory, but simply improving their chances in the end game which is decided by the giant green ghost spinner.&#10;&#10;Originally published by Transogram; revived 1997 by Marx Toys.&#10;&#10;";1965;5.22092;1.0;2;4;30;0;Children's Game, Horror

4470;Xanth;"Based on the fantasy Xanth novels by Piers Anthony.&#10;&#10;From the box: On Xanth... Anyone who doesn't believe in magic must reckon with the rainbow, which shows up only at a distance and retreats if anyone walks toward it. If one person stands still and another walks, the rainbow remains in place for the one and retreats for the other - simultaneously. It is one-sided, like a one-way path, invisible from the other side. That is obviously magic. - Piers Anthony&#10;&#10;Xanth, the magical, pun-filled world of Piers Anthony's fantasy novels, comes to life in this hilarious game. As one of many colorful characters, players must travel across land and sea in order to fulfill their wild and wacky quests. For 1 to 6 players, ages 12 to adult.&#10;&#10;Contents: 162 playing cards, 15 dice, 6 pawns, 12 chits, gameboard, rulebook, sorting tray.&#10;&#10;There are 3 card types used in the game, Chair Actors (Characters), Events/Encounters &amp; Quests. The majority are E/E cards. Only Character cards have colour illustrations, the others being monochrome or text only. A small errata sheet is included.&#10;&#10;Simple &amp; Easy Game&#10;Each player starts with 2 character cards and a Quest card (which determines their starting area on the map), with the character's Cunning &amp; Strength, plus a Talent - an extra rule or exception they can use, tying in to the character in the novels. &#10;Each turn starts by drawing an Event/Encounter card, playing it if it's a Disaster. Other E/E cards include objects to assist in some way, commonly in combat, hazards to play on other players, additional characters (mixed in from those not in play) etc., often limited by area (you have to get to some areas to activate some objects, for instance). &#10;If there is no Disaster, players move their pawn across the board (normally 2 areas, Characters, Event cards &amp; the area characteristics can modify this). The other players may then play Events or Creatures on them, possibly limited by the area. Characters can attempt to avoid encounters (roll dice under Cunning), or may fight (roll a die under Strength to cause a wound, repeat until one side loses). The specific encounter or creature may modify this, as can many E/E cards. &#10;Players start from scratch if their character is beaten, but can heal by use of certain cards or in certain areas. &#10;The first to complete their Quest wins.&#10;&#10;Still Simple &amp; Easy but Longer Game&#10;Same as before, but complete 2 or 3 Quests. This ties in to the 3 Quests set by the Magician Humphrey in the novels.&#10;&#10;Monaural (Solo) Game&#10;Same again, but work through the Quests deck until you are knocked out. hazards are drawn randomly instead of played by other players.&#10;&#10;Stereo (2-player) Game&#10;Same as the Monaural Game, the winner is the player who completes most Quests&#10;&#10;";1991;5.05363;1.6;1;6;180;12;Exploration, Fantasy, Humor, Novel-based
4471;Fist of Dragonstones;"Fist of Dragonstones is a closed-fist, bidding game. Players try to outwit their opponents by using gold and magic coins to buy control of an ever-changing cast of enchanted character cards. Those characters' powers collect valuable Dragonstones; lend their magical powers; help foil other players, and convert Dragonstones into victory.&#10;For each character card, players choose the number of coins they want to bid by placing them in a closed fist. All players reveal their bets at the same time with the winner of the auction then gaining control of the card's powers. Depending on the card they may: win additional coins or Dragonstones; place spells on other players; or win scoring points.&#10;&#10;The Legend : &#10;Many, many years ago, an enchanted forest lay hidden between two great mountain ranges. The forest valley was home to several kingdoms whose rival princes battled with each other to unite the entire realm under one flag. To gain advantage, princes vied with each other to collect powerful magic amulets called Dragonstones.&#10;Like many royals, over time the princes began to prefer the comfort and safety of their fortified castles. Rather than risk their own lives by venturing out to search for these amulets, they paid handsome rewards to those who could bring them stones. The allure of the princes' wealth soon filled the enchanted forest with all manner of wizards, witches, dwarves, goblins, and many other enchanted creatures - all in pursuit of the magic Dragonstones.&#10;&#10;This enchanted land is now almost entirely lost to legend. Yet, at a cozy inn, in a small forgotten village, the memory of Dragonstones is kept alive by the inn's ancient proprietor. Even today, a nod from a knowing traveler may persuade him to recount some of the ancient tales. And if he takes a particular liking to you, he may bring out his own collection of magic stones, and challenge you to a simple game of luck and skill and a chance to grab your own Dragonstones!&#10;&#10;";2002;6.15985;1.8596;3;6;60;8;Bluffing, Fantasy, Medieval

You can play any sets of the number rolled (two or more cards of that value), or any runs (three or more same color cards that follow each other in sequence) that end or begin with the number rolled (counting the dice as an extra card).  Finally you discard.  You can also freely increase played sets and runs on your turn.  First player to go out scores the total value remaining in the other players' hands.&#10;&#10;Dice Deck is similar to the Deck of Dice&#10;&#10;";1987;7.5;1.0;1;8;30;6;Card Game, Dice, Game System

4476;Hot Potato;"A high-pressure game of getting rid of a &quot;hot&quot; potato so as not to be holding it when time runs out.&#10;&#10;This game probably goes way back. Sidney Addy's Glossary of Sheffield Words describes a game in which &quot;a number of people sit in a row, or in chairs round a parlor. A lighted taper is handed to the first, who says:&#10;&#10;Jack's alive, and likely to live&#10;If he dies in your hand, you've a forfeit to give.&#10;&#10;The one in whose hand the light expires has to pay the forfeit.&quot;&#10;&#10;That was written in 1888.&#10;&#10;Apparently later it was played with an actual hot potato. Whoever ended up with the potato when the music stopped was kicked out and the potato elimination match continued.&#10;&#10;By the 1950s, manufactured Hot Potato games were already on store shelves. Remco&rsquo;s late 1950s version used small plastic pans for each player, covered up so that no one would know who was holding the real potato. In the 1960s, there was &ldquo;Spudsie,&rdquo; a wind-up potato who emitted a loud DING when time was up. In the 1980s, there was the battery-powered &ldquo;Chip O&rsquo;Grattin.&rdquo; Most recently there is a battery-powered talking potato, which shouts out &ldquo;Yahoo!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;";1988;4.38684;1.0;2;6;10;4;Action / Dexterity, Children's Game, Party Game, Real-time

As more and more trains leave the switching yard, the closer you get to the end of the game.&#10;&#10;";2002;5.16885;1.2632;2;4;30;8;Card Game, Economic, Trains
4479;Ratrace;"Known in French as &quot;Le fortuniste&quot;, Ratrace is all about social success. You start out in life with $200, a Credit Card and a Business in the Working Class (outer ring of the board) and your objective is to get into the Middle Class and eventually High Society (inner ring). You'll have to face the usual: running your business, paying taxes, getting an education, joining social clubs and much more. You win by retiring with $100 000.&#10;&#10;With six players, all businesses in the game start owned; with less players, the Treasury owns the remaining businesses. When playing with two or three, each player can own two sets of businesses at start. The businesses sell various Status Symbols (required to move up in society) in addition to &quot;Other Purchases&quot;. Credit can be used to buy things --the cards have no limit, but whenever you land on a Credit Due square you must pay the card off entirely, plus 10% interest. Bankruptcy means you start all over again.&#10;&#10;You can win up to 3 different status symbols at a time, and you cannot buy one of a class lower than your own. Money comes in through a payoff/salary square on each class ring (and a few other windfall squares), and changes hands with purchases in a zero-sum fashion.&#10;&#10;To enter the Middle Class, you must have $500, three status symbols and either a Night School diploma or a Country Club membership. Or you can marry. Status symbols now beneath you must be auctioned off. High Society requires $3000, 3 status symbols, and either a University diploma or a Yacht Club membership. Or marry again. The risk with marriage is that you may end up on a Divorce square...&#10;&#10;From a Waddington ad dated 1976:  &quot;A macho game of Social Climbing - Do you have what it takes to be a success? Start with $200 in the working class. Then try to make it to the Middle Class and High Society. You'll have to face all of life's anxiety's along the way, but there is always the chance of making it rich! Get in the Ratrace! You'll bite and claw your way to the top. You'll never know when you might need the skills this game will teach you  -  in real life!&quot;&#10;&#10;";1967;5.80193;1.5556;2;6;90;9;Economic

4482;Winchester;"Winchester is a race game where the players score points by getting their pawns around a rectangular track the fastest. Each player gets 3 to 5 pawns (based on the number of players) which are placed on a 4 by 4 starting grid.  The track is four squares wide. During the setup, the players randomly cover some of these squares with wooden blocks to provide obstacles that prevent movement. The location of the blocks is determined by several die rolls.  This random setup provides for a different track each race.&#10;&#10;Movement of the players' pawns is controlled by a special six sided chess die. The die contains the six basic chess pieces: King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight and Pawn. Each turn a player will roll the chess die to determine everyone's move for that turn.  Once all players have moved, the next player on the left rolls the die for the next round. When moving, the player must move one of his pieces based on the indicated chess piece.  Like chess, the player may not move off the edge of the board or over one of the obstacles, except for the knight move.  If the player captures one of the piece of another player, the two pieces exchange positions.&#10;&#10;The first piece to cross the finish line scores 15 points with each successive piece scoring one less (14, 13, 12, etc).  There are small bonuses for certain finishing conditions (first to have all pieces finish, three positions in a row, etc).&#10;&#10;The game comes with a rolled up, laminated board, 25 pawns, 24 wooden blocks for obstacles, one normal die and one chess die.&#10;&#10;";1990;6.19167;0.0;2;5;60;8;Racing
4483;The Buntu Circus;"The Buntu Circus was independently published by a group of UK gamers calling themselves The Buntu Circus. It is an abstract strategy game for 2 to 4 players. The board is divided into a 14 x 14 grid. Each square has a combination of one of eight colours and one of twelve symbols, arranged in a symmetrical pattern on the board.&#10;&#10;A deck of cards has one card per square on the board, matching colour and symbol. Each player gets a hand of eight cards and a set of counters and rubber hoops in their own colour. These are metallic colours, distinct from the board colours.&#10;&#10;In turn each player draws and then plays a card from their hand, placing or removing a counter on one of the appropriate squares on the board - each colour and symbol combination appears in two places on the board, and has two cards which can match.&#10;&#10;The idea is to get a number of linked rows of five counters in your colour, orthogonally and/or diagonally. The target number of rows depends on the number of players - five in a two player game and less if there are more players. Once a row has been formed, it is designated by placing hoops over each of the counters in the row.&#10;&#10;There are couple of further wrinkles. Most importantly are the &quot;power&quot; colours. At the start, each player has power in a single board colour, determined randomly. This allows the player to use a card of that colour to move an counter on the board (their own or another player's) either to an adjacent square of that colour or from a square of that colour to an adjacent square. Creating a row of five gains the player power over the colour of the middle square of the row - this is marked by removing the central counter from its hoop and placing it on one of the power colour markers to the side of the board. In this way players gain power over new colours. If another player already has power in that colour, their power is removed - but the player who gained power merely displaces them - they do not gain power in the colour. Gaining power over a colour in which you already have power reinforces power in the colour. The player &quot;hoops&quot; the power counter and this prevents any other player from gaining a row that would give them power in that colour. In effect they have a &quot;lock&quot; on that colour. A final wrinkle comes with the discard piles. Played cards can be discard to one of four face-up piles. Once one of the four &quot;draw&quot; decks is exhausted, the adjacent discard pile is turned over - but not shuffled. This allows long-term strategies of &quot;stacking&quot; the deck with particular colours or symbols.&#10;&#10;The quality of the components is superb. The board is big and colourful, the symbols clear and distinct. The player's counters are chunky plastic discs which come in little cannisters like pill-boxes. The hoops are rubber-like rings which come in individual cloth bags. Very satisfying to &quot;hoop&quot; your rows with.&#10;&#10;";1997;5.63636;3.6667;2;4;90;0;Abstract Strategy
4484;Maremba;"&laquo;A tactical game of skill and strategy&raquo;&#10;&#10;The board is 10x10 (1 inch squares), with the inner 4x4 squares replaced by a 10x10 grid of smaller squares.  The whole thing is in the middle of an octagon, with the edges used for storage of the 80 colored pegs.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with ten pegs of a color.  Each player places a peg in turn in the inner grid.  You are eliminated if: a) you have two pegs (of your color) in the same row, column or diagonal; b) you take more than a minute to place a peg; or c) you seek help from a non-player!  Once the inner grid is complete, play continues/repeats with the outer grid (you remove a peg from the inner grid and place it in the outer).&#10;&#10;Optionally, the last player can try to finish placing all 80 pegs whilst respecting the exclusion rule.&#10;&#10;Note that the outer grid is actually harder to solve because of the 4x4 hole in its middle.&#10;&#10;";1985;3.0;0.0;2;8;45;0;Abstract Strategy, Puzzle

4487;Silk Road;"A game of trading on the Silk Road. Each player is a merchant who travels from city to city buying and selling ten different goods in an effort to turn their starting 20 units of money into 10,000.&#10;&#10;The map is divided into nine regions each of which has a &quot;price index&quot; which is tracked on a erasable tile. Each merchant has a sliding paper device which lets them easily look up the current price of each good for a given price index. After buying goods in a region the region's price index changes, which may have unexpected effects; each good will push the index up or down depending on which direction increases the price for that good, but all purchase effects in a region are added together to produce the final effect. And, since the index determines the prices for all goods, buying one good can cause the prices of all ten goods to change. Selling goods has the same effect, applied in the opposite direction.&#10;&#10;The game represents the limited communication of the era by only letting players see the price index for the region they are in (and then only when in a city). Players cannot sell goods in the same region they bought them in for two turns, so information inevitably gets stale. Players can sell or trade each other information as well as goods.&#10;&#10;In addition to goods players can purchase animals, rent ships, and hire armies and guides. Animals let the player move faster and carry more goods; ships naturally allow sea movement and can carry an unlimited number of goods. Armies protect against bandit/pirate attacks, which are one of the types of random events rolled for every turn. Other random events can include war (guides help you avoid wars), epidemics, and getting married; marriage gives the merchant a family which does nothing useful, but you can sell goods for more money in your in-law's city. Some events can also change the price indices.&#10;&#10;";1985;0.0;0.0;2;8;45;10;Economic, Medieval

4494;Phase Line Smash;"A solitaire game based on the Gulf War. While the Iraqi unit's reactions are programmed, it is still possible to lose by taking careless chances that cause an excessive amount of friendly casualties.

The difficulty of the game adds to its play and replay value.&#10;&#10;Phase Line Smash handles a number of aspects of the Gulf War in a realistic and sensitive manner. Fratricide is one such issue that is included in the game mechanics and discussed in the historical notes included with the game.&#10;&#10;The game box is rather heavy because of the historical notes included with the game.

4502;König der Maulwürfel;"The inhabitants of the planet ROLLEX in the Sun system SOLLEX used to live on nothing but the delicious fried dice that fell from the sky. They found these so delicious, that they would often spend years at a time, just sitting in their towers, hardly moving at all, enjoying this delicacy.  Now and then, they would ascend to the top of their towers, and, just for the fun of it, would spit out dice in all directions out over the surrounding lands. As a result, it wasn&rsquo;t long before they were known far and wide as the Dicemouths.&#10;&#10;However, one day the rain of fried dice dried up, and the Dicemouths got extremely hungry.  But they remembered all the dice that they&rsquo;d spat out in the older, better, times.  Looking around, they found that many of them had developed into full grown dice trees, covered in fresh ripe fried dice.  But when the dicemouths tried to leave their towers to pick the dice, they found that they&rsquo;d got so fat that they couldn&rsquo;t get out through the doors.  They were trapped in their own towers.&#10;&#10;But just before it was too late, one of the dicemouths, who&rsquo;d saved a few dice in his tower, had a brilliant idea.  He spat out a die, just as they had always done, but this time, as the die shot out from the tower, he kept tight hold of it, and he and his tower were dragged along behind the flying die.  In this way, he managed to reach the dice trees, picked their fruit, and passed them on to all his friends, saving the race of dicemouths.&#10;&#10;Soon, all the dicemouths were able to travel this way.

The takers' goal is to make a certain amount of points in order to fulfill the contract which the taker player bids on at the beginning of the game. The goal of the other players (called the defense) is to stop the taker from achieving their score. The defense plays as a team against the taker.&#10;&#10;After receiving their hand, the players will take turns betting on a contract based on whether they think they can achieve the number of points required.

A note on the rules for&#10;     Nucraft&#039;s game Crash game indicate that Parker Brothers bought&#10;     the rights to the Lindy game from Nucraft.

GDW released a 2nd edition with minor changes in 1988, with a scenario book &quot;To the Sound of the Guns&quot; the same year.

4516;Ragnarok: The Twilight of the Gods;"Ragnarok: The Twilight of the Gods is a game depicting the struggle of the Aesir race of Norse gods against an invasion of enemies led by the traitorous god, Loki. The map depicts the Plain of Vigrid, lying between the Rainbow Bridge and the city of the gods, Asgard, where the battle takes place, and the playing pieces represent warriors, Valkyries, Frost Giants, Fire Giants, and such celebrated individuals as Odin, Thor, Loki, and the Midgard Serpent. Each player maneuvers his forces across the map in an effort to fulfill his victory conditions.

4518;Sauerbaum;"Award-winning cooperative boardgame that was published more than a decade before Knizia's The Lord of the Rings, Sauerbaum is a dice-based movement game. The board depicts a tree filled with a square grid of movement spaces, which are gradually filled from the top with tokens representing acid rain. The players' pawns try to move through the remaining open spaces on the tree, ending their movements on a raindrop, &quot;flicking&quot; it off. Thus, it's a race between the accumulating raindrops and the players' collective ability to flick them off with clever movement plays.&#10;&#10;The rules encourage the players to discuss the options openly for each player's turn, and in fact they'll have their hands full defeating the acid rain together. Doing it alone is practically doomed to failure, and will cripple the other players, too. The level of difficulty is easily adjusted by varying the number of acid raindrops that fall onto the tree.&#10;&#10;";1986;6.00114;1.6;3;7;30;8;Dice, Environmental

If the spinner points to one of the eight ladybugs, the player may move that ladybug to visit the others. Each ladybug piece has a magnet in its nose, and if the visiting ladybug &quot;likes&quot; the ladybug (i.e., is attracted to it), they may swap spots (each ladybug has five spots of one color), and she continues on to visit other ladybugs; if the ladybugs do not like each other, the turn is over. Once a ladybug has five spots of different colors, she is ready for the ball and taken out of play. The players win if all of the ladybugs are ready.&#10;&#10;If the spinner points to one of the smaller leaves, then the player doesn't get to move any ladybugs, but instead must advance the ants along the side of the board.

Trolls and Dwarves have different ways of moving and capturing. Each battle is ended by mutual agreement and then scored. When the first battle is over, the players switch sides. The combined scores from both battles determines the winner.&#10;&#10;Thud! is similar to Hnefatafl but is not actually a member of the tafl family (See http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/4049/tafl) because the manner of capture has been modernized and the game involves no king piece.&#10;&#10;";2002;6.26299;2.5854;2;2;60;8;Abstract Strategy, Fantasy, Novel-based

4545;Upper Hand;"This is a simple but challenging game. It is very simple to learn but the strategy can be very deep. The board consists of a 5x5 grid of dimples in which marbles are placed. The game is played somewhat differently than Pylos or Pyraos which form a pyramid on a 4x4 grid.&#10;&#10;The &quot;wild&quot; third colored marble is placed first in the center of the 5x5 grid. This overcomes the problem that the pyramid on a 5x5 base requires an odd number of marbles to build.&#10;&#10;In Pyramids the goal is to get rid of all of your playing pieces first. If placing a marble completes a square and at least three of the marbles in that square are the player&rsquo;s color, then the player gets to place an additional marble on top of the square. If the additional marble completes another square, then using the same rule as before the player gets to place a third marble on so on.&#10;&#10;Since the two players may have overall played a different number of marbles towards the end of the game, the game might be over before the pyramid is finished.

4550;1000 Blank White Cards;"1000 Blank White Cards is a public domain card game, which allows the players to make the cards during the course of the game. There are no initial rules, and while there may be conventions among certain groups of players, it is in the spirit of the game to spite and denounce these conventions, as well as to adhere to them religiously.&#10;&#10;Card Content&#10;&#10;Cards may feature a title, a picture, a score, a rule, or any other content, and need not be limited to one side or even to a single card. Early iterations of the game included cards with attached objects, and cards of a variety of sizes and shapes within the same deck and gameplay session. Many cards in later decks have a point value, but this is by no means a requirement.&#10;&#10;Cards generally include hand-drawn pictures. The game encourages quick sketches by non-artists, which can add to the overall ironic orientation of the game. Card illustrations can represent anything the designer wants to feature, from serious to absurd. (However, usually cards tend toward the latter.)&#10;&#10;Game Play&#10;&#10;Game play conventionally follows a &quot;draw one, play one&quot; rule, with standard rotation; however, this, as with any game parameters, can be arbitrarily altered in play.&#10;&#10;In one variant, blank cards are simply made available to all players at all times, and can be created without limitation and played in turn. In other variants, players seed an otherwise blank deck with their own invented cards, which are shuffled in with blank cards to form a deck of about 60-90 cards. In this latter variant, a player may only craft a new card if he or she draws one of the blank cards during the course of play.&#10;&#10;In most cases, unless countermanded or constrained by rules created during gameplay, players may play a card on themselves, on another player, or on all players. Card rules and actions may counter other cards which have already been played.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the deck is exhausted. Points may be tabulated and a winner declared. In some variants, players may then lay out all of the cards face-up for the &quot;epilogue&quot;, which allows players to choose the best cards to seed the deck for the next game. In other variants, all cards must be retained and reintroduced, regardless of perceived quality.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    Dvorak&#10;    Nomic&#10;&#10;&#10;";1996;6.7191;1.3797;3;99;60;5;Card Game, Comic Book / Strip, Humor, Party Game

4554;Phalanx;"This chess-like variant is themed around the military formations used by the Ancient Greeks. Each player has 15 identical pieces that are set up on opposite sides of the board, which is comprised of an 8 x 8 playing field of squares that is further divided diagonally in alternate fashion (see picture). Pieces are comprised of: 8 small triangles of various orientation (Auxiliaries), 4 squares (Archers), which are the size of two Auxiliaries, 2 Hoplites (which are the size of an Archer with a Auxiliary on top), and 1 Syntagma, a larger triangle (the size of 2 Auxiliaries combined). Since each piece must always be oriented to face it's owner (diagram for set-up is printed on the board), you'll find that some pieces are not interchangeable with others of the same type (like Hoplites and Auxiliaries). This is important as all movement is done by moving pieces diagonally, horizontally or vertically along paths that are not blocked and the piece must end on a space where the board outline matches his piece.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to capture or &quot;Phalanx&quot; your opponents pieces - not by jumping (Checkers) or by taking it's place on the board (Chess), but by surrounding it on two of it's sides with your pieces. A multiple Phalanx attack is possible if a move surrounds several of his opponents pieces with a single move. When 14 of a players 15 pieces are captured, that player can no longer win and is eliminated. Tied or games that are a draw (you can play to a time limit as well) are determined by the value of each players remaining pieces, which are from 5 - 20 points each.&#10;&#10;";1964;6.0127;2.3333;2;2;90;10;Abstract Strategy, Ancient, Wargame
4555;Das Blaue Amulett;"Das Blaue Amulett (The Blue Amulet) is a fairly simple boardgame in which the players take on the roles of princes trying to be the first to reach the Castle of Light to claim their inheritance.  During the journey players must play the right cards from their limited hand to avoid obstacles placed before them by their opponents.  Of course, having possession of the singular Blue Amulet allows a player to ignore many of these obstacles without needing the appropriate card.  Players can also maneuver their pawns (through the use of movement cards) in such a way as to bump their opponents onto a path going in the wrong direction.&#10;&#10;The board is beautifully illustrated and the game won the Spiel des Jahres award for Most Beautiful Game in 1986.&#10;&#10;Das Blaue Amulett is the second game in Noris' Fantasy trilogy, with Die Drei Magier and Der Feuersalamander being the first and third.&#10;&#10;";1986;5.68423;1.6667;2;4;60;10;Fantasy, Racing

4632;Die Monstermacher;"The players must try to stitch together a monster and revive it. You collect body parts from graves, the gallows and from other players warehouses.&#10;&#10;There is a nice rule controlling when you can steal from other players. You have a die that moves up or down one number when you perform certain actions. Others can steal from you when the amount of body parts in your warehouse exceeds or is equal to your die number. This balances things out and keeps the players stitching their monster together (using their cards) to keep their warehouses (card supply) from being raided.&#10;&#10;Art may be too gruesome for the youngest players.&#10;&#10;";2002;5.35714;2.0;3;5;45;16;Card Game, Horror
4633;Stop;"Stop is a variation of Uno, with players trying to empty their hand of cards by playing onto a discard pile by matching the color or number of the card on top of the pile. Stop also includes a few special cards and rules to tweak the gameplay and differentiate it:&#10;&#10;&#10;     6s and 9s are considered to be identical, so a 6 can be played on a 9 regardless of the color and vice versa.&#10;     If a player has a number card identical in color to the top card, she may play it out of turn onto the discard stack.&#10;     An exchange card allows the player playing it to have everyone give their cards to their left- or right-hand neighbor.&#10;     The +X card forces the next player to draw the top card of the deck and add it to her hand. If it's a number card, she must also draw that many cards.&#10;     The +2 card forces the next player to draw two cards and skip her turn &ndash; unless she also plays a +2 in which case the next player must draw four cards, etc.&#10;     A skip card skips the next player.&#10;     A stop card, which is numbered 0, can prevent the action of an exchange, +X, +2 or skip card played by the previous player.&#10;&#10;&#10;When a player runs out of cards, the other players score points based on the cards they still have in hand. After multiple rounds, the game ends if a player has 500 or more points; the player with the fewest points wins!&#10;&#10;";2001;4.83056;1.8;2;10;30;6;Card Game
4634;Warhammer Warriors: Kal Jerico;"A Warhammer version of Lost Worlds based on Games Workshop's 40,000 setting. Each player uses a battle book and chooses a page number for a maneuver for their turn. These are revealed simultaneously and cross-referenced. A chart then shows you which page to turn to see  the results of the maneuvers. Players usually end up wounded or in a better position to strike a killing blow.&#10;&#10;Warhammer Warriors is slightly more stream-lined than Lost Worlds and plays faster. Warhammer Warriors does not have &quot;behind you&quot; maneuvers and there is a lot more shooting/ranged combat. All characters have a Deathblow maneuver which speed up games if you're in a good position.&#10;&#10;Kal Jerico is number #1 in the series.&#10;&#10;";1999;4.75806;1.5;2;2;20;10;Book, Fighting, Science Fiction

4636;Clans;"In Clans, each player is trying to achieve victory by scoring as many points for their color as they can. This is tricky as each player's color is chosen at random and kept hidden until the end of the game. Each of the 12 regions of the board contains five areas, each area containing one of four different terrain types. Each area receives one hut each of five different colors. On their turn, a player moves all huts from one area containing less than seven to an adjacent occupied area, all the while trying to hide which color is theirs. After moving, if one or more areas are completely surrounded by empty areas, they are scored. If all colors are present in a scoring, any colors with only one hut present are removed. The epoch track allows a limited number of areas to score before the game ends, and each scoring can gain a bonus or score nothing depending on the terrain type in which scoring occurred and how far along the track the game has progressed; each scoring advances the track, and each section of the track gives different terrain types bonuses and penalties.&#10;&#10;Once at least twelve areas have scored the game ends, then players reveal their colors to find out who was best able to score the most points while keeping their color a secret.&#10;&#10;";2002;6.57724;2.0221;2;4;30;10;Abstract Strategy, Bluffing, Deduction, Prehistoric
4637;Max;"There are four animals in the game.  All the players are responsible for the bird, mouse, and chipmunk's safe journey to their home in a tree at the end of the gameboard path.  Unfortunately the tomcat &quot;Max&quot; is a natural hunter and chaser (he can't help himself) and is a continual threat.  The goal is for the players to work together to get the three animals to the safety of the tree.&#10;&#10;All the animals move based on the roll of two dice, each containing three black pips and three green pips.  A black pip moves Max one space, while green pips can be distributed by player consensus (teaches logic, consultation and decision making) among the other animals to move them.  Max moves more often and further than the other creatures who share the green pip rolls.  The players can opt to move their animals before or after Max; they may also use four cat treats to call Max back to the starting position, allowing the other animals to escape possible capture or lengthen their lead.&#10;&#10;Each animal has their own special short cut on the game board to speed their journey or dart from Max; if they end a turn on their shortcut start space, they may immediately move to the other end; if they overshoot the entrance, they miss it.  However if Max ends a turn on any short-cut entrance, he takes it immediately (but will not eat any animal on the shortcut start.  Max can end up between or even ahead of the other animals as they advance down the path together.  When Max reaches the base of the tree, he camps out and can't be returned to the start with a cat treat.  The other animals will have to risk a final leap on and off Max's back to get to safety.  The players all win or lose depending on how successful they are at saving the bird, mouse and chipmunk from Max.&#10;&#10;";1986;6.46038;1.1154;1;8;20;4;Animals, Children's Game, Racing

4642;Sports Illustrated Baseball;"Tabletop baseball simulation game.&#10;&#10;In 1971, Time Inc (owner of Sports Illustrated magazine) published their first baseball game, titled Sports Illustrated Major League Baseball.  It included 20 players on each at-that-time current (1970 season) baseball team, presented on tri-fold color charts.  The following two years, they released new editions to cover the most recent season.  For 1972, they switched to teams of 25 players each, on double-sided color charts without folds.  In 1973, The game title was changed to Pennant Race and the team roster size was reduced to 19 or 20 players per team. The team charts were replaced by individual player cards on perforated sheets, with no color coding.&#10;&#10;Also in 1972, Time released a set of 16 All-Time All-Star Team Charts (in the same style as that year's edition), for each of the original American League and National League franchises, each with the 25 &quot;best&quot; players from that team's long history. In 1973, the same All-Time charts were released in a separate All-Time All-Star Baseball game.  This product was popular among tabletop managers.&#10;&#10;The All-Time All-Star game was then changed to an individual card format and retitled as Superstar Baseball.  This was later transferred to The Avalon Hill Game Co when they picked up the entire line of sports games from Time.  This also granted The Avalon Hill Game Co the right to use the words &quot;A Sports Illustrated Game&quot; on any The Avalon Hill Game Co sports product, even if it wasn't part of the original Time, Inc line of games, which led to some confusion for titles such as Baseball Strategy, Football Strategy, and Pro Golf.&#10;&#10;Special dice with results ranging from 10 through 39 (often called 10-39 Dice, see How to make a set of SIBB dice -- A Tutorial) were required to play this game, and sister games in the original Sports Illustrated sports simulation line.&#10;&#10;";1972;7.30607;1.96;1;2;45;12;Dice, Sports

4645;Dragon Epic;"Dragon Epic is a strategy game of army maneuver and battle, with the added flavor of magic. Heroes go on quests to discover powerful artifacts. Dragons can fly across territories to raze and pillage. Mighty leaders send hordes of mercenaries and strange creatures into mortal combat.&#10;&#10;Troop types range from basic infantry, knights, mystic creatures, and heroes. Each troop card is placed in a battle line and casualties are removed from the front of the line unless they can be targeted with a special ability. So generally you want to place your toughest units in the front lines.&#10;&#10;Each card lists its strengths and weaknesses. The number of stars across the top represent the amount of damage it can take, followed by number of dice it  rolls in combat, offensive strength, and defensive strength. This seems simple, but the addition of creatures, special abilities, artifacts, and spells add to the strategy.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.68333;3.0;2;4;180;12;Adventure, Fantasy, Wargame

4650;Across the Board;"Players choose which of the four racetracks will be used for the game. Each player is handed a copy of the appropriate race form (which should be studied!). The eleven racehorses, which are numbered two through twelve, are randomized and are bought, one at a time, by the players in an open auction. Money spent in the auction will be brought back into the game during the third, fifth and eighth races.&#10;&#10;Eight races make a complete game and each follows the same procedure. Each player, in turn, has the option to make as many bets as one wants but each bet is made &ldquo;across the board.&rdquo; All bets are made in 150-skin (the game&rsquo;s monetary unit) increments: 50 to win, 50 to place and 50 to show. After everyone has placed their bets, the money is divided as equally as possible into seven stacks.&#10;&#10;After all bets have been placed, the race is run. A horse has completed a circuit of the track when five Xs have been placed next to it. Sometimes horses begin with some Xs and sometimes the favorites, horses 6, 7 and 8, need an extra X.&#10;When a player rolls the dice, that player may give the horse rolled an X and pass on the dice or give that horse a / (half-X) and roll again to that horse an X. When three horses have finished the race, the owner(s) of the winning horse and winning bettors are paid. The player with the most money at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;Across the Board features a pari-mutual betting system to mimic a real racetrack. There are no fixed odds. The winners win what the losers lost. That makes Across the Board unique among horse racing games.&#10;&#10;";1975;6.64791;1.8333;3;7;60;0;Animals, Dice, Racing, Sports
4651;Stalingrad;"The original edition came out in 1963 in a double-size box. The large box was nearly twice the area of a traditional AH box. Later the game came out in a traditional-size box.  A second edition with clarified rules was issued in 1974 with the same standard size box but thinner.&#10;&#10;The rules are fairly straightforward.  The strategies are extremely deep. Stalingrad is by far the most thoroughly and deeply analyzed board war game.  Furthermore, the game preserves interest for players at a wide range of levels. Stalingrad is a good game to use to introduce players to hex-based war games.&#10;&#10;Stalingrad uses a move-combat sequence, alternating between players.  There is limited advance  (one hex) or retreat (two hexes) after combat.  Units have one-hex thick zones of control; movement directly from one hex in the zone of control of a unit into an adjoining hex of the zone of control of the same unit is not allowed.  Functional terrain includes swamp (one hex per turn movement), mountains (one hex per turn movement, defenders are doubled), major cities (defenders doubled), rivers (defenders behind rivers are doubled if attacked only across the river), railroads (ten hex movement bonus, must be taken all at once), lakes (impassible).  Weather is good in summer, snow in winter, and governed by a table in the spring and fall.  Mud halves ground movement.  Snow halves ground and rail movement, and freezes (converts to clear terrain) some swamps, rivers, lakes, and oceans.  Combat is mandatory between units that are adjacent at the end of each turn, but the attacker chooses which units attack which other units, so long as all adjacent units are in some battle.  The classical Avalon Hill D6 table, with results such as D Elim, A Elim, etc is in use.  Germans have limited replacements; Russian replacement rates escalate as the game goes on.  The objective is to capture the opposition's key cities (for the Russians, Leningrad, Moscow, Stalingrad) or to destroy the other side's army.  The Russian (implicit in rules) can also win by taking Helsinki, Warsaw, and Bucharest, and holding them for two complete turns, but I have never heard of this being done between normal players.&#10;&#10;Several extremely bad German strategic plans are in wide use.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 2&#10;&#10;";1963;6.14922;2.2258;2;2;120;12;Wargame, World War II

4659;Moods;"In Moods, players take turns drawing a Mood Card and a Phrase Card. The active player reads the phrase aloud, embodying the emotion specified on their Mood Card&mdash;which remains hidden from the other players. The remaining players then use their voting chips to guess the mood being portrayed. Correct guesses allow both the actor and the guessers to advance on the game board. The first player to reach the finish space wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game emphasizes expressive reading and emotional interpretation. Players must convincingly convey moods such as &quot;romantic,&quot; &quot;sneaky,&quot; or &quot;zany,&quot; while others rely on their perception to identify the correct emotion.

4669;Harry Potter Dicers Game;"From the Warner Bros. website:&#10;&quot;Dicers is a collectible dice game with two levels of play. Knock your opponents dice out of play in the basic game, or develop unique combinations to expel dicers to the dungeon in the advanced game. For ages 5 years and over.&quot;&#10;&#10;The dicers game is played with collectible dice. These have 5 clear sides, with a figure representing the character inside of the dice. The sixth side is solid, and shows the name of the die, its &quot;casting number&quot;, its special ability, and its affiliations. The clear sides are numbered from 1 to 5, while the solid face is the '6'. Each die represents a character or item from the Harry Potter stories.&#10;&#10;The starter set includes 6 dice; Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Draco Malfoy, Severus Snape, Hagrid, and the Sorting Hat. It also includes a sheet of rules.&#10;The rules actually have 3 levels of play described in them. The basic game only uses the casting numbers on the dice. The Intermediate game adds in the abilities of the dice, and different areas of play, and the advanced game adds in the affiliations of the dice, and reserve abilities.&#10;&#10;In the basic game, players set out the six dice and each take turns picking one to determine which dice they will use. Players then roll to see who goes first (the &quot;Challenger&quot;).&#10;The challenger picks one die, and then the defender picks on of their dice.&#10;The challenger may roll the die a number of times up to its Casting number, looking for as high a roll as possible. Only the last roll made counts, even if it is lower than a previous roll.&#10;The defender does the same with his or her die.&#10;The lower roll is expelled (removed from play) and the winner becomes the new challenger. This is repeated until only one player has dice left.&#10;&#10;In the Intermediate game, there are three areas of play. All dice begin in the Field. A losing die is placed in the dungeon, where it cannot be used. A winning die is placed in the Keep. Dice in the keep cannot be used until a player has no dice left in the field, at which point all of the dice in that player's Keep are moved into the Field. The winning die can choose to either expel the losing die to the dungeon, or to just place it in the Keep and activate the special ability of the winning die. One side of the rules lists the different special abilities. A few examples include:&#10;Capture, which lets you take the enemy die and use its special powers as well as your own.&#10;Summon, which lets you retrieve a die that has been placed in the dungeon.&#10;Swap, which lets you trade the locations of two of a player's dice.&#10;The game ends when one player's dice are all in the dungeon or captured.&#10;&#10;In the Advanced game, you can use the affiliations on the dice. The affiliations include the four houses, creatures, and wizards. For every die with the same affiliation as your chosen die in your Field, your die gains +1 to its casting number. This level of the game also adds reserve abilities. These are special powers that, when activated, have no immediate effect but allow the die to be set aside in 'Reserve' and activated later.&#10;&#10;Extra dice are sold as single dice. The die you are buying is clearly displayed on the outside of the packaging.&#10;&#10;The packaging stated that there were &quot;54 characters to collect&quot; but only 36 were released.&#10;&#10;There were two 'Starter Packs' with 6 dice each and 24 individual dicers.&#10;&#10;";2002;4.30769;1.5;2;2;10;0;Children's Game, Collectible Components, Dice, Fantasy, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Novel-based
4670;Proclaim!;"Players take turns giving clues to their fellow participants. Clue givers try to construct one-word clues that will lead others to guess the Proclaim! word. There are up to 3 rounds for each word, and the earlier the round, the more points that are awarded to the clue givers and correct guessers. The more people that guess the correct Proclaim! word, the fewer points that are awarded to each person, so clues must be clever enough to lead players to different possible answers to maximize their score. Creative, tricky ambiguity is the key to the game. Both the clue giver and guessing players have additional opportunities for extra points. For example, if a guessing player is certain they know the Proclaim! word, they yell &ldquo;Proclaim!&rdquo;, and roll the dice to determine the number of points to move forward for a correct guess, or backward for an incorrect guess. Also, the clue giver earns a &quot;unique&quot; bonus if the guessing players each give a different answer.  Play continues until the first player has successfully advanced to the finish space on the Proclaim! board.&#10;&#10;";2002;6.63636;0.0;4;10;45;12;Bluffing, Party Game, Word Game

Grand Master Jean Parisot de la Valette (GM 1557-1568) had a force of 592 knights, to which several thousand arms-bearing men drawn from the Maltese population were also added. The Ottomans quickly defeated the Maltese militia, became master of the countryside and laid siege to the fortress, which was stubbornly defended by the Knights Hospitallers. After four months of siege, the knights, in a desperate fight over St. Elmo Fort and its natural harbor, inflicted heavy casualties (according to reports, 7,000 dead) on the Ottoman forces. Following the landing of 6,000 - 8,000 reinforcements from Sicily, the Knights again defeated the Ottomans, which embarked and left.&#10;&#10;";1986;5.97215;3.0;2;2;120;12;Renaissance, Wargame

The Pawns start at the bottom-most spaces on the board and try to move up to the large, central top-most space: THE PIEDESTAL.

4688;Angola;"(from MMP's webpage:)&#10;&#10;Angola recreates a brief portion of the violent, decades-long Angolan civil war that began in the 1970s with the fall of a colonial power and dragged its bloody way into the 21st century thanks in part to cold war politics.&#10;&#10;Angola is a multi-player game in which players control the various Soviet- and US-backed factions that vied for control of Angola from 1975 to 1976. Originally released in limited quantities by Ragnar Brothers of the UK, Angola quickly became a rare and highly sought after game of almost cult status. Why? Angola features a number of innovative game systems that keep players guessing, create plenty of tension, and reward the right balance of boldness and caution. MMP is now updating this classic with the fabulous graphics of the IGS line of games and bringing it to a wider audiences.&#10;&#10;The map is divided into areas, and units represent military formations and also special weapons, such as artillery, rockets, tanks, and airplanes. A unique command and activation system has players committing in secret to the order in which they will activate a limited number of their units for the turn. The players then take turns activating their units in the determined order. The result is like a tense game of poker, with players trying to analyze the map and out guess their enemies.&#10;&#10;The game is finely balanced, and all players frequently feel as if they are simultaneously on the verge of victory or defeat thanks to an ingenious victory point system that rewards good play for both sides and allows players to absorb reversals and strike back with the right countermove.&#10;&#10;Angola contains:&#10;    2 decks of cards (110 total)&#10;    32 page full-color rulebook&#10;    2 player aid cards&#10;    22&quot; by 34&quot; inch map &#10;    3 countersheets &#10;    4 six-sided dice&#10;&#10;Developer: Adam Starkweather&#10;&#10;";1988;8.03975;3.1633;2;4;480;0;Civil War, Modern Warfare, Wargame

4732;Space Warrior;"User Summary&#10;&#10;A simple tactical hex-and-counter game of small-scale boarding actions in space.&#10;&#10;The counters represent individual combatants (referred to as &quot;characters&quot; in the rules). There can be up to twenty boarding and twenty defending characters. Each character is individually rated in four categories: Wounds, Offensive Class, Armor, and Weapons. The value for each category will range from 0-2 based on points assigned by the controlling player (four points are allotted to each character).&#10;&#10;An optional rule allows for character advancement for every ten (!) missions a character survives (which seems like long odds in a game that is always a battle to the death). Other optional rules include written orders, facing, initiative determination for each unit, and a different allocation of character construction points for multi-player scenarios. Team play is offered as part of the scenario creation rules.&#10;&#10;Rulebook Excerpts&#10;&#10;You have received orders from Fleet Command to capture a ship and have jumped from your shuttle onto the landing bay of the enemy craft. The orders are repeated over the headset: &quot;Capture the ship intact; no prisoners are to be taken.&quot; You do not know the reason for the order nor do you care. As mission commander, your sole concern is the successful completion of your mission with as few casualties as possible.&#10;&#10;From your bunk you hear the klaxon blaring. Startled from sleep, you realize that your ship is under siege and listen for further orders. &quot;They must not leave the ship alive.&quot; There is no time for questions; you only know that you must kill the invaders before they kill you.&#10;&#10;Designers' Notes:&#10;&#10;After carefully reviewing the board, it should be obvious that SPACE WARRIOR is a game of movement. Be careful not to stray too far from the wall that can provide cover or a hatchway that can provide escape. We strongly recommend the use of the optional rules. These rules enlivened the game during play-testing at the expense of only a few minutes of additional playing time.&#10;&#10;";1980;4.9;0.0;2;4;60;12;Fighting, Science Fiction, Wargame

4760;Life of the Party: Murder in Paradise;"Milton Bradley produced 8 mystery party/role playing games (in the vein of How to Host a Murder) in 1987.  They were all called &quot;Life of the Party&quot; games, four mysteries and four murders.  The back of all boxes indicates that these are also copyright Jamie Swise Games, as that outfit produced several of their own titles (and several, if not all, of these) a few years earlier.

While it is not the most convenient time for you to take a trip, you felt compelled to honor the offer.&#10;&#10;On the third night of your stay, during the treasure hunt, two of the guests were murdered.  They were identical twins Joel and John Rogers.  The brothers were very wealthy traders of precious metals and two of the most disruptive and obnoxious people (once) alive.

4761;Life of the Party: Who Killed Roger Ellington?;"This is one of the Jamie Swise murder-mystery role-playing games published by Just Games. It was later published by Milton Bradley as part of their &quot;Life of the Party&quot; line beginning in 1987.&#10;&#10;Episode: Who Killed Roger Ellington?&#10;&#10;The Plot: Post-war America was thriving in 1948, as was murder in a small Massachusetts town. Industrialist Roger Ellington was cut-down in the prime of his sordid life. After eating a plate of snails, he succumbed to what appeared to be a most deadly strain of indigestion.&#10;&#10;The Time: Aug. 9, 1948&#10;&#10;The Place: Washington Station, Massachusetts&#10;&#10;The Cast:&#10;&#10;Major Deegan: Lifetime resident of Washington Station. Deegan was Roger's chief competitor for women, status &ndash; everything for as long as anyone could remember. A well-trained mercenary, Deegan returned to town shortly after the war, satisfied that he and a few others had saved theWestern world from evil. He couldn't remember where he was the night of Roger's death.&#10;&#10;Derrick Ellington: Stepbrother of the deceased, had been away in the Merchant Marines for ten years, returning to town a year ago. Derrick became engaged to Sara Admunson after his return. She died shortly after in an auto accident. A drunken Roger was driving her home from a party when he lost control of the car. Derrick crawled into a bottle shortly after the funeral and never came out. Always looked down upon by his brother, Derrick never &quot;lived up&quot; to the Ellington name. Perhaps that is why he sought refuge in the Merchant Marines for all those years. He couldn't remember where he was the evening of the murder.&#10;&#10;Cybil Admunson: Sister of the late Sara. It was common knowledge that Cybil loved Roger. A social climber, Cybil was not liked by many. At her sister's funeral she exchanged some pretty harsh words with Roger. While deciding on which college to attend next, she worked as hostess at L'Escargot. She was on duty that night.&#10;&#10;Arnold Green: Boston College student working at L'Escargot for the summer. Green was not a born waiter, and was publicly humiliated by Roger on several occasions. Green served that evening.&#10;&#10;Yvonne Drake: Master pastry chef at L'Escargot, she came from Paris shortly after the war. A cold &quot;foreigner&quot;, she did not mix easily with the locals. However, she was having a rather obvious affair with Steve Watson. Yvonne was in and out of the kitchen all evening.&#10;&#10;Steve Watson: Young, energetic man who come from Boston in 1946. Steve was well liked and was Roger's business partner in many deals. He was president of the local Chamber of Commerce. He dined with Roger and Gastonne that evening.&#10;&#10;Gastonne Schmidt: Owner and head chef of L'Escargot. Since his arrival from Paris a year and a half ago, Schmidt had become known as an arrogant yet likable eccentric. He gave the town a bit of European class, and his gruffness only added atmosphere to his establishment in the eyes of the townspeople. He dined with Roger that evening.&#10;&#10;Katie LaFemme: Local party girl with the proverbial heart of gold. Having had a painful on-again-off-again affair with Roger, Katie knew of his dark disposition. She once bellowed from her roost in Jerry's Bar, &quot;Someone ought to put him out of my misery!&quot; She also couldn't remember where she was that evening.&#10;&#10;Game Includes:&#10;Full Plot Scenario &#10;Character Biographies&#10;Recorded Introduction&#10;24 Clues &#10;Solution&#10;&#10;";1982;6.16667;1.5;8;8;180;18;Deduction, Murder / Mystery, Party Game

4765;As the World Turns;"&quot;As played by the Hughes family on the Television Show As The World Turns.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game mechanics are very similar to the &quot;shortened game&quot; version of Monopoly.  Players are dealt Passport and Travel cards at the beginning of the game and pay the Customs Fund (bank) the value of those cards.  Players then take turns moving their pawns around the board.  If they land on a city space, they pay the indicated amount to the owner(s) of the passport(s) for that city.  Landing on other types of spaces results in various actions like drawing a Customs card, spinning the world spinner, and moving off-course.&#10;&#10;The winner is the person with the most money when the game ends.  The game ends when a player completes both legs of the course and lands on the &quot;home&quot; space.  Triggering the end of the game is optional: if a player doesn't think he/she has enough money to win the game, they can pass the home space and continue along the second half of the course.&#10;&#10;";1966;5.83333;2.0;2;6;60;10;Adventure, Economic, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Travel

4767;Murder on the Orient Express;"This game takes place on the famous Orient Express. There are 12 spies on the train as well as the detectives Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson. The players take turns moving the detectives and the spies around the train and keeping track of their movements. Every 8 turns (8 hours in the game) they check their notes and determine which spies have been killed. A spy is killed if it is ever a) alone in a compartment or corridor square for 1 or more hours, b) a second spy enters the compartment or corridor square and c) the spy is never in the same compartment or square as one of the detectives afterwards. Since the status of a spy is not determined until turn 8 (or 16 or 24) it is possible to move a spy, which is already &quot;dead&quot;. This spy cannot kill other spies even if it fulfills the conditions above. Since the status of a spy depends entirely on their movement it is important for the players to keep careful notes and to be able to defend their logic to the other players.&#10;&#10;";1967;5.76923;0.0;2;6;0;10;Deduction, Murder / Mystery, Novel-based, Trains

The shooting success is ruled by the dice and a round rotating table that gives the exact minimum dice value (between 1 to 6) needed on a throw with the dice based on the distance (in hexes) between the shooting unit and the objective unit.

Each Location holds new challenges and requires strength, wisdom, endurance, or determination.&#10;&#10;The game proceeds over six rounds. Each round consists of two consecutive phases:  &#10;1. Movement phase: The Marker moves over a Path card. On the path to the individual locations, the players collect Character and Gandalf cards.&#10;2. Scoring phase: The Marker reaches a Location. Here, each player plays, all at once, as many cards face-up in front of himself as he wishes or he passes. After all players have done this, scoring occurs. Players compare the total number of their played cards. Only cards displaying the characteristic of the current Location card and Gandalf cards played in the column with the matching characteristic are counted. Whoever has the most cards of the appropriate type takes the highest point tile at that Location and the Ring (he is the start player for the next round). The player with second-most cards of the appropriate type takes the next highest point tile and so on - the player with the fewest matching cards gets nothing. &#10;The player who has earned the most points by the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;";2002;5.81723;1.9583;2;5;30;9;Card Game, Fantasy, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Novel-based

4784;Test Match;"Players play out a live-action cricket game with miniature figures on a fabric playing field. One player 'bowls' a small ball from a bowler while the other player operates the batsman. Fielders are placed throughout the board to 'catch' the ball in the base between their feet.&#10;&#10;A classic and beloved family game originally released in 1977 and immensely popular in the UK, Australia, India and South Africa in particular. The game has undergone a number of changes and additions over the years, but basically layout and game play has stayed the same.&#10;&#10;In some versions, the Bowler figure has a long tilting 'chute' that the ball rolls down after pushing on the bowlers arm. In others the figure is spring loaded and pressing a lever makes the figure 'throw' the ball, with a setting for fast or slow bowling. The balls themselves have changed from small metal ball bearings to two sizes/weights - for both variety in play and for easier game play for younger players.&#10;The Batsman figure in some editions has a string with which you pull back the bat to release it to hit the ball, others have a slide mechanism and some have a trigger mechanism to move the bat. &#10;The fielding player figures are a variety of colours in different versions and may be white, yellow or blue. Additionally in a couple of versions (like Super Cricket) they had magnetic bases to further help 'field' the ball.  &#10;The player figures in one version (One Day Cricket) came entirely unpainted and could be painted the colours of your favourite teams. Later editions include an actual Wicket Keeper figure rather than a 'W' shape part of the batter mechanism.&#10;&#10;The playing 'field' also has changed shape and fabric. In some editions it is very thin light fabric (and in older games, the flocking on the underside completely disintegrates and moults off!) in others it is thicker, crease resistant neoprene. The boundary 'fence' is either white L shaped angled plastic flat or picket shaped strips with green joiner pieces or in more recent versions, a simple rope length.&#10;&#10;In the different versions players can simulate a one-day international, a Twenty/20 series or a full five-day test match. &#10;As well as being featured on box graphics, some well known cricket players have even lent their names to some versions, like Freddie Truman, Mike Atherton, AB De Villiers &amp; Jonty Rhodes.&#10;&#10;It is very difficult to date many of the earlier games accurately as there are no dates on the boxes (very annoying). The date '1977' on the included rule sheet ACTUALLY refers to the copyright date of the ORIGINAL games release by Peter Pan Playthings and NOT that particular versions release. Guesstimates can be made by the box imagery, design and playing piece inclusions.&#10;&#10;&#10;World Cup Cricket is touted as &quot;The original action-packed table-top cricket game!&quot; for Ages 4 and up.&#10;In the box (decorated with action shots of late 80s / early 90s players including Alec Stewart and Jack Russell) comes with a green beize (?? beige) playing area which is laid out on a table, with six boundary fence sections which Velcro around the edge to act as the boundary and prevent the ball flying off around the room. The batsman attached at one end and the bowler to the other.&#10;&#10;The pitch (although octagonal) resembles an archery target -the closer to the boundary and further from the batsmen, the higher the ring value. Directly in front of the batsmen is an area worth no runs, outside of that 1 run, then a ring worth 2 runs and the outer area worth 3 runs. Hitting the fence gets 4 runs and there are four small areas jutting out of the boundary worth 6 runs.&#10;&#10;The bowling player places fielders (with a catching 'cup' between their legs) around the field in an attempt to 'catch' the batsman out. Bowling is achieved by loading the ball into the bowler's cupped hand and pushing down on the front arm, causing the ball to roll down a ramp towards the batsman.&#10;&#10;The batsman is controlled with cord attached to the bat. The batting player pulls back the cord, releasing it in time to hit the approaching ball. Whichever area the ball is hit to is the number of runs the player gets.&#10;Batsmen can be out by being caught by the bowler, by hitting the ball between the legs of the fielders into their 'cups', by the ball hitting the stumps behind the batsmen or by the batsman edging the ball into the &quot;wicket keeper&quot; which is attached to the batting stand.&#10;&#10;There are earlier versions of the game where the batting action is different and the players less detailed.&#10;&#10;";1977;6.16264;1.0;2;2;90;0;Action / Dexterity, Children's Game, Sports

Incriminating? Surely it will be a night to live on in the memories of all who live through it . . .&#10;Your Dinner Companions Include:&#10;P. Leigh Jerreyes is an RN by trade, and new to the world of writing. She is a budding author who has written her first book of poems entitled, &quot;Bedpans and Betadine.&quot; She's brought her manuscript with her, hoping to convince Mr. Wirst to publish it.

Her latest titles, The Letches of Lidgefield County and Lust Knows No Bounds, have sold well over twelve million copies worldwide.

He is as popular with members of the opposite sex as he is with his readers. Ray prefers clothes that display sports logos.&#10;&#10;Portia &quot;Por&quot; Rytere is a literary novelist whose mixed metaphors are often only understood by MENSA members, and whose analogies are so deep that one must reread her books many times to grasp the hidden meaning.

4791;Duplicate Ad-Lib Crossword Cubes;"Players roll their 13 letter cubes and then arrange them into words crossword style before the timer runs out.  Once time is up, players score their words.  They then close the lid to their box, gently shake it so that the words are mixed up but the letters remain the same, and then pass it to their opponent.  Players then reset the timer and again arrange words from the letter cubes, essentially trying to do a better job of it than their opponent since they are using the same letters.  Highest combined score from both rounds wins.&#10;&#10;Cube List:&#10;(note that letters are arranged differently on the red and black dice, but each die will have a letter set match)&#10;W4,P4,Y4,M3,U3,O1&#10;H3,N2,R2,T2,E1,O1&#10;L2,R2,T2,I2,E1,O1&#10;J6,D3,N2,R2,E1,A1&#10;Q8,G4,F4,L2,I2,A1&#10;W4,V4,D3,T2,E1,A1&#10;B4,M3,U3,N2,S2,O1&#10;X8,B4,Y4,S2,E1,A1&#10;H3,T2,L2,S2,E1,A1&#10;K5,C4,V4,U3,N2,O1&#10;Z10,C4,F4,I2,E1,A1&#10;D3,S2,R2,I2,E1,*&#10;P4,G4,M3,I2,E1,*&#10;&#10;";1976;5.84444;0.0;1;2;45;10;Word Game
4792;Tiddledy Winks;"Tiddledy Winks varies based on publisher, but they all generally have a cup or other container that sits in the center of a target.  The object of the game is to flip small smooth disks (the &quot;winks&quot;) into the cup.  This is accomplished by placing a wink on a piece of felt and then pressing down on the edge of the wink with a larger disk (the &quot;tiddledy&quot;) so that the wink pops up into the air, and hopefully lands in the cup.  The highest points are awarded for winks that land in the cup, with winks landing in the target area scoring less.  Players decide ahead of time to play a set number of rounds (in which case the winner is the person with the highest score at the end of the last round), or to play until someone reaches a certain score (in which case the winner is the first person to reach or exceed that score).&#10;&#10;Wikipedia notes that Joseph Assheton Fincher filed the original patent application for the game in 1888, applied for the trademark Tiddledy-Winks in 1889, and licensed John Jaques and Son as the exclusive distributors of the game. However, the intense popularity of the game prompted other publishers to churn out cheaper competitors under names like Spoof, Flipperty Flop, Jumpkins, Golfette, Maro, Flutter. As early as 1890, Jacques boxes included a label warning of &quot;worthless imitations... issued by unscrupulous and jealous persons&quot;, and its rules threatened that &quot;proceedings will be taken against any one infringing the Proprietors' Rights in this Game&quot;.&#10;&#10;";1888;4.0353;1.1061;1;6;10;4;Action / Dexterity, Children's Game
4793;Glib;"&quot;The modern version of the traditional game of categories&quot; sayeth the box and this is indeed the same categories game people have been playing for decades under various names (Scattergories, Facts in Five, etc.).  What makes this game a bit different is the &quot;Glib Machine&quot;.  At the start, nine of the letter tiles are placed into the appropriate spots on the machine.  The handle is then pulled so that new categories are revealed in the windows above each letter.  The sand timer is turned over, and everyone quickly writes down the name of something that fits the category and begins with the given letter tile.  Once time runs out, the players score their answers.  Players score five points for every player that did not put down the same answer as they did.  So players not only have to come up with a correct answer, they need to find one unique enough not to be duplicated by the other players.  The player with the highest score after a certain number of rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;";1965;0.0;0.0;1;4;30;10;Party Game, Word Game

No audio comes with these games, just clue booklets and party planner.&#10;&#10;Murder on the Millennium -Or- Who's Killing Time?&#10;&#10;It's the turn of the Century, and you're standing on the brink of a whole new Millennium. What an exciting time to be alive! Especially since you've been invited to attend a very special Millennium New Year's Eve dinner given by that famous entrepreneur and inventor, Millford &quot;Mill&quot; N. Iam. Yes, Mill has invented a time travel machine and will be transporting one outstanding individual from each decade of the last century to attend this extraordinary dinner. Of course, the party will be held at Mill N. Iam's historic castle of a home, in sunny Southern California. When dinner is over, all the attendees will cast their vote for the Person of the Century. It's a party you won't want to miss, a real once-in-a-lifetime event, a night to reminisce about days gone by . . . That is, for all who live to remember . . .&#10;&#10;Candidates for the PERSON OF THE CENTURY include: (By Decade)&#10;&#10;1900-1910, Emma Rhymere is probably the foremost poet and novelist of the last century. Born and raised in Boston, she's traveled the country by train, reading her book of poetry, Moors, Mores, and S'mores, to the uneducated masses across the Western frontier. Criticizing the gluttony of the rich, Emma is level-headed and lovely, and wears the high-collared, lace-adorned clothing of her time.&#10;&#10;1910-1920, Mia Curall is easily considered the greatest scientist of the twentieth century. Having won Nobel prizes for both medicine and physics, her greatest claim to fame came when she discovered a cure for Bigpox. She's often described as being methodical and a little bit maniacal when it comes to her work, though socially, people say she has an electro-magnetic personality. She wears the latest of post-war clothing.&#10;&#10;1920-1930, Rich A. Phellar, the owner of Substandard Oil, is easily the wealthiest man of the twentieth century. Having inherited his money from his father, Rich considers himself a true blueblood. Though he's hard-nosed and hard-handed when it comes to business, in social settings he's refined and respectable, a true gentleman. Of course, he wears only tails and a top hat for evening events.&#10;&#10;1930-1940, Scarlett Harlot is probably the most gifted and gorgeous actress this century has ever known. The original fainting femme fatale, she has starred in such box office hits as: It's a Wonderful Wife, and The Lizard of Schnoz. Scarlett believes a good actress should be demure and sweet, a thing of beauty like a fine painting or sculpture. She wears only the most glamorous and glitziest of evening gowns.&#10;&#10;1940-1950, General George S. Lapem is considered one of the greatest military minds the US Army has ever known. His amazing leadership abilities, along with his talent for combat strategy, played a huge role in the winning of World War II. Gruff, rough, and tough, the General was raised in a military family and comes from a long line of Generals. He only wears army fatiques or his uniform wherever he goes.&#10;&#10;1950-1960, Eve N. Louder is probably the greatest fashion designer of the century. But she's also the founder of Eve N. Louder Cosmetics, one of the world's top-selling companies when it comes to make-up and perfume. Rich, spoiled and eccentric, Eve considers herself to be the original fashion police, claiming her only real goal is to make the world a more beautiful place. She always wears dresses of her own design.&#10;&#10;1960-1970, Blaze A. G'laury is an all-American hero, one of the first men in space, circling the globe during a top-secret space mission, better known as the Neanderthal project. Originally from Oklahoma, Blaze is a big, brave, brawny and brainy guy, who grew up reading science fiction. Not only does he have the right stuff, but women everywhere refer to him as &quot;Mr. Right.&quot; Blaze wears jumpsuits wherever he goes.&#10;&#10;1970-1980, Polly Esther Pance is probably the most influential journalist and activist this century has ever known. Founder of The Save the Sasquatch Society, an organization dedicated to the preservation of Big Foot, Polly has been involved in sit-ins and shutouts, march-downs and walkouts. She only wears the finest polyester clothes and never goes anywhere without a hefty slathering of blue eyeshadow.&#10;&#10;1980-1990, Wylie &quot;Wy&quot; Toukay, is considered one of the greatest entrepreneurs of the century, having essentially created the personal computer industry as well as the software industry that goes along with it. With an I.Q. that tops the genius range, Wy ushered the world into the Information Age and became a ga-zillionaire in the process. Wy dresses purely for comfort, never really caring about what he wears.&#10;&#10;1990-1999, US President William &quot;Willy&quot; Groper is probably one of the more colorful presidents of the century. Described as having a dichotomous disposition, he's often charismatic and calculating, charming and crafty. With his award-winning smile, Willy is a real go-getter, a man whose cause has unfortunately, caused a few improprieties. Willy only wears clothes that bare a Presidential insignia.&#10;&#10;This is an especially fun game if you and your guests plan to dress in costumes! Because the character roles span the entire century, everyone will be wearing fashions from a different decade. Hence you'll have Emma Rhymere in her long skirts comparing herself to Polly Esther Pance, in a pantsuit or mini-skirt. How shocking! The true gentleman, Rich A. Phellar, will be appalled by Wy Toukay's casual attire, especially at dinner!&#10;&#10;To make things even more fun, the characters from the later decades will already know the history which the characters from the earlier decades are living. Plus, the characters from the earlier part of the century will be amazed by the world of the future, the world of computers and faxes and fast cars.&#10;&#10;All in all, this game has a number of interesting dimensions that will keep your guests entertained for hours!&#10;&#10;";1999;0.0;0.0;10;10;180;18;Deduction, Murder / Mystery

4810;BattleBoard;"&quot;The strategy attack game with air-raising action!&quot;&#10;&#10;Each player has four knight pieces and one king piece.  At the beginning of the game they are placed in the row furthest from the dividing wall.  Players take turns moving one of their pieces one space (orthogonally).  They then get to use their &quot;air catapult&quot; to try to pop out one of their opponent's pieces.  This is done by placing their plunger in one of the vacant spaces on their side of the board and then banging it.  If their opponent has a piece in that corresponding space, it will pop up into the air.  Pieces captured in this way remain out of the game until that player moves his king up to the dividing wall, at which point he can claim a captured knight piece back (but also tips off his opponent that his king is in the front row).  The first player to move two pieces into the front row (next to the dividing wall) wins the game.&#10;&#10;";1972;5.12442;1.0;2;2;30;7;Abstract Strategy, Action / Dexterity, Medieval

4816;Xactika;"Xactika is an original card game that challenges players' ability to estimate the outcome of playing eight cards. You must predict the chances of being able to take the other players' cards that are laid down during each round. There is no drawing or discarding. You must predict exactly &ndash; hence the name Xactika &ndash; the number of rounds in which you will be able to take the cards played. Cards that appear too weak to take a trick initially may become strong enough to do so as the hand evolves. Players must recognize the value of their hand, not just from having the highest point cards in one of the four combinations on each card, but also from an understanding of the chances that for some of their other cards that no cards of the same combination may remain in the hands of the other players. Xactika, while of the same genre as Spades or Euchre, has more opportunity and takes a little more skill.&#10;&#10;To play you must examine your hand to find cards in specific combinations that have values that are greater than your opponents. Some cards are sure bets, but only if you can take the lead. Other cards have a high probability of taking a trick, but this depends upon how the cards are played by others. So, careful attention must be paid to the moves of other players. You must also arrange to play your cards so that at the end of each hand you don't get stuck with a trick you don't want. The outcome of a hand is not determined until the end of the eight rounds, so each player must keep focused on the play throughout each of the eight hands of the game. Keep on your toes, and figure out how to take, as well as avoid taking, tricks. There are a number of ways to play each hand, but finding the way to make exactly the right numbers of bids is the challenge.&#10;&#10;";2002;5.75422;1.9792;2;10;45;12;Card Game

Five cards are dealt to each player, on the cards are a 'something' When the dealer says &quot;Dig!&quot; all players turn up their top card and begin digging through the letters in the pile to spell a word descriptive of their card. The winner is the person who spells a word for all five cards.&#10;&#10;Scoring is simply paying the winner a &quot;piece of eight&quot; for each uncompleted card in your hand. Each person must also pay one &quot;piece of eight&quot; per letter that his longest word is shorter than the winner's longest word. If the winner misspells a word, or has not actually completed all 5 cards he must pay all other players 2 &quot;pieces of eight.&quot;&#10;&#10;Variants include setting a minimum number of letters for words or only allowing a word to be used once for any card during the game.&#10;&#10;First published in January 1940, it must have been a hit.  The second edition followed in March, 1940.  By February 1942 they were on the 30th edition!&#10;&#10;";1940;6.3125;1.25;2;16;15;6;Children's Game, Party Game, Real-time, Word Game
4818;Empire;"Empire is a strategic level, traditional hex grid and counter wargame set in a hypothetical ancient era continent.  The game is best with 4 players but can be played with 3 or 2.   Players must manage the economic, diplomatic and military affairs of their faction as they vie for control of the Empire.  Piece density is low &ndash; 117 units.  The game is low to moderate complexity by traditional wargame standards.&#10;&#10;The map contains 15 (fictional) provinces of varying sizes and terrain.  There is a large ocean area.  Each Province produces Tribute (in gold coins) for the player who controls it, the amount depending upon the number and size of cities in the Province.  Tribute is spent on building units, supplying units in the field, diplomatic initiatives, building fortifications, hiring mercenaries, and bribing other players.&#10;&#10;Military units are Light and Heavy Cavalry, Light and Heavy Infantry, Imperial Guards Infantry, Warships and Siege Engines.  No province can produce all of these and some can only produce 1 or 2.  Units attain Veteran status after engaging in battle, which increases their effectiveness.  Mercenaries can be hired from neutral provinces but cost more to supply than regular units.  Naval battles and amphibious operations are possible (and may be necessary, as one Province is an island).&#10;&#10;Units use an innovative combination of area movement (in friendly territory) and hex-by-hex movement (elsewhere).  Cavalry moves first and, uniquely, exerts a Zone of Control.&#10;&#10;Each Province may, at any given point, be neutral or controlled by a player.  Control may be obtained by military means (by occupying all of the province&rsquo;s cities) or political.  A wide variety of events trigger an &ldquo;Influence Check&rdquo;, which can result in a change of Political Control.  The Political Control system is really the heart of the game.&#10;&#10;The turn sequence consists of interlocking phases: each &ldquo;year&rdquo; contains an annual phase for collecting tribute and resolving control changes, 4 seasonal turns for building and supplying units and conducting diplomacy (etc.), and 12 campaign turns for military operations (campaigning in winter is more costly).&#10;&#10;The map is printed on glossy paper; the counters are on thick cardboard but need to be cut out.&#10;&#10;Overall, Empire presents some innovative game mechanics which complement its theme well.  Fans of ancient era wargames or games with a strong diplomatic element should take a look.&#10;&#10;";2000;7.3;3.0;2;4;240;12;Abstract Strategy, Ancient, Political, Territory Building, Wargame

Charming and easygoing, Tilly often dresses in the same comfortable casualness as Barpha herself. Because everyone knows, life in the television world can be very erratic. But for Tilly, there could be no other life.&#10;&#10;Ray Zhor Sharpe is a traveling knife salesman who supplies Barpha with all her cooking and crafts cutlery. Having had Ms. DeStue on his client list for many years now, Ray has always been highly dependable in providing her with the finest cutlery in the business - something that's terribly important to one who has such a great need for knives as Barpha. Personally, Ray is a no-frills, old-fashioned kind of guy, who works hard to support his family.&#10;&#10;This mystery is a parody on one of the great home entertaining gurus of our time, whose name we shall not mention . . .&#10;&#10;In comparison, this game is written for those of you with very busy lives, who still want to do a little entertaining now and then.

Opp herself.&#10;&#10;Tito Tellar is a man of great mystery and intrigue. Though very little is known about Tito, he's often been seen traveling across Europe, never far from the front lines. Always keeping his emotions in check, he's known to be impeccably groomed and well-dressed. Yet oddly enough, no one seems to know where he comes from, or for that matter, where he's been.&#10;&#10;Major Hornswagle &quot;Horn&quot; D. Augge, is the military man in charge of Bea B. Opp's USO tour group. He's an officer who takes great pride in the way he handles his entertainers, particularly his female entertainers. Flamboyant and fun-loving, he joined the armed services when he realized a uniform is like a magnet when it comes to attracting the opposite sex.&#10;&#10;Jessica &quot;Jess&quot; Abell, can easily be described with one word - patriotism, with a capital P. She would do anything to help our boys fighting overseas. First there was her stint as a factory worker, a regular Rosie the Riveter, building airplanes to wipe out the Third Reich. After retiring there, she came to work as Bea B. Opp's personal secretary, traveling with the USO tour and bringing happiness to fighting men everywhere.&#10;&#10;W.A.C. Pilot Bunny &quot;Bun&quot; P. Landon, is the pilot who transports Bea B. Opp's USO troupe across the ocean and throughout Europe. It's the opportunity of a lifetime for Bun. She's wanted to fly professionally since she was a little girl, when her father, the late Colonel Girrup Landon, first took her for a spin in a biplane. Spunky, gutsy, and known to dress in either great glitz or her flying fatigues, she always personalizes her outfits with a monogram.&#10;&#10;Oliver &quot;Ol&quot; W. Ashedup, is Miss Opp's agent and manager. A shrewd and charismatic businessman, without him, Bea wouldn't be where she is now. Ol is the kind of man who enjoys working hard, but likes to play just as hard. When he's not busy promoting his star, he's a happy-go-lucky, modern man of the 40s, who's not afraid to have a little fun once in a while.&#10;&#10;Harry Lumbar is a world-renowned Big Band leader, one of the country's finest. His songs are heard in every dance hall in the free world, and hummed in the homes of his fans everywhere. The name Harry Lumbar can hardly be mentioned without being followed with such descriptions as &quot;brilliant&quot; or &quot;genius.&quot; Personally, Harry thrives on his stardom, especially since he worked so hard to get where he is. Cordially charming and never too busy for his public, his stints in the USO show have only made him even more popular than ever.&#10;&#10;Winona &quot;Wi&quot; Bauther, is the youngest daughter of that famous Vaudeville family act, the Royal Bauthers.

Refined and ravishing, she runs the Ritch household so Eli can run the ranch. For she's a woman who knows her priorities and her place, and puts her husband first. Always wearing the latest of fashions from the East, she's a real society lady. Though it's rumored that her past may not be so reputable . . .&#10;&#10;Bad Billy Bob Bobbitt is a rawboned rambler, known to travel from town to town, though no one seems to know what he does for a living. And while he's as good with a gun as he is at the gambling table, word has it his picture has been seen on more than one Wanted Poster. Shifty and shady, he's usually dressed to ride the range.&#10;&#10;Burgandy &quot;Bur&quot; Dello, a favorite at the local watering hole, the Sure Shot Saloon, is the Belle of the Bar and star of the cancan. Having gotten her start in San Francisco, she prefers life in the wilds of Southern Colorado. She's saucy and showy, and known throughout the West for her charms that men just can't resist.&#10;&#10;Chief Lost'Um Land is an elder from the little-known Sowee tribe, formerly located high in the Southern Rockies, but now living on a desert reservation in New Mexico. Diplomatic and insightful, he's greatly respected among his own people, as well as the white men's agencies. For he often says, &quot;It's never a good day to die.&quot; And of course, he always dresses in his native attire and carries his hatchet everywhere.&#10;&#10;Virginia &quot;Virgin&quot; Gnomoire, is the local school marm, having relocated to the Wild West from the civilized East, where she received her formal education. She's intelligent, articulate, and patient with her students. But beneath her prim and proper exterior, as well as her conservative clothing, she's a raging beauty.&#10;&#10;S. Cooper &quot;Coop&quot; DeNuze, is also from the East. Both a newspaper writer and a novelist for 7&cent; novels, he's come to the West to capture the colorful characters that have aroused the curiosity of Easterners. Outgoing and inquisitive, Coop prides himself on getting the story that sells the copy. He always dresses professionally,and since he's been out West, he sometimes wears a combination of Eastern and Western attire.&#10;&#10;Manfred &quot;Man&quot; Euell Laybore, is a hard-working, honest man whose backbreaking efforts helped build the railroad that Eli now runs. Strong and ruggedly handsome, Man is known to be up front and direct in his dealings. Yet he's widely popular with the other railroad workers and known to be a leader when it comes to labor issues. His attire usually fits the occasion: whether that means working on the tracks or attending a Sunday social.&#10;&#10;Aimee &quot;Aim&quot; Ann Chute, is considered the best aim in the West, and is the star of Beaver Bob's Mild West Show. Independent and headstrong, she first learned to shoot to put food on the table. Now as she travels the countryside with the Show, she lets no man run her life. She's considered a woman years ahead of her time and often wears pants or pantskirts.&#10;&#10;See the West as it never was . . . Or at least, we hope it was never like this . . .&#10;&#10;Not only does this game have some amusing and not-too-terribly-bright characters, but this game is especially fun when it comes to costume potential! When your guests arrive at your party wearing 1880s attire, you'll see a complete transformation of their personalities. This is your chance to travel back to a colorful time in history, when the West was still wild and untamed. The setting is Durango, Colorado, where an 1880s train still takes sightseers through the splendor of the Southern Rockies.&#10;&#10;";1996;7.0;0.0;8;8;180;18;Deduction, Murder / Mystery
4822;Mysteries by Vincent: Hard Drive Homicide;"How to Host a Murder styled party game.  No audio comes with these games, just clue booklets and party planner.&#10;&#10;HARD DRIVE HOMICIDE -or- Who Offed the Icon?&#10;&#10;Welcome to Sillycon Valley, California, and to the Boardroom of Snaphu Software, Inc., where you've been summoned by the CEO himself, Major Hugh G. Snaphu, to attend an urgent late-night business meeting. The reason for the meeting remains a mystery, though the Major did mention in his email that &quot;the sparks would be flying.&quot; Could Snaphu Software have slipped from the #1 spot in the hard-core software wars? And why did the Major invite his main competitor, Bill D. Phences, CEO of MacroHard, Inc.? And what is the secret behind Snaphu Software's meteoric rise to the top anyway, especially since, prior to owning his company, Major Snaphu had been an Airforce jet jockey, and knew nothing about software? In any case, this is one meeting that's sure to be murder . . .&#10;&#10;ALSO ATTENDING TONIGHT'S MEETING WILL BE:&#10;&#10;Florence &quot;Flo&quot; P. Disque, the lovely and luscious Personal Administrative Assistant to Major Hugh G. Snaphu, CEO of Snaphu Software. Highly efficient and energetic, Flo is a master at anticipating the needs of her boss, aware of what he wants even before he asks. She's gung ho and outgoing, and known to be gutsy when going after a goal. And despite working in a corporate setting, as a former cosmetics salesperson, Flo prefers the most feminine of fashions.&#10;&#10;Bill D. Phences, now in second place in the software wars, thanks to Major Hugh G. Snaphu's meteoric rise to the top. Yet Bill is still called the King of the Computer Software Industry, since his company, MacroHard, held the #1 position for years. With an IQ of 392, Bill is not only resourceful and rich, but known to be ruthless when it comes to the competition. He always wears a business suit and glasses.&#10;&#10;Harvey &quot;Har&quot; D. Riive, a computer software engineer who graduated from MIT before he'd even acquired all his permanent teeth. A true child prodigy, he is now Snaphu Software's top technical talent, helping the company rein high above the rest. Brilliant and baby-faced, Har is far too busy to find time for fun, let alone notice the change in fashions. Thus his wardrobe tends to be slightly outdated. As an asthmatic, he carries his inhaler wherever he goes.&#10;&#10;C.D. Rhomme, the wise and wondrous Head of Accounting for Snaphu Software, who is highly qualified when it comes to calculating. Born and raised in Arizona, C. D. has always had an aptitude for arithmetic. Often described as being amicable and equitable, C. D. appreciates people as well as corporate profits. When it comes to clothing, C.D. is thankful for the latest trend in &quot;Business Casual&quot; attire.&#10;&#10;Margaret &quot;Mar&quot; Keating, the marvelous Director of Marketing at Snaphu Software. Pretty as well as professional, Mar is known for her niceness, and sometimes considered too naive for the hard core world of computer software. But Mar often defends herself by saying, &quot;I'm only kind until someone crosses my path. Then that's the last stupid thing they do.&quot; Mar wears nothing but business suits and professional attire.&#10;&#10;Sergei &quot;Ser&quot; F. Dinette, the Director of the Shipping Department at Snaphu Software. As a former United States Postal worker, Ser thrives on efficiency. But in his job and with his work load, efficiency counts. For as far as he's concerned, the Shipping Department is the pulse of the company. Direct and determined, Ser is a big believer in honest and up-front communication. He prefers to wear military-type clothing.&#10;&#10;A. Leanne Baybee, the gorgeous gal pal of Major Hugh G. Snaphu. Yet despite her striking good looks, Leanne truly subscribes to the maxim that beauty is only skin deep. Unique, extravagant and known to be an independent thinker, she might be considered unusual by the average citizen. But she hardly cares about criticism from the mediocre masses, as she lives by her own set of standards. Of course, she has an exceptional sense of fashion, one that always flatters her features.&#10;&#10;S. P. Anaugge, a computer software engineer new to Snaphu Software. Dedicated and detail-oriented, S.P. is determined to make a good impression, and not afraid to work long, long hours, sometimes staying at the office late at night when no one else is around. For S.P. knows that perseverance and persistence can bring great rewards, not to mention an early retirement. Wanting to fit in with the company dress code, S.P. wears appropriate professional attire.&#10;&#10;This game is the ultimate in easy entertaining! In fact, it's the kind of game where you can call a bunch of friends the day before and put the party on the next night. It's written for food delivery and the costumes only require your guests to go to their closets. Plus, two of the characters, C.D. Rhomme and S.P. Anaugge, can be played as either male or female characters, so you don't have to worry about getting an even number of men and women. Like I said, it's the absolute easiest mystery game to host!&#10;&#10;And because the setting is a late-night business meeting, I suggest serving the food on paper plates and using plastic utensils. The drinks can be served in mismatched coffee cups, since people in a work environment would each have their own coffee mug. To make things even more fun, I'd also recommend hanging a few pie charts around, showing the comparison between Snaphu Software and MacroHard Software.&#10;&#10;Besides all that, these are some of the funniest characters we've ever created. Flo P. Disque is cosmetically challenged, and A. Leanne Baybee is absolutely . . . well . . . you'll just have to play the game and find out!&#10;&#10;";1998;0.0;0.0;8;8;180;18;Deduction, Murder / Mystery

No audio comes with these games, just clue booklets and party planner.&#10;&#10;LYNCHED IN LUCRE VALLEY -or- Who Rigged the Rig?&#10;&#10;It's July, 1952, and the oil industry has been booming in Alberta, Canada since the end of WWII. New oil reserves have been discovered just as fast as wildcatters can set up rigs and drill. As a result, new oil and oilfield service companies have been springing up like Alberta winter wheat. One such company is Drye Holle Drilling, founded by Mr. Dryesdale &quot;Drye&quot; Holle of Lucre Valley. And tonight, you've been invited to attend the company's First Annual Safety Award Dinner, in honor of Drye Holle Drilling's remarkable safety record. And of course, the affair will be catered by the local Crude Cafe.&#10;&#10;Now the real question remains: Will Drye Holle Drilling have an outstanding safety record for a second year in a row? In any case, one thing is certain, murder would definitely mar that record . . .&#10;&#10;Your Dinner Companions Include:&#10;&#10;Tarra &quot;Tar&quot; Sanze is a sassy secretary who mans the front lines of Drye Holle Drilling. Known for her smarts as well as her savvy, she's a tornado on the typewriter and a dervish when it comes to dictation. Pretty as well as proficient, she's had more than her share of suitors, but the oil industry remains the love of her life. She dresses to fit the occasion - pants or skirts for trips to the field and dazzling dresses for dinner.&#10;&#10;Derek Hand is the dashing Drilling Manager at Drye Holle Drilling, a company Derek has worked for since he and Drye returned from the War in Europe. Hard working and an industry expert, Derek's loyalty to the company is legendary. Because he's constantly on call, he prefers to wear casual work clothes.&#10;&#10;Madame Mae Kittup is an exotic beauty from the Ukraine, a gypsy woman whose psychic powers include telling the future via her magic pysankas, or Ukrainian Easter eggs. Sultry and mysterious, Madame Mae is employed by Drye Holle Drilling to locate oil reserves far beneath the Earth's surface. Yet she attributes her great gift to her grandmother, and prefers to dress in the clothing of her native land.&#10;&#10;Denver Driller is a rich and rugged oilman from the States, whose business frequently brings him to Canada, where he plans to reap the rewards of the country's bountiful resources. A world traveler, he's charming and charismatic, and a favorite among the locals. He dresses to suit the occasion, with a wardrobe that ranges from designer suits to dungarees.&#10;&#10;Olivia &quot;Ol&quot; Barrinesse could be described in three simple words: rich, refined and ravishing. Originally from Calgary, she's the daughter of the late Brigham Barrinesse, from whom she inherited her wealth, as well as her independent and highly profitable oil company, Brigham Oil. Ol is always dressed in the height of fashion, famous for her foreign shopping sprees and her bounty of baubles.&#10;&#10;Andre P. Renure is a bold businessman who provides a valuable service to the oilfield consumer by running Lucre Valley's only general store and restaurant, the Crude Cafe. A Frenchman from Quebec, he came to the West after the War, hoping to amass a fortune from his vocational ventures. Shrewd and sophisticated, his suits are the latest of fifties fashions.&#10;&#10;Beulah &quot;Beu&quot; T. Kween is a beaming beauty from the heart of bovine country, who was raised on a cattle ranch in southern Alberta. Having won more than her share of beauty contests, everyone says her future is bright, that she'll be married with a house full of kids before she can say &quot;baby boom.&quot; Flirtatious and fun-loving, she currently works as a waitress at the Crude Cafe, where she earns enough money to keep her wardrobe stocked with delectable dresses.&#10;&#10;Royal T. Ohhner is an Alberta cattle rancher whose range reaches far across some big beefy underground oil reserves - oil reserves that are leased to and drilled by Drye Holle Drilling. Thus Royal often jokes about raising both crude and cattle, which have proven to be real cash cows for him. A real grass roots kind of guy, he's never been one to steer away from hard work. He wears nothing but Western attire.&#10;&#10;This mystery game features a Western Canadian setting. (If you've never seen Calgary and the Canadian Rockies, then you've never really lived!) So, of course, we used some classic characters that you might find in that neck of the bush -- the Frenchman from Quebec, the Ukranian woman and her psyankas (decorated eggs), a cattle rancher and the people in the oil industry. Of course, there's also a mention of playing hockey.&#10;&#10;Besides all that, it's set in the early 1950s, which provides so much opportunity for costumes, as well as setting the mood. People can dress either 1940s or 1950s style, and you can easily play music from both decades.&#10;&#10;All and all, it's a fun romp, with the same lunacy and ludicrousness as the rest of our mystery games. Watch out for the surprise twist at the end!&#10;&#10;";1997;5.0;0.0;8;8;180;18;Deduction, Murder / Mystery

It's all the rage! Your ticket to fun and frolic awaits you: dated June 18, 1925, when flappers were risque' and prohibition was the rule. The festivities will culminate on Saturday night with a private dinner party hosted by Rum himself. (And because you'll be dining in Rum's suite, you might find the laws of prohibition to be a little . . . shall we say . . . less restrictive?) It should be a night to remember. That is, provided everyone makes it through the night . . .&#10;&#10;Your Dinner Companions Include:&#10;&#10;Princess Anastasia &quot;Ann&quot; L. Retentov claims to be the only surviving descendant of that great Russian Retentov line. And because of a little-known twist of history, she is the last remaining heir to the Russian throne, daughter of Czar Frugalin Retentov I and Czarina Wautor Retentov. Having fled the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution, Ann came to America for sanctuary. As a princess, she carries herself regally, being a classic Russian beauty and dressing in the finest of fashions.&#10;&#10;Dewey Kare, is a baseball legend who has redefined the game, being both a pitching phenom and a home run hitter. But being worshiped as a hero got tiresome for Dewey. So he recently retired, and has traveled to the wilds of Montana in search of a new adventure. Yet he never forgets his years in the big leagues, and always wears a baseball jersey.&#10;&#10;Cassandra &quot;Cass&quot; Piajammas is a lovely &amp; luscious starlet, having recently starred in her latest film, The Monotony of Marlene. And soon she is to grace the silver screen as Valentino's leading lady. Which is no surprise, considering acting is a talent that comes quite naturally to Cass. After all, her mother always did say Cass was a little melodramatic. But she's also a thoroughly modern woman of the twenties, a real flapper. And like most flappers, she's opinionated, daring and slightly out-of-control.&#10;&#10;Barry &quot;Bare&quot; Marquette is a Wall Street whiz known for his gutsy gambles and daring dealings. He loves the excitement of the market, with all the ups and downs, and the dangers as well as the chance to get rich quick. Born and raised in Chicago, he tried a number of jobs at home before finally going to New York to be near the market. And because he's much sought after by women, he dresses in the height of style, sparing no expense to look dashing and dapper.&#10;&#10;Isadore &quot;Izzy&quot; A. G. Mann has often been described as a chameleon-like character, easily able to change and adapt to any situation, at any time. Thus he always dresses to fit the occasion. And because he's come to Montana on vacation and wants to relax, he doesn't care to talk about his work much - though he will admit to being employed by the government. Focused and determined, he's a hard worker, and never quits until he gets the job done right.&#10;&#10;Stephanie &quot;Steph&quot; D. Rink is a prim and pretty prohibitionist, probably one of the most popular in the country. For her name is synonymous with sober. Often called Sister Steph, she's the founder of the Church of the Triple R - the Real Right Reformed. As a staunch activist and a prolific preacher, she's known to be quite vocal. And because she's always in the public eye, she's particular about her appearance, and often quick to follow the latest fashion fads.&#10;&#10;Senator Vito D. Beale is a United States Senator from Illinois. A man of great power and passion, politics is in his blood, as he comes from a well-established and wealthy political family. Vito chooses his issues carefully and then fights for them to the finish. Yet he's also quite charming and cordial to the voters, and because he's got an important public image to uphold, he always dresses to the nines.&#10;&#10;Mary Widdoe, is a strikingly beautiful and well-to-do young widow who just recently lost her husband. Now, wherever she goes, she carries the urn that holds the ashes of her late husband Ernie, for as she says: &quot;He made me everything I am.&quot; Her friends describe her as being wonderfully charming and a great listener. And as a grieving widow, Mary often wears black, though usually in the form of designer dresses.&#10;&#10;This mystery game is especially fun for history buffs. Not only is the main storyline centered around Prohibition, but many of the characters are based (loosely) on actual historic figures. Izzy A. G. Mann, is a spoof on Izzy Einstein, one of the most famous Prohibition Agents of all. Of course, Princess Ann L. Retentov, is based somewhat on Annastasia Romanov.&#10;&#10;This game also has some special features that others don't have. For instance, a few of the clues are to be hidden around the room, and this game includes an &quot;X&quot; that marks the spot, though I won't tell you where.&#10;&#10;Costumes from the twenties are especially fun, as that was the era of flappers and men in wide-lapeled pinstriped suits. Also popular at the time was a train ride from Chicago to Montana, to enjoy the splendor of Yellowstone.&#10;&#10;If you like history, you'll love this mystery!&#10;&#10;";1996;0.0;0.0;8;8;180;18;Deduction, Murder / Mystery

Orty Kulchure, local professor of Botany, who also served as the judge for last month's rose competition. Dr. Kulchure will be speaking on the subject of &quot;Practical Pruning, or Using Those Dead Limbs for Fertilizer.&quot;&#10;&#10;With the motto, &quot;Our Petals are Perpetually Open,&quot; you might say the Phunguss Flats Garden Club has a long and lascivious history, one that's fueled a lot of talk around the town.&#10;&#10;For all who live to talk about it, that is . . .&#10;&#10;Members of the Phunguss Flats, Florida Garden Club Are:&#10;&#10;Mumsy Worde is the President of the Phunguss Flats Garden Club.

She wears mostly skirts and sweaters.&#10;&#10;Auntie Pausto is as famous for her pasta as she is for her petunias. A first generation Italian-American, Auntie Pausto is proud of her heritage.

It's May, 1955 and time once again for the monthly meeting of the Liberty Library League. This meeting promises to be one you won't want to miss, with plenty of topics to talk about. First of all, Nona Tumuch, the famous author who recently released that scandalous best-seller, Paytown Placed, has finally decided to step off that high-and-mighty horse she's been riding and join the Liberty Library League. Though one must wonder, what made her finally accept an invitation and be part of a group she has spurned for so long?&#10;&#10;Of course, there will also be the final dollar count from last week's Library League Bake Sale. Hopefully, with the sales of the goodies from Cooky Kuttre and Meena Ann Moody, the Library League might finally be able to afford that statue of the famous Outlaw Jose Whines, who once called Liberty his home. Oh, and speaking of Meena Ann Moody, she's let everyone know that she'll be making a big announcement at the meeting, one she claims will impact everyone's lives. Hopefully she won't be pulling any dusty skeletons from any musty closets, as no doubt, everyone's got a few secrets they'd rather remained that way . . . SECRET!

Sassy, showy, and sharp-witted, Garnett prefers flashy frocks and jeweled accessories.&#10;&#10;Cooky Kuttre is an acutely happy homemaker, a woman who finds total fulfillment from merely meeting the needs of her man, her husband, Mete Kuttre.

She also brags about having a house where &quot;dirt dare not tread, for fear it will instantly be sucked into the vacuum bag.&quot; Active, opinionated, and organized, Cooky wears simple dresses and never goes anywhere without her apron.&#10;&#10;Madame Fabra Cates is a clairvoyant who recently relocated to Liberty, after her spirit guides strongly suggested she move here. Fabra not only tells the future by reading tea leaves, but she also claims to communicate with those who have passed from this life to the next. Temperamental, thoughtful, and theatrical, Fabra prefers to wear wildly colored clothing, with lots of jewelry and a bright headscarf.&#10;&#10;Gussie D. Uppe has recently returned home to Liberty, after mysteriously being away for six months. A trust-fund tot, her father owns the biggest bank in Liberty, and Gussie grew up with an abundance of riches. She is often considered the best bridge player in town, though she is also quite adept at Canasta and Charades, and many other party games. Tight-lipped, tenacious, and trustworthy, Gussie wears the latest of designer clothes, hats and gloves.&#10;&#10;Luv Swept is a writer of romance novels and has recently moved to Liberty to research the tragic life and death of her long, lost twin brother, Adonis Studd.

4831;NFL Strategy;"NFL Strategy is a football game based on plays and the ability to execute them rather than on team statistics. The number of offensive plays and defensive plays varies with each edition and one special teams card are included. Each player secretly chooses his play. The defensive play (which has clear &quot;windows&quot; on it)is played on top of the offensive play to reveal five possible outcomes of the play. To find the result you roll two six sided dice and add them together. The dice roll determines which &quot;window&quot; the players look at and this is the result of the play. The result also takes into account whether the ball is on the left hash mark, the right hash mark or in the center of the field. Earlier versions of this game used a spring loaded bead that you flipped to determine which &quot;window&quot; to look at.&#10;&#10;";1970;6.88912;2.2273;2;2;150;10;Sports

The Germans launched Operation Yellow, the invasion of France and the Low Countries, on May 10, 1940. The main German offensive, dubbed the Sichelschnitt (razor cut), struck through the lightly defended Ardennes Forest. The Germans quickly broke through the Allied main line of defense along the Meuse River at Sedan and Dinant.&#10;&#10;German Tank and mechanized forces, led by General Erwin Rommel's 7th Panzer Division, were boldly sent racing towards the English Channel to cut the Allied forces in half. The Allies launched a desperate counter-attack against the now strung-out and vulnerable German spearhead near the town of Arras.

The Germans launched Operation Yellow, the invasion of France and the Low Countries, on May 10, 1940. The German vanguard of General Hoepner's XVI Coprs ran head-on into the defending French First Army led by General Rene Prioux at the &quot;Gembloux Gap&quot;. The Germans hoped to seize the crucial open ground between the Dyle and Meuse Rivers, unhinging the Allied line. The Germans also hoped to tie-up Allied forces here, so that they could not be used to oppose the main German offensive effort coming through the Adrennes further south.

4842;Monster Derby;"A race game between eight fantasy monsters selected at random from a deck of 25 (e.g., medusa, cyclops, vampire, zombie, centaur, dragon, griffin, djinni).  Players get secret agendas, listing the order they want the monsters to finish according to colored mover bases for the cards.&#10;&#10;On each player's turn, they move a monster toward the finish line. All monsters move forward a die roll but if you are moving a monster that doesn't score high for you, you can waste its movement by zig-zagging or wandering into non-native terrain.  Each monster must move once per round, so even those that no one likes will get moved (and present bluffing opportunities for clever players).&#10;&#10;A monster can attack once per move -- a great way to slow down a monster you don't like is to beat it unconscious.  Each monster is rated for the number of custom attack dice (marked with just 0s and 1s) they throw to find damage.  Monsters also have special powers, some active all the time and others that only kick in when a custom &quot;wacky die&quot; shows sword or shield icons.&#10;&#10;The game includes reversible mapboards with different terrain patterns (brush, rock, water, etc.) to create a wide variety of maps.  Monsters move into their native terrains as if they were blank squares and get a defensive bonus as well.  Some monsters can fly, ignoring terrain except where they land.&#10;&#10;The race ends when three monsters have crossed the finish line.  Everybody counts up the points listed on their secret agendas for those three monsters.  Example: the dragon, doppleganger, and hare finish in that order. My agenda says dragon 8, doppleganger 5, and hare 3 so I score 16 points; the monsters I had listed for positions 7, 6, 4, 2 and 1 didn't finish.&#10;&#10;Note that this description is for the 2014 edition of the game.  The original used regular dice, counters rather than cards, scored all eight finishers and had players set their own agendas (both of which stretched out the game considerably).&#10;&#10;";1994;6.16134;2.2857;2;8;45;10;Fantasy, Racing
4843;Give Me Liberty;"(from the back of the box:)&#10;&#10;Beginning in September 1775 and running through the end of 1781, Give Me Liberty! covers the military campaigns that helped create the United States of America. All of the important generals are here: George Washington, Benedict Arnold, Lafayette,&quot;Mad Anthony&quot; Wayne, &quot;Gentleman John&quot; Burgoyne, Francis (&quot;Swamp Fox&quot;) Marion, Howe, Cornwallis, etc. Special rules flesh out the men, and their unique abilities and liabilities. The game system is fast paced, and creates a challenging situation for both sides.&#10;&#10;IN ADDITION TO THE FULL CAMPAIGN GAME, there are four shorter campaign scenarios. The Invasion of Canada follows the fortunes of Arnold and Montgomery, as they attempt to add a 14th Colony to those in rebellion. Saratoga 1777 covers the British attempt to conquer the Hudson Valley. Summer 1780 features the British attempt to separate the colonies of the Deep South from their rebellious brethren to the North, and finally Greene's Carolina Campaign follows the attempt by Nathaniel Greene to rectify the previous year's failure by Horatio Gates.&#10;&#10;THE RULES cover Militia, promotions, supply, leader exchanges', entrenchements, initiative, attrition, politics, Indians, and even Lord Germain. The naval rules cover amphibious assaults, interception at sea, ocean transport, and blockade. Counters represent regiments, naval squadrons, leaders, artillery, Indians, the French, etc. &#10;Each turn represents 2 weeks, or a month (in winter), with strategic interphases between turns. Victory is determined by the relative standing of the two sides on a Political Track, which is in turn, determined by a variety of events and by control of the vatious colonies. &#10;The British player generally moves first in each game turn, but the American, player may, by the accumulation of Victory Points, acquire and use (at the moment of his choosing) Initiative Chits, which enable him to reverse the order of movement-s-thus seizing the initiative.&#10;&#10;Designed by award-winning designer Rob Markham, Give Me Liberty! is both an accurate and detailed simulation, and also a fast paced and intense game.&#10;&#10;CONTENTS: &#10;&#10;    One rulebook &#10;    Two 34&quot; x 22&quot; maps&#10;    400 die&middot;cut counters&#10;    One 10&middot;sided&#10;&#10;&#10;PLAYERS: 2&middot;4,also makes an excellent solitaire game.&#10;&#10;PLAYING TIME: 2-6 hours, depending upon scenario chosen.&#10;&#10;";1992;5.98596;3.25;1;4;360;12;Age of Reason, American Indian Wars, American Revolutionary War, Wargame

4851;Civil War Game 1863;"&quot;This game is played by two people.  One commands the northern forces, the other commands the southern forces.  It is up to you as one of the commanders to develop the strategy and make the decisions which will give you the best chance to win.  The course of the war is in your hands.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the year 1863, the Confederate and Union armies were closely balanced.  Either side could still win.  There were differences - the North had more troops while the South had better ones with more mobility.  But the decisive battles lay in the future.  Final victory would be determined by the same factors for the Union and the Confederacy alike: sufficient fighting strength in the right place at the right time, daring and clever tactics, and luck.  The players of this game must fight the same even fight.  The same skill, daring and luck are required of you, if you want to win.&quot; - Taken from games rules introduction.&#10;&#10;User review: There are three types of units: infantry, cavalry, and gunboats. Infantry can move one space on land each turn. Cavalry can move up to two spaces on land each turn. Gunboats may move up to two spaces each turn and may transport infantry. Units may move orthogonally and diagonally.&#10;&#10;The gameboard is an 18 x 18 grid of squares. Starting places for the units, railroads, key cities, mountains, and important waterways are denoted.&#10;&#10;Players alternate taking turns with the Confederate player moving first. Combat occurs when opposing forces occupy the same space. The rules are more detailed but a larger force always defeats the smaller force. A player forces the opponent to remove units from play by capturing any of the opponent&rsquo;s key cities.&#10;&#10;The player who eliminates all of the opponent&rsquo;s units or gets the opponent to surrender is the winner.&#10;&#10;[27 December 2012] This game was first published in Life Magazine, volume 50 number 11, 17 March 1961.

4853;Tripoley;"A standard deck playing card game played with a special layout (or board) and poker chips.  It is a modern version of the game of Poch.  Each hand has three phases: &quot;Hearts&quot;, &quot;Poker&quot;, and &quot;Michigan Rummy&quot;.  All cards are dealt out, including one extra hand which remains unseen.  Players place chips in the spaces for the special combinations on the playing mat/board, the &quot;Poker&quot; pot, and the &quot;Kitty&quot;.  The first phase pays off for holding certain cards or combinations (that match the combinations on the playing layout/board).  The second phase is a hand of poker; each player selecting five cards from his hand to play.  A hand of Poker betting takes place, with bets added to the &quot;Poker&quot; pot, and the winner wins the &quot;Poker&quot; pot.  In the third phase, players play a slight variation of the game of Michigan (similar to Fan Tan), and the first to go out wins the chips in the &quot;Kitty&quot;.&#10;&#10;The book Games We Play pictures a version of Poch published in ~1830 in Nuremberg by Verlag Fr Scharrer.  From this illustration we can see the evolution of Pope Joan to Poch, which was further refined into the Tripoley we see today.&#10;&#10;This game is a Public Domain game known as Michigan Rummy.  This name comes from the third phase where the standard deck playing card game of Michigan (&quot;Stops Family&quot;) is played.  Michigan Rummy should not be confused with the game of 500 Rum and its variation called Michigan Rum from the Rummy Family.&#10;&#10;The spots on the board are 10-J-Q-K-A of Hearts (5 spots), 8-9-10 all one suit (one spot), Q-K of Hearts (one spot), and the Kitty.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Pochspiel&#10;&#10;&#10;Also see:&#10;&#10;    Michigan Rummy&#10;&#10;&#10;";1937;5.64218;1.4762;2;9;60;8;Card Game

Unknown to other racers, each player has a secret agenda as to where their racer is to finish (e.g. 1st in Stage 1, 3rd in Stage 2, 2nd in Stage 3).  If you accomplish your goals, you score points.&#10;&#10;The board is made up of five straight lanes, each a sequence of rectangular areas, and each rectangular subdivision has four dots of the racer's path (ie, ten consecutive rectangles will require dice-rolls totaling 40 to advance through).  Players also have a hand of four cards which conveniently overlay these rectangles and which have differing numbers of dots (from 0 to 8).  On a player's turn, he or she may play one of these overlaying cards on the board so as to make any player's path longer or shorter.  Then the player rolls the dice and moves his racer.&#10;&#10;In the &quot;advanced&quot; game, each player also has a hand of four action cards, some of which can be played on others and some of which can only be played on oneself.  These actions alter player's options (e.g. &quot;play no cards,&quot; &quot;move 10 spaces rather than rolling&quot;, etc).&#10;&#10;";1994;5.95921;1.3;3;5;45;10;Dice, Racing

The game is very fast paced and a lot of fun.  The graphics on the DVD menus and the changes are very nice to watch.  Further, a new &quot;Expansion&quot; DVD is supposed to come out every three months.  As you might have guessed, you MUST have a DVD player to play this game.&#10;&#10;Expanded by with:&#10;&#10;    Scene It? HBO&#10;    Scene It? Sequel Pack: Movie Edition&#10;    Scene It?

Observers report that the balloon plummeted out of a cloudy sky into thick woods close to Airesborne Castle, killing both the duke and his son. The duke's brother, Drafton, succeeds to the title. &quot;Drafty,&quot; as he is popularly known, is in poor health and remains secluded at Airesborne Castle.&#10;Lofton received much attention several months ago when he presented a proposal to Parliament to defend the coast of England with an army of armored balloons, &quot;constantly aloft, constantly alert, and threatening death to all intruders.&quot; Though the proposal was easily defeated, Lofton persisted in the study and development of the balloons, which he stated are &quot;critical to the well-being and security of our nation.&quot;&#10;It was one such balloon that the duke and his son were testing on the morning of the crash. A spokesman for the Aires family declared, &quot;The duke had developed an advanced version of his armored balloon and was in the process of testing it when the accident occurred. Whether the crash was caused by a malfunction in the balloon or its weapons systems is not presently known.&quot;&#10;Observers of matters concerning the nobility point out that it is not clear who will be Drafton's heir, since he has no children. In cases where the duke has no natural heir, he may nominate his heir from his immediate family, according to the Royal Grant of Privilege, bestowed by Queen Elizabeth when she created the Duchy of Airesborne in 1597. It is understood that the new duke has already made plans for a family council to invoke this privilege.&#10;&#10;CHARACTERS&#10;Spendwell P. Roppwash, Melissa C.

Starting in the trading pits some 30 years ago, Bonds built his small firm into a financial services giant.

I have enclosed a brief biography of each guest. Watersdown Mansion is an old, elegant stone building situated in Yorkshire, England, and constructed in 1817. The original owner, Lord Balmy Farfrummit, made his fortune selling English pig iron to the French after Bonaparte's defeat in 1815. Roger Watersdown acquired the entire Farfrummit holdings in 1925 after the tragic death of Viscount Farfrummit aboard his sailing yacht, Frummit's Ferry, which foundered during a fierce storm off Falmouth Harbor. Sir Roger, as you may know, is the principal shareholder of the giant conglomerate Watersdown Beverages Ltd., and known far and wide as a jovial host. Female guests are cautioned that Sir Roger, after consumption of his customary evening cocktails, tends to become something of a leech. I welcome you on behalf of Sir Roger and the entire Watersdown Mansion household, and I hope your stay will be a pleasant one.&#10;&#10;CHARACTERS&#10;Dr. Malcom K.T. Praktiss, Miranda T.

Use special movement cards, dice rolls, the bus, taxi, or even shortcuts through stores to get there first and claim your reward!  Just make sure that you get there before it closes (as indicated on the super-snazzy 3D bank clock!), or you're out of time, and out of luck!&#10;&#10;Each player has a hand of 3 Crazy Cards to modify their movement and combines them with their dice roll to move along any number of paths through the city streets, in an effort to reach one of the 4 Fun City Cards active at any one point in time.  Each turn, the bank clock advances by either 10 or 20 minutes, and occasionally the SLOG (Somebody's Little Old Grandmother) will pop up, allowing the first player who escorts her between the Super Duper Market and the Library to claim any of the Fun City Cards available.  Each of the Fun City Cards is only available during a set timeframe, and the smaller the timeframe the more valuable it is.  When the clock reaches 5:00, players tally the Fun City Cards they've collected to determine the winner.&#10;&#10;";1987;5.73476;1.2308;2;4;60;8;Real-time
4911;Wacky Wizard Game;"Wacky Wizard is a game in which players assume the roles of unfortunate victims of a looney wizard.  Changed into one of six types of animals (bats, spiders, snakes, etc), the players must gather the ingredients necessary to break the spell over them.&#10;&#10;Taking turns to play, players move their pieces on the board based on the flicking of a spinner.  Ingredient discs are placed at the edges of the board and a player's piece must land exactly on the spaces to collect the items.  To break the spell over them, the creatures need to collect two different ingredients with their own symbols (e.g. a Turtle would require an Eye of Newt and a Fingernail of Newt).  If the spinner lands on the Wacky Wizard symbol, the player draws a Wizard Spell Card, which will turn his or her playing piece into another creature (and thereby changing his or her winning conditions).&#10;&#10;The first player to break the enchantment over his or her piece wins and ends the game.&#10;&#10;";1977;3.0;0.0;2;4;10;7;Dice, Movies / TV / Radio theme

4961;Sunda to Sahul;"This is a lightweight strategy game for 2 to 4 people which also includes a number of challenging puzzles for 1 player. The theme of the game is the migration of people down the Indonesian archipelago into New Guinea and Australia. The games is based on a set of 136 laser cut wooden jigsaw like tiles which go together in a multitude of ways to form a set of islands.&#10;&#10;The game starts with all of the tiles face up on the playing surface and one tile in a cleared space in the center of the playing surface to start play. Players select a tile from the pool of upturned tiles and try to join tiles to it to extend the islands of an archipelago, 'discovering' a different set of islands each time they play the game. Each player has a number of tokens for his clan or totem. The aim of the game is to claim nodes (points on the land of the islands where the corners of a number of tiles come together). The player who places the last tile at a node may claim that node for his clan. If an island is completed then all of the tokens on the island double in value. There is therefore an incentive for players who have tokens on an island to cooperate to complete the island, but of course each is trying to get more out of the cooperation than the others. The game ends when one player has used all of his tokens or when no further tiles can be placed, or when the players agree to finish.&#10;&#10;The game can be played either as a race game with all players working simultaneously or as a turns based game. The race game takes about 30-45 minutes to play, while the turns based games takes 60-90 minutes to play. There are a number of optional game elements that can be added once players are comfortable with the basic game: fresh water rights (for water surrounded by land), tribes (clan tokens in a tribe are worth more than on their own), challenges (where a player can try to convert a token to their clan), and resources (owned by the player with the most tokens on the island at the end of the game). Some of these game elements result in a more cooperative styled game while some result in more conflict. Players can mix and match the game elements to produce a style of game that suits their mood or style of play.&#10;&#10;The publisher's website http://sagacity.aires.com.au formerly had more information but appears to be defunct as of mid-2010.&#10;&#10;";2002;5.97384;2.1471;1;4;45;10;Exploration, Prehistoric, Puzzle, Real-time, Territory Building

4973;Pay Cards!;"Based on the obscure 1968-69 game show, an MC is chosen and shuffles a deck of twenty cards. The cards are inserted face-down into a numbered vinyl sheet. Players choose three numbers from the vinyl sheet and the cards are revealed. If a pair shows, the player must take all three cards. If not, the player may refuse the cards and they are turned face down and placed back onto the numbered sheet. After all cards are drawn, the hands are evaluated and the players given cash for pairs, three of a kind, four of a kind, and for highest hand in the round. The player with the most money after three rounds plays the Jackpot Game and can earn additional money. The player with the most money after the Jackpot Game wins.&#10;&#10;Three versions were apparently released: the original (&quot;Version I&quot;) has no Wild Cards and a red Jackpot spinner; the box has black copyright lettering, and the adult male wears a brown shirt. Some early copies of the release with Wild Cards (&quot;Version II&quot;) feature the same red Jackpot spinner and box design as Version I, but include the updated rules for using the Wild Card decks. Later Wild Card editions (&quot;Version III&quot;) have the updated rules and a black Jackpot spinner, plus the box has pink copyright lettering and the adult male wears a red shirt.&#10;&#10;The game was given away as a consolation prize on the show. On the one circulating episode, late in the show's run (#209 of 260, taped 4/22/69), host Art James holds up the box with the brown-shirt male. This strongly suggests that Versions II and III each had a short print run.&#10;&#10;The show did return briefly in 1981-1982 as &quot;$UPER PAY CARDS&quot;, produced in Canada for syndication in the US and Canada.

4977;VOR: The Maelstrom;"VOR is a science-fiction miniatures game that takes place inside a mysterious galaxy-sized anomaly (VOR) of unknown origin.  The anomaly randomly sucks worlds (and their inhabitants) through time-space and once in the VOR, all worlds drift toward the center (the Maelstrom) and their doom.  The inhabitants of the worlds pulled into the Vor are locked in a struggle with each other for survival.  Players fight as one of many races trapped in the VOR.&#10;&#10;VOR is a squad-based wargame from FASA (beloved publisher of material for the well-known Battletech, Traveller, Fading Suns, and EarthDawn games).  It has an extraordinarily innovative ruleset from which other games have since borrowed and with perhaps one of the best movement systems of any of the squad miniature games.  The system supports a unit popping around a corner (out of cover), shooting, and moving back efficiently.  This game uses a hit and wound determination model much like GW's Warhammer 40K.  The rules allow you to put together your own units and characters to represent new civilizations drawn into the Vor.  Yes, you can use all those miniatures from all those other games you own!!&#10;&#10;There are some interesting miniatures (such as the Growler race) included with the base game and you can purchase additional units (even some unreleased) from Iron Wind Metals and Ral Partha, but the game is now fan-supported as the original publisher is no longer actively releasing new supplements.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.88452;2.8333;2;10;90;12;Adventure, Miniatures, Science Fiction, Wargame
4979;Blood Berets;"Blood Berets was Target Games first entry into the American gaming market. It preceded the later, more popular boardgames (Mutant Chronicles: Siege of the Citadel and Fury of the Clansmen) and the English release of the roleplaying game on which it was based. Blood Berets is only slightly more complex than Siege of the Citadel and Fury of the Clansmen because it is really not much more than a streamlined version of the roleplaying game's combat system.&#10;&#10;This game included many of the rules of popular wargames, including a chit-based initiative system, cover, hidden deployment, and model facing.  It too used Target Games's one hit, one armor roll system (with a d20) for fast action.  This game was distinguished by a card for each character.  When the character was hit once (or twice, for the Nepharites), the card was turned over, revealing an injured portrait and lower stats for the injured character.  When the character was hurt twice (or four times, for the Nepharites), it died. The game is enjoyable, but since it has only three mission scenarios, it does not lend itself to much variation upon repeat plays.  The human player is aware of the general location of mutants through the use of his &quot;scanner&quot; - which is counters placed on various tiles (revealed when a tile is overturned and replaced with the appropriate miniature).  Even so, the game is an enjoyable introduction to the roleplaying game and is very adaptable for those gamers who like to tinker with rules systems to develop their own variants. The subsequent development of Warzone as a tabletop miniatures wargame added a large number of metal miniatures that could be used in variants of the game.&#10;&#10;Probably the most innovative part of the game (for its time) was the inclusion of 18 plastic miniatures for playing the game, each in its own foam compartment neatly stored in the bottom of the box. Six Blood Berets were included (1 Sgt., 1 Medic, and 4 Grunts), 10 Undead Legionnaires, and 2 Nepharites (bad guy leaders). Heartbreaker produced a limited line of miniatures suitable for use with Blood Berets shortly after the game was released. These miniatures were lead and featured the Bauhaus Rangers with the Deathlockdrum machine gunner and Sgt. with 4 Grunts. There were also lead minis of Nepharites and Undead Legionnaires.&#10;&#10;A rare poster-magazine called &quot;Sinkadus&quot; 39 &amp; 40 that was produced by Target Games AB only in Sweden, added an expansion to Blood Berets. New scenarios, rules, items and pretorian stalkers.&#10;&#10;";1993;5.77483;3.0;2;4;60;12;Adventure, Horror, Miniatures, Science Fiction, Wargame

If the Orc hordes succeed in forming a connection between the two towers, the dark side will have won and the players will all lose together.

4985;Warmaster;"Warmaster is a set of fantasy miniatures wargame rules developed by the same company as produced Warhammer, Warhammer 40,000 and Lord of the Rings miniatures rules. This is not a complete game; players are required to independantly purchase miniatures and construct a playing surface (wargames terrain). The game is scaled for 10mm miniatures (1:144, N Scale), and is designed to represent combat at the regiment and brigade level set in a fantasy/renaissance techology world.&#10;&#10;In Warmaster, combat and casualty calculations occur at the stand level. That is, for every stand in a unit, a number of dice are rolled in combat. As whole stands are removed by sustaining casualties, the number of dice similalry decreases.&#10;&#10;The command mechanism in Warmaster is simple but evocative. Each leader model has a Command factor. To issue a command, such as 'move forward' to a unit, two dice must be rolled against that target command factor. For every subsequent order attempted the target number becomes more difficult to achieve. As a consequence, despite being on the surface a move-counter move system, the turns are variable length and each player may not have the full opportunity to achieve everything they may want to. This simple mechanism introduces enjoyable tension into what is otherwise a largely conventional set of wargame rules.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Warmaster Annual 2002&#10;    Warmaster Annual 2003&#10;    Warmaster Armies&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Warmaster Ancients&#10;    The Battle of Five Armies&#10;&#10;&#10;Supported by the Warmaster magazine.&#10;&#10;";2000;7.25165;2.9074;2;99;120;12;Fantasy, Miniatures, Wargame

4997;HellRail;"The first edition of HellRail was quite different from (and in most respects inferior to) subsequent editions.  The easiest way to describe the first edition is to contrast it with the more widely known second and third (p)e(r)ditions, as only thirty (30) copies of the first edition were printed.&#10;&#10;One of the most significant differences is that the cards each have only one use in first edition, and so are divided into types:  Circle cards, Rail cards, Passenger cards, and Damnations (one-use special powers).  All cards are shuffled together at the start of the game, so the Circles are not laid out to begin as they are in later editions.  The board is formed throughout the game by placing Rail and Circle cards.&#10;&#10;Another big difference is the fact that Circle cards have no special powers in first edition.

One player (the sorcerer player) hides the wand in his realm and defends it with a group of evil sorcerers who can summon the aid of demons, orcs, and ghouls. The other player (the wizard player) invades with a force of good wizards, barbarians, dwarves, and elves, seeking to locate the wand and escape with it.&#10;&#10;Before the play of the game begins, both players secretly design their forces. The board portrays the valley of the evil sorcerers, and on it the sorcerer player places the counters representing haunts (temples, ruins, and crypts), secretly recording one of them as the haunt in which the wand is hidden. The counters representing the sorcerers and their minions are then placed on the board, and on the sorcerer player's first turn they can begin summoning other evil units. The wizard player brings in the wizard units and their allies through one or more hexes along the valley border, and the struggle begins.&#10;&#10;Each side can attack with spells and by physical combat. The wizard player should usually try to strike quickly, before the sorcerer player can organize an effective resistance. Only the sorcerer player gets a steady stream of reinforcements, in the form of wandering-orc counters, but the wizard player has the advantage of special attacking bonuses. To win, the wizard player must locate the wand and remove it from the sorcerers' valley through an entry/exit hex.&#10;&#10;";1983;5.1875;3.0;2;2;45;12;Fantasy, Wargame

Combat occurs on airless portal planets, where small infantry ground units vie with each other for victory among the frozen wastes. A player can never be sure of whom or what he will find when his troops near the battlefield.&#10;&#10;Units are equipped with weapons of the latest technology, and embark on their starships. Only weeks or months pass for them, traveling at near-light speeds, but decades pass in the universe surrounding them.

The map covers all major European and West-Asian countries ranging from Britain and France in the west to Persia and Russia in the east. Players maneuver armies, corps, and naval squadrons while engaging in mobilization, combat, and diplomacy.&#10;&#10;There are seven historical and one hypothetical scenario, plus a campaign game that links all of them into one massive 72 turn game. (One turn equals one month.)&#10;&#10;Each player begins with a set amount of resources and must manage them properly to gain victory. Run out of &quot;money&quot; (National Resource Credits) before the others and you're probably out of the game. Similarly, players have fixed mobilization pools from which to draw on to create new units. You can end up with having enough money to outfit a new infantry division but without any more young men to wear those uniforms! There are no endless supplies in this game to keep building unit after unit after unit.

5056;D.A.K.;"D.A.K. is a Strategic level board-wargame covering the battle for North Africa during WWII. The key feature of this game is its operation points which represent supply. These points are expended when units move or fight and also just to maintain a unit's existence. They're moved from the ports to the forward battle area and require record keeping.&#10;&#10;This game's supply system portrays the situation that existed. Even if you're just digging in and awaiting an attack, you still need supplies flowing to your troops to feed (and water) them. Also, because all units must be able to trace supply to exist, players are rewarded well when successfully able to cut off enemy units from their rear areas. You can even capture enemy supply depots that are located too close to the front.&#10;&#10;It can be linked with the game La Regia Marina, also published by Simulations Canada. When playing this way, the available number of operations points is based on how well you manage your fleets and convoys in La Regia Marina rather than the fixed supply schedule that comes with D.A.K.&#10;&#10;One full map is divided into Eastern map and Western map.

5060;Caesar in Alexandria;"Volume 9 of the &quot;Great Battles of History&quot; series.&#10;&#10;Caesar in Alexandria challenges the best GBoH players out there by allowing them to conduct both land and naval operations at the same time, in this simulation of Julius Caesar's rather rash pas de deux with the Egyptians in 47 BC. Caesar and the Romans - the VI, XXVII, and XXXVII legions, lots of archers and auxiliaries, and a dangerous contingent of field artillery - control the center of the city, including the Palace and the Inner Harbor. The Egyptians - a mixture of heavy, medium, and light infantry, and a numerically superior galley fleet - control the Outer Harbor, the rest of the city, and all land approaches to it.&#10; The Romans must defend their city position and also take control of the Heptastadium, the bridge that connects the city to the island of Pharos and its lighthouse, one of the Seven Wonders of the World.&#10; Caesar in Alexandria combines GBoH with War Galley: Naval Warfare in the Ancient World, with rules for both systems included. On land, the game is closer to Simple GBoH (which is not needed to play this), mostly because the form of warfare involved here: street-fighting. Caesar in Alexandria also uses the SGBoH command and activation system, which is what produces the large dose of tension. Do you move legions to protect your inner defense, or do you continue to attack the town of Pharos to gain access to the Heptastadium? Do you transport land troops to the island, or do you move your battle galleys out to sea, around Pharos, and into the Outer Harbor to attack the Egyptian fleet? Each turn you can do only one, all the while your opponent is considering his several, difficult options.&#10;&#10;Included are some small scenarios for quicker play.&#10;&#10;";2001;6.97026;3.0588;2;2;300;14;Ancient, Nautical, Wargame

5071;Sjoelen;"Sjoelen (Dutch) is also less commonly known as Dutch Shuffleboard (English) or Jakkolo (German).  This dexterity game is particularly popular in the Netherlands, where it originated, hence Sjoelen is the official designation for the game.  The World Championships are held every two years, with the most recent event in Germany (30 May-1 June, 2019), and the next event planned for Netherlands (2021).&#10;&#10;Playing involves each player having three rounds of sliding 30 wooden disks along a 2 metre long table in an attempt to get them through four arches numbered 1 to 4 at the other end. Getting disks into the low scoring compartments is just as important as the high ones because each set of 4 disks in the four compartments scores double (20 instead of 10 points).&#10;&#10;Note that sjoelbak is the name of the board, not the game itself.&#10;&#10;";1870;6.82046;1.1613;1;4;30;6;Action / Dexterity
5072;Carrom;"Carrom is most easily described as &quot;finger pool&quot;. On a 29&quot; x 29&quot; wooden board, players flick a large weighted disc (the striker) at smaller wooden discs (the carrom-men). The goal is to sink your 9 carrom-men (black or white), as well as the red Queen, in the four corner pockets. The first player or team to accomplish this collects points for the round (commonly called a &quot;board&quot;). A standard game of Carrom continues until one player has 25 points or 8 boards have been completed.&#10;&#10;Carrom is typically played with powder, and some variations of the game use cues.  The most widely played form of 'proper' Carrom is supported by a world wide set of rules known as The Laws of Carrom, and are available from the International Carrom Federation.&#10;&#10;Carrom bears similarities to Pool and Crokinole, but is a fascinating game in its own right with varied strategies and techniques. No one knows exactly where the game originated. It could have come from Bangladesh, Burma, Egypt, or Ethiopia, but most believe it originated in India.&#10;&#10;Also see American Carrom and the European games in a similar vein, Korona and H-ring spel.&#10;&#10;";0;7.09522;1.4621;2;4;60;6;Action / Dexterity

Once they have a set of any 2 cities in a county they can then build forts, which enables the fort owner to receive military units from other players who land on that city.&#10;&#10;The game appears to originate from New Zealand during the war years. It was promoted in local and National New Zealand papers from 1941 to about 1947. The rules were printed by the Evening Post which was a New Zealand Newspaper publisher company. The advertised examples suggest that small coloured moulded playing pieces were included, although other metal button type tokens have been recorded.

5076;Planet of the Apes;"Designed to cash in on the popular remake of the classic sci-fi movie Planet of the Apes, the object of this game is to collect a set of items which will allow you to be the first to escape the planet through a time portal.  The playing surface comprises 20 modular board units which are shuffled prior to play and therefore create a randomized labyrinth planet to be explored.  120 push-out cardboard tiles  represent hidden bonuses and hazards and three special dice decide the combat and range of movement. Exploration elements work well and ensure no two games are the same. Dressing the board with the rather fiddly little tiles each time a new part of the maze is uncovered can become tedious. The cumulative effect of collected weapons can render a lucky player almost invincible very quickly, with the chimp warriors soon becoming superfluous and little more than an irritation.&#10;&#10;A reasonable strategic exploration game for the younger player.&#10;&#10;";2001;5.43182;1.6667;2;6;45;8;Exploration, Maze, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Novel-based, Science Fiction
5077;Chaos;"The object of the game is to move your six playing pieces from one side of the board to the opposite side.  The game is played by either two or four players.  The catch is that the pieces all look identical; they are identified by a colored ring on their underside only.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you move a piece forward, sideways or diagonally, possibly jumping over a single piece (a series of jumps is possible if the right gaps are present, as in Checkers).  When a piece reaches the far side, it is turned over to reveal its true owner.  If yours, it stays there; if not, it reverts to its indistinguishable side and its true owner must move it on his next turn.  During play, you can also challenge the ownership of a piece being moved.  The incorrect player forfeits his turn.&#10;&#10;The german Schmidt Spiele edition was published as a game of the Schmidt Spiele-Bar series in book case format.&#10;&#10;";1970;5.78846;1.3333;2;4;20;8;Abstract Strategy, Memory

5079;Push;"The object of the game is to Push your Prince from its home position to one of the crowned squares on the opposite side of the board (the edge rows).  This is achieved with the help of your eight Escort pieces.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you move either your Prince (1, 2 or 3 steps) or an Escort (by its exact value: 3, 4, 5 or 6).  Each step is horizontal, diagonal or vertical --but the board is odd.  It is 33x33 with 64 3x3 tiles &quot;punched out&quot;, some with a connected square remaining in the middle.&#10;&#10;Jumps aren't allowed.  A Push occurs when an Escort arrives short of another piece (Princes can't Push); what happens is that the Escort's remaining steps are transferred to the pushed piece --which may be an opposing piece or your own Prince.  The pushed piece's move must be in a straight line, in the direction dictated by the collision.  When the straight line isn't possible, deflection occurs as indicated in the rules.  Compound pushes can occur, when a pushed piece in turn collides with another.&#10;&#10;";1979;5.5;0.0;2;2;20;12;Abstract Strategy

Each player sits at a long edge and starts with his nine frogs (hollow plastic figurines, 7 cm along their largest dimension) filling that row.  All frogs move like Chess knights.  Light moves first.  Capture is by landing on an opposing frog and is not mandatory.  The object of the game is to line up three frogs horizontally, vertically or diagonally in the Arena in such a way that the opponent cannot break it up (by capture) on his next move.  A draw occurs when both players are down to two frogs.&#10;&#10;In advanced play, a frog that captures gets to move again, sort of like in Checkers.

Four in a row scores two points.  Get the point?  Build your rows or block your opponents.  There's fun and strategy on every roll, and doubles are always WILD!&#10;&#10;The board is a grid, with the numbers 3-11 along each edge. Two blue dice determine which blue column, two red dice determine which red row, and you place your marble where they meet. Doubles are wild, so you can choose where to place your marble. If your opponent has a marble at that spot and it's not part of a three-in-a-row, you have a roll off, 3 dice and three chances, to see who can get the highest roll and claim that spot. Once a marble is part of a three-in-a-row it is locked in. Points are counted for a three-in-a-row in every direction; horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. The game ends when someone runs out of marbles, and everyone has a final turn.&#10;&#10;1999 Mensa Select&#10;&#10;";2001;6.03557;1.0;2;4;30;8;Abstract Strategy, Dice

5122;Charades;"A traditional parlor game for large or small groups, charades was once so popular as an after-dinner activity that it was known simply as &quot;The Game.&quot; Its recorded history dates back to 16th century France, and the name has become a catchphrase for many different pantomime games. Many boxed versions with suggestions and timers are available, and several TV shows have been made using the basic idea of the game.&#10;&#10;In most versions, one player silently acts out a title (book, movie, show, etc.), phrase or person and their team must guess it. The words can be from a commercially made list or just creatively made up by the players. Many signals and conventions have become traditional (see link below). The experience is usually humorous, whether you are strenuously flapping away like a buzzard - alternating with pretending to push a buzzer and lying dead on the floor - for several minutes while your team guesses everything but buzzard (&quot;bird!&quot; &quot;scavenger!&quot; &quot;bird of prey!!&quot; &quot;raptor?&quot;) or frantically struggling to think up clever clues. Many of the clues use the &quot;sounds like&quot; hint - pretending to sew for the word &quot;so,&quot; for example. The excitement and frustration of piecing together the clues and guessing is also a great part of the fun, of course, and the relief is immense for both the actor and the guessing team when the guess is finally (or miraculously suddenly) correct. The game usually produces much laughter in the group playing it - solving the riddles is only part of the experience.&#10;&#10;";1550;5.10037;1.1064;2;20;30;8;Deduction, Party Game

5128;The Beatles Flip Your Wig Game;"A marketing tie-in for The Beatles, the game consists of rolling a die to move your &quot;Beatle&quot; (John, Paul, George, or Ringo) to a new space which may instruct the player to draw one of two different types of cards, steal a card from one or more other players, or lose a card.&#10;&#10;Play continues until one player wins the game by collecting the four cards corresponding to the &quot;Beatle&quot; that they are playing.  i.e. John needs to collect a John picture card, a John signature card, a John's Guitar card, and a hit record card.&#10;&#10;";1964;3.75;1.6667;2;4;20;7;Music
5129;The Simpsons: LOSER Takes All!;"A Simpsons branded party game with a strong truth or dare flavor.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player with the lowest score at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Players select a Simpsons character for a pawn and place it on the board.  They are given $20 in fake money and 10 junk food tokens as well as the give character cards matching the pawn they selected.&#10;&#10;Players take turns using the spinner to decide actions and movement.  Moving into a new square triggers the action described on the square, in addition to any action the spinner dictated.&#10;&#10;Typical actions are giving away money or junk food tokens to other players, receiving money or junk food tokens from other players, and swapping money or junk food tokens with another player.&#10;&#10;Special actions are the question spaces on the board.  When a player lands on one they must read the next question on the current question card, write down their answer, and pick one of the other players to guess the written answer.  If they guess correctly, they turn one of their character cards face down; if they guess incorrectly, then the current player turns one of the his/her character cards face down.&#10;&#10;Some sample questions:&#10;&quot;True or False: I'd rather watch a horror movie than a sentimental drama.&quot;  &#10;&quot;What's my favorite movie?&quot;  &#10;&quot;Has a dog ever chased me?&quot;&#10;&#10;When one player has turned all five character cards face down, the game is over.  Players with face up character cards remaining must add three points per card to their point total (sum of junk food and money).  The player with the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;";2001;4.00008;1.3333;2;6;30;8;Movies / TV / Radio theme, Party Game
5130;Afrikan tähti;"Afrikan t&auml;hti (&quot;Star of Africa&quot;) is the most important Finnish board game ever. Designed in 1949 by then 19-year-old Kari Mannerla and published two years later in 1951, it has sold over 3.5 million copies since, half of them in Finland. There's one in almost every home in Finland.&#10;&#10;Players start in either Cairo or Tangier and start exploring Africa, trying to find gems. The main objective is to find the legendary giant diamond, Star of Africa. However, when flipping the tokens, players cannot know what they will find: nothing at all, some lesser gemstones or even a robber stealing their money and slowing their progress.&#10;&#10;When someone finds the Star of Africa, a race begins. The player with the diamond tries to deliver it back to Cairo or Tangier, other players try to find a horseshoe - a token discarded with no value before, now a key to victory. Winner is the player who reaches Cairo or Tangier first, carrying either the diamond or a horseshoe.&#10;&#10;A rules amendment, which prevents a player being stuck on an island and effectively out of the game, was only added in 2005.&#10;&#10;The first official expansion, Afrikan t&#195;&#164;hti: Retkikunnat, was published in 2014. This could be a record - a game being expanded for the first time, by the rights holder, 63 years after it was first published.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by: Inkan Aarre&#10;&#10;";1951;4.71613;1.0881;2;5;45;6;Children's Game, Exploration
5131;Love it or Hate it;"Party game where a category is chosen (random spin on any one of four disks).  Then all players write down something associated with that category and whether they love or hate it.  All slips of paper are put together with the authors unknown.

Best played in a planned group setting (think murder mystery party but with auras instead of alibis), players are encouraged to show up with a personal object concealed in a paper bag&mdash;perfect for spontaneous &ldquo;psychic readings&rdquo; and cosmic guesswork.&#10;&#10;As the game begins, players take turns moving along a board and drawing activity cards filled with pseudo-scientific exercises that test your clairvoyance, telepathy, or just your ability to bluff with confidence.

When the judge, the player chooses a category (many suggestions are printed on the board, but there is also a &quot;choose your own&quot; option).  Then, the judge takes five cards from the deck of letter cards (each contains a single letter--no duplicates).&#10;&#10;At that point, the judge turns over the first letter for all to see.  When someone thinks of an item within the chosen category which starts with the appropriate letter, they blurt it out.  As soon as the judge hears an answer to their liking (know thy judge), he slams the hammer down and awards the card to the person who shouted the answer.  That player moves forward on the movement track.  After five letters are completed, someone else is the judge.&#10;&#10;";2000;5.6;1.5;3;6;45;8;Party Game, Real-time, Trivia
5134;Peg Poker;"Yahtzee meets Poker meets Tic-Tac-Toe.&#10;&#10;The game board is a 4x4 grid and in each cell lies a record-keeping area noting eight possible poker hands and one hole for each card from 2 through ace.&#10;&#10;Players take turns rolling 13 6-sided dice to generate five-card poker hands (choose the best &quot;cards&quot;).  They also roll a randomizer die which tells them how many re-rolls they are allowed.  Once they're finished, they construct a hand (e.g. flush: 1-2-5-9-K) and mark one of the 16 tracking cells on the board with their color pegs.  They may also usurp someone else's claimed cell if their poker hand is of higher rank (hence the need to meticulously mark exact hands with the pegs).&#10;&#10;Once someone claims four cells in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal), they win. If a player cannot peg into a new cell because they can't beat a hand on the board, that player is eliminated.&#10;&#10;Games Magazine's Best New Family Game for 1994&#10;&#10;";1993;6.04625;1.3333;1;4;60;8;Dice

5136;Piraten-Abenteuer;"In Piraten-Abenteuer &ndash; previously published as Corsaro &ndash; players have been forced to take refuge near Adventure Island, and now they must work together to move all their boats to safety while trying to avoid the pirates who patrol the nearby waters. If a boat is captured by the pirates, the players have a chance to rescue the prisoners... at the cost of valuable time and supplies.&#10;&#10;This cooperative game is played on a board which shows the route from Adventure Island back to the player's home town. Each player starts with a boat on Adventure Island, and two pirate ships are placed along the route. The game is played in turns. Each turn, a player rolls two dice, then choses one die to use for his own boat and one die to use for one of the pirate ships. Both are moved as many places forward as the selected die shows. At certain points, the player can have his ship take a hidden route, which is not used by the pirate ships.&#10;&#10;If a pirate ship passes a boat, or if a boat passes a pirate ship, the boat is captured and placed on Pirates' Island. Other boats can free it if they manage to land on one of the rescue spaces on the track; the rescued boat is then returned to that same space.&#10;&#10;When all boats have reached the home town, the players have won the game. However, if some ships are captured while all other ships have reached the home town, the players lose.&#10;&#10;The difficulty level can be increased by giving each player two or three boats instead of one. The greatest challenge is the Grand Adventure, in which each player has three boats, there is a third pirate ship, and each player may hide on the hidden routes at most five turns during the game.&#10;&#10;The 2011 AMIGO edition is part of its &quot;&Ouml;kologisch + Kooperativ&quot; (Ecological &amp; Cooperative) line of games.&#10;&#10;";1991;6.24348;1.3333;2;4;20;4;Children's Game, Nautical, Pirates

5149;Bedlam;"Pit with a board.&#10;&#10;In this game, the objective is to move along your pawn's lane from one end of the board and back before anyone else does.  Along that path are 8 different pictures, repeated over and over, and each person's path is slightly different (at least the sequence of the images varies, but the same images are used).&#10;&#10;Each player also holds a hand of cards and their goal is to collect cards with the same images as the one their pawn is resting on.  That part of the game is pretty much the same as the classic game, Pit.  Players trade cards unseen, in any combinations (unlike Pit) and all that must happen is that an equal number of cards must be given and taken.&#10;&#10;When the timer runs out, move your pawn forward the number of spaces equal to the number of matching cards in your hand.  At that point, most of the time, you will be sitting on a different image, so another round of trading is necessary to redistribute your hand.&#10;&#10;";1995;5.74074;1.0;3;6;45;8;Negotiation, Real-time

You may be forced to pass if no placement is possible.&#10;&#10;Once all of your pieces are placed, you use the dice to move them (the transition turn may feature a placement and a move).  Here too the dice dictate the moves: a throw of one and two allows either one piece to move on board two, or two pieces on board one, or one piece from board two to board one (or vice-versa).  Moves are mandatory.&#10;&#10;As in Morris, every time a three-piece alignment is formed (including vertical ones), this is a Mill and one opposing piece of the miller's choice is removed.  Pieces in mills are protected.  Multiple mills may be formed by a single move.  You win by grinding the opponent down to two pieces.&#10;&#10;The four-player game is a partnership game.&#10;&#10;";1988;4.6;2.0;2;2;20;0;Abstract Strategy

5165;Code Breaker;"A fairly simple and quick deduction game.  Cards come in three types; Artists, Thinkers and Leaders, each with a picture and short biography of an appropriate historical character, and in two colors, red if born before 1700 and yellow if afterwards.   The Code Master chooses a pattern for cards to be laid down in incorporating color, type or both, either from the Code cards supplied or by inventing his own.  Players, including the Code Master, then take it in turns to play cards from their hands and are told whether the cards are correct or not.  If a player deduces the pattern before running out of cards he scores; otherwise the Code Master scores.&#10;&#10;Based, according to the rule leaflet, on a game by the same author called Eleusis published in 1963.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.52222;1.8;2;4;20;10;Card Game, Deduction
5166;Express Monopoly Card Game;"A different and simpler game from the Monopoly Card Game; this game comes in a double card sized pack with a jigsaw board.&#10;&#10;Play consists simply of playing cards from your hand to the board with the aim of being the player to complete a set or Monopoly, at which point you collect the cards in that set in your score pile.  There are special cards which allow you to steal cards sight unseen from other players.  Chance and Community Chest cards act as jokers.&#10;&#10;";1993;5.0672;1.1111;2;4;20;8;Card Game, Children's Game, Economic
5167;Rubik's Illusion;"A curious abstract strategy game.&#10;&#10;The box forms the board; 32 squares plus a mirror which fits at right angles to the board producing a total playing surface of 64 squares.  Each piece on the real side of the board has a reflection on the virtual side, which acts in all ways as a real piece. The pieces come in three types; red with red reflection, yellow with yellow reflection, and red with a yellow reflection (and vice versa, of course).&#10;&#10;On his turn a player can introduce a piece to the edge of the board, slide a piece of his colour or a dual piece or turn a dual piece 180 degrees.   The aim of the game is to produce a line of 5  (but no more) pieces of his colour in any direction.&#10;&#10;";1989;5.99227;1.7;2;2;30;0;Abstract Strategy
5168;Queen's Guard;"Queen's Guard, a.k.a. Agon, is played on a hexagonal board, comprised of 91 smaller hexagons, six to each side of the board. The central hex is known as the throne; most Agon boards feature alternating colors of hexes in rings, starting from the six hexes surrounding the throne. Each player has one queen piece and six guard pieces. These all have alternating starting positions on the board's outer ring. Players take turns moving their pieces forward (or laterally) towards the center of the board; pieces may be captured by an opponent, if they are surrounded on two sides in a straight line. The captured player must then relocate his piece to the outer ring of the board. To win the game, a player must have his queen on the throne and surrounded by all six of his guards.&#10;&#10;";1842;5.93437;2.3333;2;2;30;9;Abstract Strategy, Children's Game
5169;Quest for the Dragon;"This Sorcerer&#039;s Cave type adventure boardgame sees each player starting from a different corner of the board. Tiles are placed on the board as it is explored; initially each player is looking for the rooms containing their equipment (Key, allowing teleportation between various points, Weapon and Armour). On the way they encounter Monsters to defeat. Once they have found their equipment players make their way to the center of the board to challenge the Dragon; defeating him wins the game. Players can have combat with each other if they land on the same space and can barter items with each other.&#10;&#10;Success is dependent on your rooms turning up somewhere near you early on in the game. There is a limited amount of decision making re the routes and which is the best way to put tiles.&#10;&#10;The components are quite attractive and sturdy.&#10;&#10;The game comes with a Story Booklet and a leaflet explaining how the Invalay board system will be used in subsequent games; unfortunately this game, the company and the system all appear to have sunk without trace!&#10;&#10;";1987;7.13636;1.0;2;4;60;10;Adventure, Exploration, Fantasy
5170;Tri-Umph;"This game is distantly related to the Mill game or Nine Men's Morris, in that the object is to make alignments of three pieces: each such alignment created removes one opposing piece (miller's choice).  You win when you've reduced the opponent to two pieces or put him in such a bind that he cannot move.  If both players become immobilized, a draw occurs.&#10;&#10;The 5&times;6 board is set up by both players by plunking down each of their 12 pieces alternately.  Strategy is crucial during this phase.  The only restriction is that alignments of three cannot be formed during this phase.  Once all pieces are set up, on your turn you move one of your pieces one space horizontally or vertically (diagonals aren't allowed or considered).&#10;&#10;Strategies are alluded to but not explained in the short rules.  Shan Ruwa (&quot;to drown&quot;) consists of setting up so as to force the opponent to place in positions that will aid the starting player and drown the opponent.  Conversely, Turi (&quot;to push&quot;) prevents the starting player from forming alignments and makes his opening move bad for him.&#10;&#10;A mill is called here Doki (&quot;galloping horse&quot;).  It is a combination of five pieces such that you form an alignment on each leg of the back-and-forth motion of the fifth piece.  The game terms are all taken from Hausa, a West-African language (presumably the first author's maternal tongue).&#10;&#10;";1989;4.5;3.0;2;2;20;0;Abstract Strategy

5174;Lingua;"Very good variant of Scrabble. Scoring is easier and allows for tactics in trying to outscore your opponent. The game can be forced to an end by reaching the bonus end-fields.&#10;&#10;Lingua was also published in the Ravensburger Casino Series.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a 17x17 board, the squares being one of four colours or white. A &quot;Start&quot; square is near one corner and there are four &quot;finish&quot; squares in the opposite corner. There are 132 tiles each being in one of the four board colours and players each start with 12 of these and top up to 12 after their turn.&#10;&#10;The first player must play a legal word through the Start square and thereafter players must play a word that intersects orthogonally with at least one existing word in crossword fashion. Intersection may be achieved by playing a word that adds a letter at the beginning or end of an existing word except the adding of a plural &quot;S&quot; is not allowed.&#10;&#10;You score for every letter in the word(s) created. Basic scoring is by tile colour, blue=1, yellow=2, green=3 and red=4.&#10;However, if you play a tile that matches the board square tile you have made an ACE. Each ACE initially scores a bonus or 10 in addition to normal score. After a player has made ten ACES, future scores are doubled, after 15 ACES trebled etc.&#10;&#10;There is a bonus of 25 if you form a word with all the letters of the same colour (a Colourword).&#10;&#10;The games ends when a). Players can no longer form words, b). when a player can no longer top up to 12 or c). when a player plays a word that goes over one or more of the Finish squares where they will earn the finish square bonus(es).&#10;&#10;";1969;6.04222;2.0;2;4;60;10;Word Game

5177;Drakborgen Legenden;"The 2nd edition of the classic adventure game Drakborgen (DungeonQuest) from 1985. The players enter the unexplored Dragon's Keep in search for treasure. The Keep is home to a dragon, and it is up to the players, with luck and timing, to overcome the dangers, collect some treasure and escape from the Keep before the sun sets and the vampires go hunting.&#10;&#10;This edition features streamlined rules, for example pre-placed one-use event tiles (placed onto the room tiles) instead of the players drawing room cards each time they enter a room. Door cards, trap cards, search cards, corpse cards and chest cards have been rationalized; all is now contained on the room tiles. Undefeated monsters and certain traps now stay on the board, and the game features a slightly more complex and tactical fighting system. The game allows for co-operative play, and even the dragon herself can be killed.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    DungeonQuest&#10;&#10;&#10;";2002;5.93789;2.2381;2;4;90;0;Exploration, Fantasy, Maze

Good fun for adults too.&#10;&#10;Each trader has four camels, that they attempt to get through the desert to the market at Marrakesh. The market in Marrakesh has a lot of valuable items waiting and these provide the victory points for finding out the winner. Movement is controlled by drawing tiles from a bag. Tiles usually allow you to move your camel, but may have other effects such as Sandstorms, which change the board layout. Camels that arrive earlier at the market will be able to pick up the most valuable items. However, if you concentrate all your efforts to get one camel to market, you are likely to lose your back-markers to the sandstorms.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Up the River&#10;&#10;&#10;Ages 6 and up&#10;&#10;";2002;6.33342;1.2632;2;4;20;6;Children's Game, Racing

5209;Rondo;"Rondo is a German card game where players must construct words from drawn cards.&#10;&#10;Goal&#10;Earning the most points by constructing words from letter cards.&#10;&#10;Game play&#10;The 110 cards are shuffled. Most of them show a single letter and a point value, which is the higher the more rarely that letter is used in the German language. There are also joker cards (can be used as any letter), and delete cards (can cover up letters at the start or end of a word).&#10;Each player gets 7 cards.&#10;The expandable card holder, in which the letter cards are placed to form words, is set to three slots (maximum length is 9).&#10;To determine a start player, each player tries to form a three-letter word from his/her cards. The player whose word has the highest point value puts a three-letter word into the card holder, his/her points are written down and he/she refills his/her hand to 7. Players then take turns building words from their letter cards. Turn length is determined by a sand timer.&#10;&#10;Rules for building words:&#10;&#10;     A new word is constructed by putting cards over the previous word, or by adding an additional letter.&#10;     The new word must be at least three letters long.&#10;     The new word can be up to one letter longer than the previous word.&#10;     At least one letter from the previous word must be re-used.&#10;     Creating a new word by adding only a delete or joker card is a valid move.&#10;&#10;&#10;A player can exchange cards from his/her hand for cards from the draw deck at a cost of -2 points per card.&#10;If a player manages to create a new word before the timer runs out, he/she gets the corresponding points. Bonus points are given for using three or more new cards.&#10;A player who couldn't create a new word gets an additional card. At the end of his/her turn, a player always refills his/her hand to 7.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the draw deck has been exhausted and &#10;&#10;     a player has no cards left, or&#10;     all players have passed once.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players add up their points from all rounds. Remaining hand cards count negative points, according to their point value.&#10;The player with the highest total wins the game.&#10;&#10;";1997;5.1875;1.4286;2;6;45;12;Card Game, Party Game, Word Game

The 4-8 player range works best.&#10;&#10;One player (&quot;God&quot;, &quot;Nature&quot; or the &quot;Demiurge&quot;) thinks up a rule (a &quot;law of nature&quot;) that governs the correct play of the cards.  Usually, the rule only involves the most recently correctly-played card, but it can be more complex.&#10;&#10;The other players (&quot;Scientists&quot;) take turns playing cards (&quot;performing experiments&quot;) and race one another to see who can come up with a good hypothesis about the rule.  The first player to correctly deduce the rule scores big; God also scores based on how long it took for the players to figure the rule out.  God should not choose a rule that is so hard to find out that nobody does, because then he doesn't score.&#10;&#10;Additionally, a player with an hypothesis can declare himself to be a &quot;prophet&quot; who can predict the results of the other player's experiments.  Other players can then try to bring about the overthrow of the prophet by trying to find experiments whose results cannot be predicted (falsification), thus gaining a chance to become prophet themselves.&#10;&#10;A very simple rule would be &quot;Alternate between black and red cards&quot;.

Glory presents three American Civil War battles - First Manassas (1861), Second Manassas (1862) and the Battle of Chickamauga (1863) - as never before seen. The new game system combines sophistication with ease of accessibility: the rules are less than eight pages and there are practically no charts. The system combines mostly familiar mechanics with just enough new ones to add spice and challenge to comfortable familiarity.

5234;Sniggle!;"Not to be confused with the Sniggle game that is in the Sly set, this game is a race.&#10;&#10;A roll and move race game where you must get your 4 pawns, numbered 1 through 4, into the corresponding numbered spaces on the other side of the board. Each player tries to maneuver their four coloured pieces to their ending positions before the others. On your turn, you roll two dice and assign each die to a separate piece; doubles get you an extra turn. You can only move sideways and forward. If you get landed on by your opponent, your pawn gets sent back to the start. Spaces of your own color are safe, where you cannot be landed upon. First player to get all 4 of their pawns across the board wins. The endgame zone channels all pieces through a narrow passage, increasing the likelihood of mayhem.&#10;&#10;";1978;4.90366;1.1111;2;4;20;8;Children's Game, Racing, Transportation

5238;Championship Rodeo Circuit;"The object of the game is to become the World Champion Cowboy/Cowgirl (ie, the richest player).  This is achieved by traveling along the board and entering rodeos as they are reached.  Various mishaps can occur, such as hospital stays, and there are the expected expenses along the way.  Once you've garnered two trophies, you can enter the National Finals, at the end of the game track.  Once there, you enter events repeatedly, until the entire Finals purse is gone.  You must therefore decide whether to stop at every rodeo on the way to the Finals (which will garner money and trophies but leaves the Finals purse vulnerable to faster players) or charge there as quickly as possible (assuming the prerequisites have been achieved).&#10;&#10;The copyright indicates the game was revised in 1981 and 1987.&#10;&#10;";1976;6.0;0.0;2;6;60;8;American West

5241;Sinai: The Arab-Israeli Wars – '56, '67 and '73;"This game is a simulation of real-world events. It is played on a map that is a simplified terrain reproduction of the actual battlefield. A grid of hexagons printed over the map is used to regulate movement and position such as the squares on a chess board. The pieces in the game represent the actual military units that took part in the historical conflict. The large numbers on the pieces indicate the relative strength of these units. Each Player maneuvers his pieces on the map to engage those of the enemy. Battles take place when units are adjacent to enemy units. The total relative strengths of the involved units are compared. The attacking Player consults a simple probability table (the Combat Results Table) to determine the outcome of each battle. First one Player moves his units and conducts attacks, and then the other. The game proceeds this way (for a specified number of turns) as the Players try to achieve the historical objectives set forth in the rules. The final outcome of the game can be very different from the actual historical result. This gives Players a chance to &quot;change history.&quot; No prior knowledge of history or military tactics is required to play the game - just a little ingenuity and common sense.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the back of the box&#10;&#10;";1973;6.22093;2.6061;2;2;210;12;Modern Warfare, Wargame

The other half is split into three different mini games all built around the same key phrases.  Two involve trying to guess the popular word or phrase by either charades/drawing or talking about the phrase but not using any of the words in the actual question.&#10;&#10;The last part involves pure chance where a random event migh help or hinder the current player slightly.  Winning the round in these various activities will earn cards with an individual letter which eventually spells out &quot;D-E-R-I-V-A-T-I-O-N.&quot;&#10;&#10;The first player to do this wins the game.&#10;&#10;";2002;5.31034;1.6;4;10;60;0;Bluffing, Humor, Party Game, Word Game

Provide your own dice.&#10;&#10;Set in the Caribbean in the 17th century, the game can be played on two levels and in two ways, making four different games in all.  You can play it simply as a two-player ship-to-ship combat game, using either basic or advanced combat rules.  The advanced rules use a system reminiscent of Ace of Aces to track your opponent's sailing ship (and the wind) relative to your ship.  The basic game is much simpler, just keeping track of your hull points, guns, sails, and boarders.  (Boarding rules are similar to Battle Chips from Tim's Games.)&#10;&#10;The campaign game can be played by four players - more if you photocopy player mats and don't mind people doubling up on roles.  With four, each person takes one of four roles: pirate, British privateer, merchant, Spanish galleoneer.  Each has different goals to win the game.  There is a simple map of the Caribbean with six ports (some British, some Spanish, some neutral, some cities, some towns, some villages) and two different sea zones.  You simultaneously select your destinations and reveal (you can't go directly from port to port - you must first go to one of the sea zones).  If you're in the same area as another player, there may be combat - use either basic or advanced ship-to-ship combat as described above.  Once that's resolved, roll on the encounter tables, modifying the result depending on if a port is hostile or friendly or neutral to you.  After resolving events and encounters on the tables, you may trade if in port.&#10;&#10;Goals involve varying quantities booty, supplies, medals and legends.  Booty and supplies you can get through trading, booty and legends can be gotten through fighting, and medals can be bribed out of local governors.&#10;&#10;";0;4.6875;2.0;2;4;45;0;Nautical, Pirates, Transportation

The first player to complete the Temple and play Filling of the Holy of Holies is the winner. However, the game is not that simple. While you are trying to build the Temple, the Israelites continue to fall into Sin. Work must be stopped on the Temple in order to lead the Israelites back into the ways of the LORD. To make matters worse, invasion forces from Babylon are pouring down from the north. They want to destroy the entire city of Jerusalem and wreck the Temple! Do you have what it takes to handle the Israelites' rebellion against God, deal with the Babylonian attacks, and still find time to complete the Temple before your opponent does?&quot;&#10;&#10;Each of the two players takes the part of the Israelites attempting to complete the Temple while at the same time playing the part of the attacking Babylonians for his opponent. The goal of the game is to be the first player to complete the Temple in its entirety, including all Structure and Furnishing Cards, and finally play the Filling of the Holy of Holies card.&#10;&#10;The folding game board loosely depicts the Old City of Jerusalem. Positions for Structure, Priest, Altar, Prophet, other cards, and positions for the Babylonian army pawns are clearly marked.&#10;&#10;Each player has a deck of 100 cards from which he draws during the game. Drawing and laying cards are the driving force behind play. Cards are played to build the Temple structure, furnish the Temple, build an Altar, attack your opponent's Temple with Babylonian armies, destroy your opponent's armies, interfere with building using Sin, negating Sin with Burnt Offerings and Scapegoats, and so forth.&#10;&#10;A lengthy note from the designer explains much of the history and background of the game design and origin.&#10;&#10;";2001;4.17692;1.2;2;2;60;7;Ancient, Civilization, Fighting, Religious, Territory Building

5261;Jigsol;"From the designer:&#10;&#10;The firsts are born in bursts, and the best of the rest are obsessed.&quot; This is how I defined that illusive state, the 'open' or 'perfect' game, in 1976. Since perfection is all but impossible to achieve, I decided to design all-inclusive or 'peri-' games, Jigsol' is the first of the series.&#10;&#10;Designed to play with more versatility and challenge than any other word game, Jigsol' is ideal for any player who can spell 24 words or more.

The game ends when someone gets 5 or more deltas, or at 200, 500 or more points.&#10;&#10;";1985;4.63333;0.0;1;8;30;10;Word Game
5263;Hex-Meister;"The board shows a series of concentric hex-gridded spaces, of varying colors. The two white rings (&quot;lanes&quot;) allow movement limited only by the presence of other pieces. The three blue rings (&quot;moats&quot;) cannot be crossed in one go; you must stop on them. The lone exceptions are the four blue hexes on your side of the board --you may cross them freely, but your opponent cannot. The thirteen red hexes (&quot;gates&quot;), finally, are the game goals; you win by occupying five of these in a straight line. To enter a gate, you must start adjacent to it (except for the two gates adjacent to your base). Entering a gate (other than the two base ones) gives you a bonus move. Occupied gates are the only occupied spaces that can be jumped.&#10;&#10;A hex is &quot;secured&quot; (the opponent cannot enter it) if surrounded by three or more of your pieces. Securing a hex captures any piece that happens to lie there (it is removed from the game and you get a bonus move). Finally, the fifth gate of any triangular set is secured if you occupy the first four. This is called &quot;triangulation&quot;.&#10;&#10;The rulebook also supplies handicapping suggestions, optional rules for a more challenging game, and explains how to support team play.&#10;&#10;";1980;5.35417;2.0;2;2;30;10;Abstract Strategy
5264;Kanev: Parachutes Across the Dnepr, September 23-26, 1943;"Kanev: Parachutes Across the Dnepr, September 1943, is a war game that explores the confrontation between Soviet and German forces at the lower Dnieper river in September 1943, which featured the largest Soviet airborne offensive during World War 2.  Players assume command of either army and take turns to execute their orders for their forces.&#10;&#10;In this game, units exert a zone of control around them, forcing opposing units to maneuver around them to avoid being stopped in their tracks.  Engagements between units are resolved by consulting results of dice rolls modified by terrain, leadership, and other factors against charts.  Airborne assaults and air support are also part and parcel of the combat.  Keeping units in reserve is a strategical option, allowing players to immediately exploit breakthroughs and redeploy after battles.&#10;&#10;The game ends after a certain number of rounds.  The players total up their victory points (typically for occupying strategic locations with their units) and whoever has more is the winner.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 8 hours&#10;Hex: 1.67 km&#10;Unit: Company to Division&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 21&quot; X 32&quot; mapsheet&#10;One countersheet (200 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 12 page rules booklet&#10;&#10;";1981;6.52766;2.7778;2;2;360;12;Aviation / Flight, Wargame, World War II

5266;Scorpion;"Scorpion is an elegant variation on the Pachisi/Ludo style of race game.&#10;&#10;The board comprises a raised S-shaped track with baize-coated recesses for throwing the dice. The poker-chip sized pieces, embossed with scorpions, also stack neatly onto the impressively designed and attractive playing surface.&#10;&#10;The race starts with players entering their pieces onto the yellow track. After 18 spaces, when the end of the initial S has been reached, players double-back on themselves, taking the black track to return home. The twist lies in &#10;that a scorpion may &quot;sting&quot; another, not just by landing on the same space, but also by landing on an adjacent space on the other coloured track. This enables a player to hinder opponents or to boost his own position by switching scorpions onto the other track.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, the rather minimalist rules supplied do not cover every gameplay eventuality. In particular, the knock-on effect that occurs frequently on a congested board, where a &quot;stung&quot; scorpion may inadvertently sting another is not explained in a satisfactory manner.&#10;&#10;";1983;5.62368;2.3333;2;4;20;10;Racing
5267;Campaign;"This 1966 publication is a fairly simple roll and move contest to collect electoral votes. The center of the board has an outline map of the United States with the Electoral College votes of each state marked. The map divides the states into six color-coded regions.&#10;&#10;Players move around the edge of the board on a 64-square track. Most of these are individual states, and landing on one allows a player to take the state if uncommitted or to contest it if held by another player. To contest, he rolls 2D6, and on a 2-6 wins the state, while on 7-12 the challenged party gets to take a state in the same region from a challenger.&#10;&#10;There is a deck of Political Fortune cards which are collected on eight of the spaces. These can be positive or negative: losing a state or a turn or even all states in a region; or winning states and becoming a &quot;favorite son&quot; in a state, which confers unchallengeable ownership of that state for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;When a player collects the majority of the states in one of the six regions, he takes over all the electoral college votes for the region and all of those states are locked (can no longer be challenged). First player to 270 Electoral College votes wins.&#10;&#10;";1966;4.5;0.0;2;8;60;0;Educational, Political
5268;Shoot & Spell;"The game &quot;board&quot; is like a boxing ring, with a &quot;disc shooter&quot; in each corner, loaded with letter discs (52 discs, including a &quot;Qu&quot; disc and four wild discs).  The players decide on a word length, then game proceeds.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you shoot a letter disc into the ring if the number present so far is insufficient or if, after studying the letters, you can't think of a word.  First player to shout out a word captures the discs that spell the word.  Extra discs remain there and help in the next round.  You can challenge words if you think them illegal or incorrectly spelled.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all discs have been shot.  Most captured discs wins.&#10;&#10;";1989;0.0;0.0;2;4;20;0;Action / Dexterity, Word Game
5269;Take A Letter;"&quot;Collect, Swipe and Trade Until A Word Is Made!&quot;&#10;&#10;As you move around the edge of the board, you collect letters, usually two per turn. &#10;Your 3 'Word Play' goal cards specify the conditions of the word(s) you need to put together. For instance: a word of greater than 7 letters or a word starting with 'TH' or a word that uses the same vowel twice. Scores range from 10 points to 75 points with harder goals resulting in higher scores. One word may fulfill the conditions on 1, 2 or all 3 of your cards. You then place the word on the gameboard in a crossword grid similar to Scrabble. By covering certain spaces on the board you earn bonus points or take a letter from another player.

5270;Maestria;"A strange word game, where each player draws from a bag 39 tiles with geometric segments on them.  Simultaneously, both players try to arrange their tiles to make a word of four or more letters (most letters are 2x3 tiles, the &quot;I&quot; is 1x3, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;W&quot;and &quot;Y&quot; are 3x3).  First player to shout Stop! wins the round and scores.  The word may be contested.&#10;&#10;Note that a word with an &quot;I&quot; in it will score less, and conversely with &quot;M&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;W&quot; or &quot;Y&quot;.&#10;&#10;The players swap boards and shuffle the tiles of each board around, then play repeats.  On the second round, swap again but draw 6 more tiles.  Words must now be 5+ letters.  Repeat for a third round (six-letter words), drawing six tiles again, so there are six words scored total in a game.  The boards show bonuses that can be scored by making really long words.&#10;&#10;The rules show the exact patterns that make up each letter.

For the Allies, it is a desperate race against time - a struggle to clear the Germans from Normandy in preparation for the drive across France to the Rhine.

5282;Raise the Titanic;"The object of the game is to earn fame and fortune by exploring (plundering?) the sunken Titanic, raising it and recovering the ship's log.  You need to gather expeditions of crews, supplies and equipment and face many pitfalls.&#10;&#10;The game plays in two phases, before and after the ship is raised (more on this later).  In the first phase, you circle the outer board gathering your expeditions, and occasionally enter the two inner paths that actually lead to the ship.  This is where you plun...er, &quot;recover artifacts&quot; from the Titanic.  After the ship is raised, the game now becomes a race to the Home Port with the ship's log.  All players get an advance from the publisher and the race proceeds.  The player with the log rolls only one die to the others' two, and the log changes hands each time the player with the log is caught up with.&#10;&#10;Winner is the player with the most money from artifacts recovered, fame points garnered and the ship's log bonus.&#10;&#10;The board is centered on a plastic column with a spring inside; a large model of the Titanic rests on the spring, loaded down by the weighted artifacts.

5283;Penta Go;"The game is played by two players or two teams of two players and is a curious amalgam of Go and Monopoly.  The object is to eliminate the opponent's stones.  There is an outer circuit with roughly every other square being a &quot;castle property&quot;, the others bearing various instructions (Monopoly-style).  The inner board consists of 10x10 lines enclosing 81 squares, twenty of which are castles in five colored groups of four.&#10;&#10;You start with your Knight (pawn piece) on the Start space and a box of fifty stones (men).  The third box is the King's Treasury (bank).  On your turn you roll, advance the Knight accordingly, and then add a stone to the central board.  Stones are placed on intersections, as in Go, and mark possession of the territory surrounding the intersection.  Taxes and commands on the outer board are ignored until the Knight has completed two circuits.&#10;&#10;The outer board has spaces with named castles; when you land there, you pay the castle's owner a land use tax of two to seven stones, depending on the castle (the central one is worth more, for example).  You own a castle by encircling it (as closely as possible).  You control territory by encircling it.  You can also trace a line across the board, which then gives you control of the smaller of the two parts thus created.  Capture is as in Go: an encircled set of stones dies if it does not have any &quot;eyes&quot; --empty spaces inside it and the encircling enemy.&#10;&#10;Stones can be exchanged freely, so you could, for example, sell captured opponent stones back to him in exchange for treasury stones in order to pay a fine.  If you absolutely run out of stones, you can take some off the board.&#10;&#10;";1971;0.0;0.0;2;4;30;0;Abstract Strategy

5285;Pro Tennis;"Pro Tennis simulates tennis matches in the early 1980's, the era of Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe, Martina Navritolova and Chris Evert. Included are cards for 50 men and 50 women professionals. Each card has a column for &quot;Serve&quot;, &quot;Serve Return&quot;, &quot;Volley&quot; and &quot;Special&quot;. Play consists of rolling dice (two white dice, plus a red die that isn't added to the others but sometimes changes the outcome) and cross-indexing the number rolled with the proper column. The result will be a point for one of the players or an instruction to roll next in one of the other columns. Once in a while, a player gets to make a choice that varies a column's results, and random events, such as stomach cramps, broken rackets, arguments with the umpire and thunderstorms, are possible.&#10;&#10;To take an example, Connors is pitted against McEnroe. Connors has the serve. He rolls 1, 5 (white) and 3 (red). The dice roll is 15 (read the dice as digits, low roll first); the red is ignored unless it's a 5 or 6. A 15 in Connors' Serve column is &quot;I&quot;, which means that McEnroe can return the serve. He rolls 2, 2 (white) and 1 (red) - a 22, which yields a &quot;V&quot; in his Serve Return column. Connors must now roll against his Volley column. He gets 4, 6 (white) and 5 (red). Ordinarily, a 46 would be a point for him, but the red 5 allows McEnroe to make a clutch return. He rolls the white dice (only). A score equal to or less than his Clutch Value is a V result; anything higher loses the point. McEnroe's Clutch Rating is 33. He rolls a 3 and a 6 - not good enough, and Connors is ahead 15-love.&#10;&#10;Connors serves again: 4, 6 (white) and 5 (red). An ace for Connors; McEnroe doesn't even get a clutch return. 30-love.&#10;&#10;The next Connors serve: 2, 2 (white) and 2 (red). Triples generate a random event. (Many players think that random events are too common and limit their appearance to rolls of triple 1's.) Connors rolls the two white dice: 3, 4. He's gotten into an argument with the umpire (realism!) and draws a warning. If he argues again, he'll automatically lose a point.&#10;&#10;Back to serving: 1, 4 (white) and 2 (red). The result is &quot;I&quot;. McEnroe's return: 3, 4 (white) and 1 (red) - a &quot;V&quot;. Connors rolls 1, 2 (white) and 4 (red). A 12 on his Volley column is &quot;S&quot;, which means that he returned the shot but left his opponent in a good position. McEnroe can roll on the favorable &quot;Special&quot; column. Sure enough. He rolls 3, 5 (white) and 3 (red); a 35 on his Special column wins the point. 30-15.&#10;&#10;And so it goes.&#10;&#10;This not a game for anyone who wants to devise winning strategies. Rather, the players watch as the dice play. That is, however, the point of this kind of sports simulation: to project what would happen if real athletes competed in imaginary matches.&#10;&#10;The game also includes rules for doubles, mixed doubles and matches between men and women.&#10;&#10;";1983;4.55105;1.6842;1;1;30;10;Sports

5288;Paratrooper: ASL Module 2;"(from the back of the box and user's description:)&#10;&#10;PARATROOPER is the second module in the ASL series, which means it is not a complete game unto itself. Players will need boards 1-4 of SQUAD LEADER and the ASL rules to play all eight scenarios included herein. However, all other components necessary to play the game are enclosed-absolutely no other purchase is necessary.&#10;&#10;PARATROOPER has been specially designed as an Introductory Module for those SQUAD LEADER players contemplating a switch to ASL to provide an inexpensive medium for them to sample the rich delights of the ASL game system without requiring the purchase of the full Russian/German OB found only in the first ASL Module: BEYOND VALOR. Yet, the countermix in PARATROOPER serves as a supplement to the BEYOND VALOR components, rather than an unneeded duplication of those counters should the player decide to expand his ASL collection.&#10;&#10;Included are board 24, featuring a village in a valley, and two countersheets.&#10;&#10;Due to the special nature of the fighting that comprised the airborne invasion of Normandy, the eight scenarios emphasize infantry encounters with little in the way of vehicles, ordnance, OBA, or the more detailed rules which constitute the entire spectrum of ASL.&#10;&#10;This goes hand-in-hand with the introductory nature of PARATROOPER.&#10;PARATROOPER is not a complete game; ownership of ASL and boards 1-4 is required.&#10;&#10;Scenario list:&#10;11 Defiance on Hill 30&#10;12 Confusion Reigns&#10;13 Le Manoir&#10;14 Silence that Gun&#10;15 Trapped!&#10;16 No Better Spot to Die&#10;17 Lost Opportunities&#10;18 The Roadblock&#10;&#10;&#10;The second module for Advanced Squad Leader.

5290;Partisan: ASL Module 4;"(from MMP's website)&#10;&#10;This is PARTISAN! - the fourth ASL module.  The eight scenarios contained herein focus on historical World War II battle situations involving the Resistance forces of various countries vs. the German and Axis Minor troops occupying their lands.  PARTISAN! will challenge your abilities in basic infantry combat as you maneuver and fire your squads, leaders and supporting weapons in scenarios whose forces run the gamut from elite Germans to poorly equipped but highly-motivated freedom fighters, to low-grade occupation troops.  Experience - as only ASL can let you - the vicious, no-quarter ambushes, surprise raids and set-piece assaults that characterized guerilla warfare in the cities, forests and mountains of Europe.  Regardless of your preferences (including solitaire play), if you're an ASL infantry-grognard you're bound to find something pleasing in the wide assortment of PARTISAN! scenarios, which range from the large, high-piece-density type to the small, quick setup kind.  One is even &quot;three-dimensional&quot;, with most of the action occurring underground, using separate boards for the above and below-ground levels.&#10;&#10;PARTISAN!, along with its eight scenarios, contains one countersheet of Axis Minor infantry and support weapons - and also includes two boards: 10, with new, revised artwork; and 32, which features dense woods, a stream and a small cluster of buildings.

5293;G.I. Anvil of Victory: A Squad Leader Gamette;"It is December, 1941; Europe lays stricken beneath the Nazi boot. Only Britain, sheltered by her fleet and the English channel, stands fast before the swastika. To the East, German panzers stand stalled by winter at the very gates of Moscow. However, the Third Reich is nearing its high water mark for the tide is about to turn. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor will usher the United States into World War II and seal the doom of the Thou&shy;sand Year Reich. American industry will supply the Allied armies with vast quantities of war material, and a fresh, new breed of fighting man will enter the fray against Hitler's tested Wehrmacht. The G.I. will become the anvil on which the victory over a bled white Wehrmacht is forged.&#10;&#10;G.I.; ANVIL OF VICTORY allows you to command the full gamut of American fighting men as they drive the Germans from Africa, Sicily, Italy, Normandy, and back across the Rhine and into Germany itself. G.I. adds the complete American arsenal of fighting men and machines to your SQUAD LEADER repertoire, while expanding and enriching the most acclaimed historical gaming system yet devised. Can the greater numbers and superior, gunnery control systems of the American Shermans compensate for the more lethal guns of the feared German Panther? G.I. pro&shy;vides a gripping and graphic answer unmatched by any book.&#10;&#10;But G.I. offers far more than just American tanks. It contains more components than any of the preceding games in the series. The entire game system has been streamlined while enhancing realism even further.

The Union Army of the Tennessee is beginning to stir beneath the shadow of a small frontier church in western Tennessee.  The troops of U.S. &quot;Unconditional Surrender&quot; Grant wait only for their junction with Buell's Army of the Ohio to begin their long planned advance into the heartland of the Confederacy.&#10;&#10;Then suddenly the spring morning is shattered by the rattle of gunfire and the piercing rebel yell of over 40,000 charging Confederate soldiers.

Can you as U.S. Grant rally your forces and halt the rebel onslaught?  You'll never know until you've played Fury in the West'.&#10;&#10;Fury in the West is a realistic wargame played on an attractive five color 22 by 28 inch Mapboard with over 230 colorful extra-thick die-cut counters that accurately represent the opposing armies.

5295;Tactics (25th Anniversary Edition);"Tactics was released in 1983 as a 25th Anniversary Edition of the first commercial cardboard-counter wargame. The original Tactics was notable for being the game that inspired Charles S. Roberts to found wargame giant The Avalon Hill Game Co. Since Tactics was a particularly rare wargame, it was an especially appropriate candidate for an The Avalon Hill Game Co anniversary reprint.&#10;&#10;Tactics bore several similarities to both the original 1954 edition of Tactics and its 1958 redesign, Tactics II. The primary difference in the 25th Anniversary Edition was the unique mapboard layout. The map used in Tactics was said to have been based on an unpublished prototype that Charles S. Roberts had created for the original Tactics. In addition, the Anniversary Edition also included a colorful booklet which provided an illustrated overview of the first 25 years of The Avalon Hill Game Co.&#10;&#10;";1983;6.12195;2.4286;2;2;120;12;Modern Warfare, Wargame

5298;Curses!;"Each player starts the party game Curses! by drawing one Curse card and placing it face-up on the table. What? Curses? How can this be a party?! Ah, but these Curses are fun, not malicious, something along the lines of &quot;You can't bend your elbows&quot; or &quot;You must declare eternal love to anyone who rings the bell during this game&quot;.&#10;&#10;After that, each turn in Curses! the active player takes two actions in this order:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Draw a Challenge card. This card presents you with an action you must perform &ndash; a role to act out, a story to tell, an opinion to explain.&#10;    Draw a Curse card and give it to another player. &quot;You, bark like a dog whenever the player on your right reads a card!&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;So where's the game? You must obey the Curses placed upon you at all times &ndash; and if someone notices that you're not barking or declaring eternal love or doing whatever else it is you're supposed to be doing, then that player rings the central bell and reveals you for a louse and a nogoodnik. As a penalty, you must turn the Curse card you violated face down. And while you might think that lifting a Curse is good, break three Curses and you're out of the game. Eventually only one person will remain, and this Curse-loving looney wins the game!&#10;&#10;";2001;5.63278;1.1212;3;6;25;12;Action / Dexterity, Card Game, Humor, Party Game

If a &quot;hit ball&quot; results, then another die roll comparison is made between the batter/runner and the fielder the ball is hit to.&#10;&#10;In some cases, a play will be resolved after consulting a card that also describes an event in 19th century baseball.&#10;&#10;The components are of high quality.&#10;&#10;";1994;5.02308;1.5;2;2;30;0;Sports

5316;Warhammer Epic 40,000;"Warhammer Epic 40,000 was the third edition of the Epic system. The first edition and second editions of the Epic system had each been released as two separate games. The first edition comprised Space Marine (1st ed) and Adeptus Titanicus. Second edition comprised Space Marine (2nd ed) and Titan Legions. For the 3rd edition of the Epic system GW decided to release it as a single game and that game was Warhammer Epic 40k. For this reason Epic 40K is also known as 3rd ed. Epic 40k absorbed both the Titan Legions and Space Marine rules into one system, reducing and streamlining the rules in both those games into one more concise and coherent system. Epic now has faster gameplay and less rulebook-reading during play.&#10;&#10;It's a miniature tabletop battle game set in the Warhammer 40,000 (Third Edition) world using 6-10mm scale miniatures to simulate huge epic battles. The rules are fairly simple but very effective and allow for a lot of strategic ideas. While many old-school fans of the 1st and 2nd edition felt the 3rd edition of the game lost too much distinction between units with the simplification, to this day Jervis Johnson says this is the game he is most proud of and it has a very smooth playing style.&#10;&#10;Expansions:&#10;&#10;    Adeptus Titanicus II&#10;&#10;&#10;Reimplemented By&#10;&#10;    Epic Armageddon&#10;&#10;&#10;";1997;6.65611;3.193;2;4;180;0;Miniatures, Science Fiction

5321;The Battle of the Little Big Horn;"The Sioux and Cheyenne Indians were increasingly hostile to the prospectors pouring across North and South Dakota. Chief Sitting Bull gathered a force, by the Little Big Horn river, just north of the Montana-Wyoming border, ready to strike. Three columns of US Cavalry were dispatched to subdue the Indians.&#10;&#10;Now you can re-live this historic battle, and you can plan your own strategy. Can you find a way to get Custer, or at least his flag, clear of the battlefield?&#10;&#10;This game is based on the well known battle of Little Big Horn, where some united Native Americans won against General Custer's 7th cavalry. A simple game combining luck and strategy with different mechanics for different units.&#10;&#10;Movements and terrain effects are similar to wargames. Horses move faster than foot units and wearing a gun enables some ranged attacks.&#10;&#10;Winning conditions are different for the 2 opponents: Custer's men can either eliminate all Native American riders or cross the Little Big Horn River and try to reach one of 2 winning spaces on the board, the Native Americans must eliminate general Custer and his 2 officers.&#10;&#10;It was published by Rojas y Malaret in Spain, as the 3rd game in the GBM series at the end of 1952. The game was licenced and published by Hausser (Germany) in 1963.

5335;The Horse Soldiers: Forrest at Bay;"Horse Soldiers: Forrest at Bay (1988) is part of the Great Battles of the American Civil War series (GBACW).&#10;&#10;Included are two color map sheets and one sheet of 200 two-sided, die-cut counters and a 2nd half-sheet with 100 die-cut counters. These components represent the participants and locations of two ACW Confederate Cavalry engagements that involved the southern raider, General Nathan Bedford Forrest. The two battles, Brice's Crossroads and Tupelo, resulted from U.S. General William T. Sherman's campaign to remove Forrest as a threat to his flank and supply lines. Before the Union Army marched on Atlanta, Elements of Sherman's Army pursued Forrest, and others, into Mississippi and engaged his cavalry twice before its destruction at Tupelo.&#10;&#10;All game-turns represent approximately 1 hour real time, and each Strength Point is the equivalent of 50 men or 1 gun. In Brice's Crossroads, the map scale is 115 yards per hex. In Tupelo the scale is 160 yards per hex.&#10;&#10;This game is an excellent example of the, ever evolving, TSS/GBACW game system. New rules for Cavalry and a modified sequence of play are just couple of the many refinements. I've always wanted to adapt these refinements to the earlier TSS Cavalry game Rebel Sabers: Civil War Cavalry Battles by SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.). The game components are on par with any game in the system.&#10;&#10;It was included in Issue #119 0f Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine).&#10;&#10;";1988;6.16322;2.9375;2;2;120;12;American Civil War, Wargame

5346;Skittle-Bowl;"Based on the ancient game of Alley Skittles or Nine Pins -- whose American descendant is Bowling -- this game was transformed into a table-top game in the 1700's so that no throwing alley or bowling lane was needed.  The nine pins stood on a table and players took turns swinging a ball on the end of a chain so that it swung away from the playing field and then knocked down the pins on its return.&#10;&#10;Since this version could be played indoors and yet saved on pub space, it has been known as Bar Skittles.  When in 1783, dragoons put down a riot (caused by a dramatic play insulting to tailors), newspapers described the dragoons as a ball going through skittles, causing the game to become known as 'Devil Amongst the Tailors'.&#10;&#10;Revived as a family board game in 20th century United States, children were thought to get the hang of table-top skittles quickly and end up better than adults.

The region just below North Vietnam, Quang Tri province, was especially vulnerable to threats from the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and across the Laotian border. For almost a year the US Marines had been fighting to stabilize the DMZ region.&#10;&#10;Khe Sanh was the outpost intended to block and seal off the NVA's access to Quang Tri from the west (Laos), where many of the NVA's base areas were located. Other fortifications barred the DMZ. In early 1968, the NVA countered by assembling large forces around Khe Sanh, threatening a battle for the place. The American command focused its attention upon Quang Tri, and even more, Khe Sanh. The ensuing campaign pitted South Vietnamese and American forces, at the peak of their combat efficiency, against a tough NVA enemy. At stake was victory in the Vietnam War.&#10;&#10;Khe Sanh, 1968 game&#10;&#10;    Full color 22&quot;x34&quot; map&#10;    200 full color die cut counters&#10;    Rulebook length - 16 pages&#10;&#10;&#10;Complexity - Medium&#10;Solitaire Suitability - Low&#10;&#10;";2002;6.26786;2.8571;2;2;360;12;Modern Warfare, Vietnam War, Wargame

First Panzer Army had been cut-off by a total of nine Soviet armies. Its breakout began on March 25, 1944, and continued into early April. In these two weeks, the Germans continuously conducted a mobile defense as their pocket drove westward in an effort to meet a relief force (which was spearheaded by the II SS Panzer Corps) attacking eastward. Supplied by air much of the time, First Panzer Army deceived the Soviet forces by moving west, instead of south as the Soviet generals had anticipated. The pocket crossed several swollen rivers, and struggled through thick mud and deep snow, yet somehow remained intact. Unlike the Korsun Pocket disaster the month before, this time the Germans avoided yet another debacle. The commander of the First Panzer Army, Generaloberst Hans Hube, through his skillful leadership, proved to be a master of mobile defensive warfare.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn One day turns&#10;Hex: 5.5Km&#10;Units: Battalions to Divisions&#10;&#10;Complexity - Medium&#10;Solitaire Suitability - Medium&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;One Full color 22&quot;x34&quot; map&#10;Two Counter sheets (360 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 24 page rulebook&#10;Two Air Sector Charts&#10;One six-sided die&#10;&#10;";1992;5.58545;2.9167;2;2;480;12;Wargame, World War II

All variations involve placing 40 (*) plastic tiles of different colors (red, blue, green, yellow) and different shapes (circle, square, triangle, hexagon, trapezoid) in their proper positions on the gameboard. Some variants involve using two specialized dice (1 color die, 1 shape die).&#10;&#10;The game has quality components and is designed to encourage children to compare and arrange, and to practice manual dexterity and logical thinking.&#10;&#10;(*) Note that older editions had plastic tiles in 5 colors and 5 shapes. The fifth color was Orange, thus there were 5*5*2=50 tiles.

5355;BattleBots: Build' Em Bash 'Em;"Based on the TV series with the fighting robots, this is a two-stage game. You start with a chassis that also includes a basic weapon.&#10;&#10;In the first part of the game, you bid on robot bodies, armor, and upgraded weapons. Each player has a hand of cards that are numbered from 0 to 3, plus a &quot;Battle&quot; card. To get a body, you play a &quot;war&quot;-like card game, blindly drawing one of your cards. The player with the highest card gets to choose from the four bodies available. The loser chooses from what is remaining. Next, the players bid for accessories, the armor and weapons. The loser of the body choice gets to choose the first accessory up for bid. Each robot has a specific set of armor that will fit it. If you lose the bid on it, you are at a severe disadvantage. However, your opponent will have had to use up bid cards and thus will have less for later auctions. You also can prevent your opponent from completing his robot by playing your &quot;Battle&quot; card in an auction. This gives the item up for bid to your opponent, but ends all bidding for accessories and sends you to the next stage of the game.&#10;&#10;Once you have a robot and accessories for it, it is time to battle in the arena. You build your robot on a plastic arm that has a wheel control and trigger on the other side. Robots face off on any flat surface. Battles have a Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots robots feel, as the goal is to maneuver your robot where it can knock off your opponent's armor and expose a release button. Hit the release button and the opponent's robot pops off and you win the round. the first player to win four rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;";2002;4.875;0.0;2;2;20;8;Action / Dexterity, Movies / TV / Radio theme
5356;Nimbali;"Nimbali is set in the African bush. The game board shows four watering holes, each of which is assigned to a player. Each watering hole is filled with 9 blue wooden  raindrops.  Five animals (giraffe, cheetah, lion, zebra, and rhino) are placed on the board at the various watering holes. Players throw a single oversized die to determine the action of each move: five of the die faces depict the five animal hide patterns of the animal figures, and the sixth die face shows a blue raindrop. When the player's roll brings up one of the fur patterns, the player moves the corresponding animal clockwise around the board to the next watering hole. When the die roll shows the raindrop symbol, all players remove one raindrop from his watering hole for every animal that is standing at that player's watering hole at that time.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player who feeds the most thirsty animals by being the first to run out of raindrops.&#10;&#10;";2001;5.0;1.0;2;4;10;5;Animals, Children's Game, Dice, Educational, Environmental
5357;Von Manstein's Backhand Blow;"Southern Russia, early February 1943 -- In Stalingrad, the surrounded remnants of the once might German Sixth Army are being slowly and methodically exterminated. Hundreds of miles to the west, two powerful Soviet Fronts are moving west and south against a patchwork German line, intent on destroying the remaining Axis forces in Southern Russia. Operations Star and Gallop have begun.&#10;&#10;Six weeks later, the shocked, battered remnants of these two Soviet Fronts are running for the collective lives from powerful German panzer spearheads. What had happened? Soviet overconfidence was responsible in part for the disaster, playing into German hands, but by far, most of the credit for the amazing reversal belonged to Field Marshal von Manstein. Holding off the Soviets to his front and Hitler at his back, he managed to accumulate sufficient panzer formations to allow the Germans to regain tactical and operational superiority.&#10;&#10;Von Manstein's Backhand Blow is a low/intermediate complexity two player game using the well-received Turning the Tables system pioneered in earlier east front games produced by Moments in History. The game system itself is easy to learn and master. No two games will ever play out alike because a great deal of uncertainty and randomness is injected into each combat due to the Combat Chit Draw and Random Events Table. This uncertainty makes Von Manstein's Backhand Blow ideal as a solitaire game since combat results cannot be accurately predicted.&#10;&#10;Dirk Blennemann, the designer, has the reputation for creating excellent Orders of Battle for East Front simulations. Using detailed Russian and German language sources, he provides a broad array of maneuver units - Soviet division and corps on one side, and German units ranging from regiments down to the multitude of ad hoc German kampfgruppen thrown into the battle to stop the Soviet advance.&#10;&#10;Game Features:&#10;TIME SCALE     2 days per turn&#10;MAP SCALE     8km per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE     Soviet corps and divisions; German regiments, kampgruppen, and battalion-sized&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS     One or two&#10;&#10;(from GMT website)&#10;&#10;";2002;7.26669;3.125;1;2;0;0;Wargame, World War II

It is an Empires of History game, which utilizes a D10 variant of the Axis & Allies gaming system. The Arab Israeli Wars includes 2 game scenarios; one for the 1967 War and one for the 1973 War.&#10; In the 1967 war, Israel must strike out quickly to wrestle the Sinai region away from Egypt and deal deadly blows against Syria and Jordan before the weight of the superior Arab numbers can fully be mobilized, and before Iraq joins in the war against them. Israel's ready reserves gives them an edge in calling up their armies and they have to leverage that for everything it is worth.&#10;&#10;In the 1973 war, Israel begins play in control of the Sinai, Palestine, and the Golan Heights. The Arab powers must hit Israel hard and fast, trying to overrun Israel's border armies before Israel can mobilize its then-superior military might.&#10;&#10;The Arab Israeli Wars is a fast paced game (some games can be concluded in as little as a hour) historically portraying these two middle east conflicts.

The first edition was published in 1991, with a much more clearly written second edition being published in 2002. The game consists of a single rulebook.&#10;&#10;The player's miniatures are organized onto stands or 'elements', an army consisting of about 10-14 such elements. Troop types range from powerful Heroes, Magicians, and Dragons, through such things as Blades, Riders, and Spears and down to the humble Hordes of the game title.&#10;&#10;Movement is alternate, with each player dicing for action points (PIPs) which allow them to move single elements or groups of elements, deploy certain element types and use magicians to be-spell enemy troops. Combat between elements is resolved by each player rolling a die and adding the element's combat factor. Highest score wins, with some elements automatically destroying others and most others being destroyed if their final score is half, or less, than that of the opponent.&#10;&#10;The strength of the game is that there are no 'fixed' armies. With only a few restrictions (concerned with which elements can be generals and the proportion of 'powerful' troop types) you can construct your army any way you wish. This means you can create armies to represent those from any work of fantasy fiction, myth, legend, film, TV, anything else that your imagination desires. A large number of example army lists, from a variety of sources, are included in the rules book.&#10;&#10;";1991;7.39156;2.4737;2;6;45;12;Fantasy, Miniatures, Wargame

The players start with a portfolio of blue chips, gold, oil, and treasury bonds worth $1,000,000.  Players can buy and sell shares by landing on Market Mover spaces on the gameboard.  Every time someone lands on a Market Mover space, they roll two dice, find the corresponding card, and the share prices all change.  Players get one wild card at the beginning of the game, which can be used to change the market whenever they want according to the card.  Share prices over time are kept track of on a nifty wipe-off board.&#10;&#10;The game comes with both play money and shares and with trading worksheets, and players can use one, the other, or both.&#10;&#10;";1989;6.0;0.0;2;4;60;12;Economic
5386;Maneuver;"Maneuver: The scheming game of getting it all together!&#10;&#10;This game was recommended by GAMES way back in 1979. Two to four players each choose a set of colored marbles which are placed on the board and then shaken up with an opaque lid on top. The board is configured unevenly so that it forms a diagonal grid where the marbles can nestle. There's a great deal of luck involved since marbles may land favorably for some players and not others.&#10;&#10;The object is simply to move your marbles one spot at a time in any diagonal direction to arrange your twelve marbles into lines of three or more, while blocking your opponents in the process.&#10;&#10;";1979;6.5;0.0;2;4;20;8;Abstract Strategy
5387;Shakin' Sorry;"Shakin' Sorry is a game for 2 to 4 players ages 6 and up.&#10;&#10;It is a fast-paced, easy-to-learn, dice version of Sorry!.  The game comes with 17 dice.  16 have the standard Sorry! colors - blue, yellow, red, and green - on 1 side each, with the other 2 sides remaining blank.  The last die is blue.  One side says Slide, another says Sorry, and the remaining sides are blank.  Each player starts with four dice in the Start section of their game board.  On their turn, a player puts all of the dice in their start section, along with the Sorry die, into the die cup and rolls.  Any dice that land with their color face up they put into their Home section.  Dice that land with the color of other players face up get put into their Start sections.  Blank dice return to the roller's Start section.  If the player rolls &quot;Sorry&quot; on the Sorry die, they steal a die from someone else's Home and put it in their own Start.  If they roll Slide, they have to take a die from their own Home and put it in the Start of the player to their left.

5388;Golf Ace;"Golf Ace strives to simulate the intricacies of golf in a card game.&#10;&#10;It comprises four boards, depicting golf holes of various lengths and bearing different hazards, two packs of (conventional) playing cards and comprehensive playing instructions including example holes for the novice to play through.   Each hole has a dominant suit (hearts, clubs, diamonds or spades) and a stroke is made by playing a combination of cards to determine the distance and lie.  Thus playing a 2 + King (picture cards count as 0 or 10) + Ace, equates to a drive of 201 yards. Only certain distances are permitted, as shown on a distance table on each board, and certain cards may land you in a hazard (which, tactically, may still be worth playing).  Playing a card not of the dominant suit incurs a one stroke penalty.  A player may opt to draw from the stock, in the hope of improving his position, or play a stroke with the cards he has been dealt.&#10;&#10;Golf Ace works best with 4 players, but can be played as a solitaire, trying to beat your own lowest score for a round of 9 or 18 holes.&#10;&#10;";1992;4.2;0.0;1;4;30;8;Card Game, Sports

This is very tricky to do because when you place a marble on one tomahawk, the weight of the marble pushes that tomahawk down while pushing the opposite tomahawk up and there are openings along the edges of the chutes which allow some marbles to fall back out.&#10;&#10;This game requires some weight distribution reasoning and deduction and it is not as simple as it looks.&#10;&#10;";1973;6.24;2.0;2;4;20;6;Action / Dexterity, Deduction

The game of stock taking and deal making.&#10;&#10;&quot;WHEEDLE&reg; is the freewheeling stock trading game where 4-6 players jockey for corporate control. In a flurry of no-holds-barred trading, only the craftiest players will survive. . . Break out WHEEDLE and rise to the top!&quot;&#10;&#10;This game is Reiner Knizia's take on Pit. It consists of simultaneous trading of various stocks, trying to get a majority.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: A card is placed facedown in the center, and the remainder of the deck is dealt out. When the central card is flipped over, players begin calling out what they're collecting or wanting to trade away: &quot;Anyone have N Securities?&quot; (or, more, likely, &quot;I've got yellow, who wants yellow?&quot;) You can trade with anyone, any number of cards, including unequal trades. You may also swap one of your cards with the central card. When a player obtains a majority of all the stock types they have in their hand (for example, 4 of the 7 green cards and 3 of the 5 blue cards), play stops and the round is scored.&#10;&#10;Scoring: The player who stops the play gets +5 (or -5 if they don't have a majority after all). You get +2 for each stock card if you have a monopoly of that stock, and +1 per card if you have a majority but not all of them. Warning: You get -1 for each card in your hand that matches whichever stock is the central (bankrupt) card when the round ends. You get 0 points for any card that is not part of either a majority or the bankrupt company. After each player has dealt once, the game is over and whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;";2002;6.22238;1.1961;4;6;30;9;Animals, Card Game, Real-time

5406;New England;"A bidding and tile laying game with a theme of settling 17th Century New England. Each player represents a family that buys up and develops large tracts of land. The area of settlement is 98 squares (9 x 11, with one square missing). Each family starts with a double-sized tile of each of the three land types - settlement, cropland, pasture. Tiles have undeveloped and developed sides; naturally, they start undeveloped.&#10;&#10;In each round after the initial placement of the starting tiles, players bid for the right to buy more land tiles or development cards - up to two per round. A total of 9 combined tiles and cards are available each round for purchase. The advantage of bidding high (and thus paying more for each purchase) is that high bidders get the first choice, and the highest bidder gets to decide how many tiles and cards will be up for auction in the next round. Tiles or cards must be played immediately after purchase, unless barns are available to store cards (but not tiles) for later use. Those that can't be played may not be bought.&#10;&#10;Development cards are of two kinds. One lets a player buy pilgrims (who generate shillings, the game's currency), barns (to store development cards) or ships (to add extra tiles or cards to those on offer). The other is needed to develop land tiles. Development is possible only if the player owns undeveloped tiles of the same type, number and configuration as shown on the card, e. g., three cropland tiles forming a right angle, two adjacent pastures or a square of four settlements.&#10;&#10;Playing development cards earns victory points, the number depending on the difficulty of using the card. A square of tiles scores 10 points, while a pilgrim, barn or ship gains only one.&#10;&#10;Play continues until there are too few cards and tiles left to stock a full auction. At that point, the players tally their victory points, adding bonuses for most pilgrims, barns or ships. The winner is the player with the most points; shillings are the tie breaker.&#10;&#10;";2003;6.46678;2.4635;3;4;90;12;Economic, Territory Building

5411;Die Schatzinsel;"The Treasure Island landscape tiles are placed and treasures are taken in this pirate-themed game.&#10;&#10;Place the board in the middle of the table. Each player gets a sight barrier which he places before himself. Also the players get a landing craft. The landing craft is placed on the scoring track.&#10;&#10;The map tiles are mixed face-down, and an arbitrary card is put face-up on an arbitrary field of the game board. The card is oriented so that the two numbers each point to one of the sides of the board with the holes. Based on this tile, the coordinate stones are populated onto each side. First place the number corresponding to the tile, then fill in the rest of the side using numbers one through five consecutively. Players put their treasure chests, map tiles and guards behind their sight screen.&#10;&#10;Each player has one of the following possibilities during his turn:&#10;- Take an open map tile and place it behind their screen;&#10;- Take a free guard and place it behind their screen;&#10;- Place a map tile or tiles on the board;&#10;- Place Treasure Chests on the board;&#10;- Place Guards on the board.&#10;&#10;If a player scores he or she moves the corresponding landing craft on the scoring track. Players achieve points by placing map tiles, revealing buried treasures, guarding the treasure once discovered, and for ending the game. The game ends when a player has nothing behind their screen at the beginning of their turn.&#10;The winner is the player whose landing craft at the end of the game is furthest advanced on the score chart.&#10;&#10;";2002;6.01842;2.2;2;4;30;10;Exploration, Industry / Manufacturing, Nautical, Novel-based, Pirates

5413;Speedway Challenge;"Speedway Challenge is a quick playing card game based on motorcycle speedway.&#10;&#10;Races feature 4 riders, with rules for 2/3/4 players determining hand size and whether you control one or two riders each - how many races you play is up to you.&#10;&#10;A race consists of 5 rounds, with players playing one card per round for each of their riders.  The concept being that the track has 3 lanes (the white line, middle, and round the boards), with bikes only able to play cards in either unblocked lanes, or with a value lower than a bike already occupying a lane that turn.  Since the leading bike gets first play the next turn, there is plenty of opportunity for blocking and jockeying for position before the end of the final lap.&#10;&#10;Added to this are the chance of falls, injuries, start line infringements or even mechanical failures, to give a wide variety of race outcomes.&#10;&#10;";1990;6.90833;1.6667;2;4;30;8;Card Game, Racing, Sports

It can be played by itself as a stand alone game using our quick space and ground combat resolution system with the included source materials or used with more complex tactical combat systems with source materials that you already own.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Victory by Any Means: Campaign Moderator's Companion&#10;    Victory by Any Means: Jovian Chronicles&#10;    Victory by Any Means: The Starmada Edition&#10;    Stars Divided: Terran Civil War (Victory by Any Means: The Starmada Edition also required)&#10;    Victory by Any Means Source: Wars of the Kuissians and Boltians&#10;    Victory by Any Means: The Menagerie&#10;&#10;&#10;";2004;7.64103;3.8571;2;99;300;0;Civilization, Exploration, Negotiation, Science Fiction, Space Exploration, Territory Building, Wargame
5419;Magna Grecia;"From spielbox-online.de, translated via altavista babel fish (with a lot of manual tweaks):&#10;&#10;Magna Grecia (The cradle of the civilization) is the main attraction of the year with Clementoni. The game is a joint work of Leo Colovini and Michael Schacht.&#10;&#10;The southern region of Italy was called Magna Grecia and was settled 2,500 years ago by Greek merchants and adventurers. Before the arrival of the Greeks, the country was inhabited by only a few small tribes. Fruitful soil, navigable rivers, large forests, and bronze and silver mines offered enormous development possibilities. Larger cities developed, such as Tarantum, Syracuse, Katane, Locri, and Naxos. In addition, there were numerous villages of which no trace remains. A local road system promoted trade, and rich markets developed in the cities. More and more rivalries between the cities arose, particularly over control of the Oracle, which represented an important source for fame and wealth.&#10;&#10;Sufficient material for an evening of play. Each player must successfully settle and develop Magna Grecia. At favorable points, markets are built, villages are developed into cities and interconnected by a road system. Only thus may the interior be opened and the Oracle controlled. Constructing your own large city is often very expensive, and it is sometimes worthwhile to build instead in the neutral villages or opponents' cities.&#10;&#10;The board is covered with a hexagon grid on which pieces of road, towns, or markets are placed. A game is 12 rounds long. Each round is determined by an action map, which is set up at the beginning of play according to a certain pattern. The map specifies the player sequence and indicates to which extent the three basic actions (road construction, city building, and supply) may be used. There are also, of course, certain building rules to be considered. Additionally, markets can be established, the value of which depends on the number of connected locations. The Oracle is shown on the board. In order to control the Oracle, a player must connect one of his own cities to it by road. But if several cities are connected to an Oracle, the most important city takes precedence, determined by the number of locations connected to the city (not including Oracles).&#10;&#10;Markets and the Oracle determine when the game ends.&#10;&#10;";2003;6.60999;2.9485;2;4;75;12;Ancient, Territory Building
5420;Assassin: The Final Game;"The object of the game is to arrange the assassination of all opposing players and thereby take control of world traffic &#10;in illegally obtained commodities (drugs, plutonium, munitions, oil, secrets, diamonds and gold).&#10;&#10;As you move around the board, you can buy and sell the commodities as indicated in each city.  All cards cost the same but have varying resale values (some are even worthless).  Complete sets are worth more, and some commodities are worth more than others.&#10;&#10;Assassination can be attempted if you land on one of the two Assassination squares, on the same square as your victim, or once per go around the board if you have enough money (500 k$, forfeiting your turn to do so).  Hired Assassins come in three classes (A through C), the cheaper being less proficient in weaponry than the more expensive ones (A: five weapons; C: three weapons).&#10;&#10;Assassinations are resolved by drawing an Assassin card and comparing it with a Location card; each location lists permissible weapons --if the assassin isn't proficient with at least one of those, too bad.  If he is, you draw a Weapon card to see if he managed to find/smuggle one of the needed weapons.  Assuming the three cards show a match, the designated weapon(s) lists a number that needs to be matched on the dice.  An assassinated player is eliminated.&#10;&#10;To defend, you may offer 1 M$ to the player who ordered the assassination just before the dice are rolled, or you may hire an assassin of your own as a bodyguard.&#10;&#10;";1980;4.97273;1.5556;2;4;90;12;Murder / Mystery, Spies / Secret Agents

5435;North Sea Oil;"Also known as Le P&eacute;trole de la mer du Nord.&#10;&#10;There are 28 oil tiles that will be eventually placed on the 28 spaces.  They vary in depth (three levels) and productivity (zero, small, medium and large deposits).  Deeper deposits require bigger drilling rigs; the more expensive rig can go all the way down but could also be used in a shallower plot.&#10;&#10;The players can explore up to three plots per turn, and can open bidding on up to three plots per turn as well.  Once purchased, a plot may be put into production by buying a rig for it or moving a rig (which costs money) from another plot --there is a limited number of rigs overall.&#10;&#10;Production is affected by weather (weather cards in a winter/spring/summer/fall cycle); the northern plots are more likely to be shut down by bad weather.  Weather causes no production, half production or full production.&#10;&#10;Next, there are the fluctuations in the price of oil.  Most of the time it is 4 $/bbl, but it can occasionally rise to 20 $/bbl.&#10;&#10;Finally, the party in power changes every turn and sets three rates: the interest rate on your debt (you have no money at all at the game outset and must borrow; roughly 5% to 20%), the tax rate on your income (zero to 75%!) and the tax rate on sales (moving rigs, selling rigs and plots to the bank or other players; also zero to 75%).

5439;Numbters;"An interesting UNO derivative.&#10;&#10;From the box:&#10;&#10;All players start with seven cards.

Included is a custom card holder that forms two stacks of played cards - one for letters and one for numbers. The card holder's indicator designates the direction of each stack. Play a card from your hand - making sure it matches the direction of play.&quot; If you can't play a card, draw one. There are also Bomb cards, which make the next player play 2 cards (play when you think they can't!) and every card has the possibility of being a wild card, based on the colors of the discard and matching a small 2 colored circle on each card. &#10;&#10;Interesting family card game with some tactical play possible.&#10;&#10;";2000;5.52;2.0;2;8;90;10;Card Game
5440;Eliminator;"Based on Chess, but with less tactical requirements of the player.&#10;&#10;Players have eight pieces - six soldiers, a King and a Kings Guard. The player starts by rolling a dice, giving him a number that is the maximum moves that player can make during his turn. He may move any pieces he wants as long as their moves add up to or below the total rolled on the dice. All pieces move once for every dot on the dice except the King's Guard, who moves twice, never less, for each spot used.&#10;&#10;This is played out on a chess board with a blue and a red team. Blue moves first. The objectives are either to kill the other King whilst protecting one's own (Eliminator) or just to kill every enemy piece on the board (Speed Eliminator). To perform a kill, your piece must leap frog another. If your piece passes over another - whichever team it belongs to - it is dead and removed from the board.&#10;&#10;Each piece has a forward facing arrow on its head except the King's Guard. These show the directions the pieces are allowed to move in. The KG may move in any direction, but for the other pieces to change direction, the directional dice (which tells you which way to turn) must be rolled instead of the movement dice. The result of the roll must be adhered to with one of your pieces changing direction accordingly.&#10;&#10;If a piece reaches the enemy's side, it recieves a cap that allows it to move in any direction. This cap is also a shield which can 'die' instead of the piece, should the piece be killed. If the piece lands infront of the King, the cap may be transfered, but the piece must remain in the direction it faces when the cap is removed.&#10;&#10;A four player version has been developed and can be accessed from the link below, but email me at writer@philipstobbart.co.uk for the username and password before going for it!&#10;&#10;";2003;0.0;0.0;2;2;10;10;Dice, Fighting

5445;Rod Hockey;"Rod Hockey is a relatively inexpensive representation of the dome-style hockey games found in many arcade halls.&#10;&#10;Using steel rods, plastic or metal hockey players slide along defined track segments.  There are five players and one goalie per side, just like real hockey.  Players simultaneously turn and move their five metal rods to shoot the puck and pass.  Games can be played using a timer or to a set number of points.&#10;&#10;Many different versions of this game have been published over the last 50+ years.&#10;&#10;Steel rods with metal gears were used before plastic ones, the plastic gear system was quickly abandoned as gears would not last. From there a curved spring was used (ImageID: 427829) from rod to player holding slider. This worked well for durability. This changed the game though considerably, as there was a bit of spring action in shooting. Slap shots were less powerful, but wrist shots worked better. Many different ice layouts were made for rod and player movement within the defined track segments. Swiveled tracks made players look like they were skating down the ice. This changed play and tactics for each game, it was considered having home ice advantage, as you were used to your game surface design. You knew how the puck bounced off the boards and where to exploit the best scoring chances. Various pucks were used, heavier ones worked better with the gear system, lighter ones worked better with the spring system. The puck with the steel ball in center moved the fastest and was most popular for the avid player.&#10;&#10;";1932;7.28709;1.4688;2;4;20;0;Action / Dexterity, Sports

5451;Hanafuda;"Hanafuda cards originated in beginning of 18th-century Japan. &#10;Legend says stewards of Edo Shogunate created it from Portuguese playing cards.&#10;&#10;A deck consists of forty-eight cards divided into twelve suits of four cards each. Each suit represents one of the twelve months of the year or individual plants (almost all flowers).&#10;&#10;The cards are small (about 1 x 2 inches), made from stiff cardboard, and are beautifully illustrated.&#10;&#10;Many different games can be played with a Hanafuda deck.&#10;&#10;The standard game was Hachi-Hachi (Eighty-eight), which resembles the Western game Casino, but is more complicated and subtle.

5453;Granada: The Fall of Moslem Spain;"From Avalanche Press:&#10;&#10;For over 700 years, Spanish Christians tried to exterminate the Arab kingdoms of southern Spain. This great &quot;Reconquista&quot; fired the crusading zeal of countless generations. The Arabs, or Moors as the Spanish knew them, saw the Spaniards as backward barbarians and fought ferociously to protect their sophisticated civilization. Finally, in 1482 King Ferdinand of Aragon embarked on the last campaign, to take the fabled city of Granada from its Islamic rulers.&#10;&#10;This quick-playing, physically beautiful game re-creates the final 10-year struggle for Granada. Players take command of the Christian and Moslem holy warriors. God is on your side. Will you prevail? &#10;&#10;Granada is a two-player game based on the 1481-1492 campaign between Ferdinand and Isabella of Aragon and Castille on one side (the &quot;Spanish player&quot;) and Muhammed XII and later Muhammed XIII on the other (the &quot;Moorish player&quot;). The game's designer is Robert G. Markham, known for Soldier Kings: The Seven Years War Worldwide and dozens of other game designs.&#10;&#10;The game is not overly complex. The game board (mounted, 22x17 inches) shows southern Spain including the Kingdom of Granada and surrounding areas. A network of key points is laid over this map, with castles, ports and unfortified areas connected by roads. Troops move along these roads from point to point. The object of the game for the Spanish player is to conquer the Moorish kingdom - Granada herself and five other important Moorish sites. The Moorish player seeks to prevent this, or to force peace on the Spaniards by taking their key cities of Cordoba and Lorca.&#10;&#10;Each player has troops with which to carry out these tasks - knights, cavalry, and foot soldiers plus warships. The Spanish player also has siege cannon. Both players have leaders to move their troops and assist them in battle, with Ferdinand for the Spaniards and Muhammed al-Zagal for the Moors being much better at this than other leaders.&#10;&#10;In battle, both players place their units on a combat display and roll dice to determine how many &quot;hits&quot; are achieved. Four hits will eliminate most units. The best units in the game are the Moorish Jund armored cavalry and the fanatic Spanish Knights of Santiago and Calatrava. A well-manned castle is very difficult to capture, but the Spanish siege guns can make an enormous difference. At sea, the Spanish player is trying to deny the Moor reinforcements from Africa. Many Moorish troops are volunteers from overseas, who must arrive at ports. The Moor can also gain aid from the Ottoman Empire, but only if he or she has kept the ports open.&#10;&#10;";2003;5.99353;2.1579;2;2;120;12;Fighting, Medieval, Wargame
5454;Canadian Checkers;"This game, played mainly in Quebec, is different enough from Checkers to be called a distinct game. It is played on a 12 x 12 board of 144 squares with 30 pieces on a side.&#10;&#10;Un-promoted pieces can capture forward or backward. A promoted piece (queen) moves like a chess bishop, and can capture a piece anywhere along its line of movement.&#10;&#10;One of the rules that set it apart from Draughts and Checkers is Compulsory Capturing. Once begun, you must take all the pieces you are able without stopping short. To do so means the forfeiture of your piece. This can be a strategic move but trying it more than once during a tournament is not advisable.&#10;&#10;This game is part of the Checkers Family&#10;&#10;";0;6.82004;3.0;2;2;30;7;Abstract Strategy

5457;Dread Pirate;"Dread Pirate is an elegantly presented family game focusing on pirate lore and like any good Pirate the one with the most loot wins.&#10;&#10;Each of the pirates start in their own port with a few doubloons and jewels of their own color. The rest of that color of jewel are piled near their port and the remaining doubloons are piled on &ldquo;Dread Island&rdquo; in the center of the map, along with the &lsquo;fate&rsquo; cards that are drawn when sailing through specific marked areas of the board. It is these pirates goal to sail to the other ports and either raid or trade for jewels of the other colors. Once a pirate has at least one jewel of each color they can land on that Dread Island and collect some free doubloons. &quot;Skirmishes&quot;can be had with other pirates at sea and may slow the journey, but the reward of treasure can be great. Once all the jewels are gone from the original piles in the home ports (some will accumulate on Dread Island), the game is over and everyone counts the swag in their pouch.&#10;&#10;The 2002 Signature Edition of this game is packaged in a wooden treasure chest and includes a board in the form of an aged treasure map, three wooden dice, four treasure sacks, four die cast metal ships, one wooden wind cube, fifty-two Dread Pirate cards, four map cards, fifty replica doubloons, 120 treasure jewels, 1st Edition rulebook, and captain&rsquo;s log.

If you choose to do so, you roll the 0 dice in the hope of getting more 1s...But if you roll no 1s, you lose your turn and any 1s rolled previously.  Hence the Temptation.  If you manage to get five 1s, you place five caps (see below) and take another turn.&#10;&#10;The caps won must be placed in a straight orthogonal line, adjacent to at least one previously placed cap.  You lose the caps won if you can't place them.  You may even cap off part of another player's grid --this helps him somewhat, but may make the rest of his grid harder to cap off, by breaking up the pattern.&#10;&#10;When playing multiple rounds, the winner of a round scores the other players' remaining cap spaces.&#10;&#10;";1990;4.375;0.0;2;4;20;0;Abstract Strategy, Dice

Each is rated in Offensive Potential, Defensive Potential and Motion Potential (which is also the Firing Range).  Laser Guns are immobile firing platforms; Force Field Transmitters are obstacles and may be combined to erect linear barriers (when their separation is at most 3 hexes).&#10;&#10;Natural obstacles include Magnetic Storm Zones, Asteroids (fixed and mobile) and a Black Hole.

There's also your Prison Outpost, which is sort of your home base (it doesn't move or shoot). Underneath a secretly chosen ship, you place the peg representing your commander. If he's captured, you lose.&#10;On your turn, you get four dice rolls, which can be used to move (orthogonally) or shoot to capture. You must announce each attempt *before* rolling the dice. Each piece can normally move and/or shoot only once (except Cruisers, who can shoot again if they miss).&#10;&#10;The board is divided into two colors of zones, and this affects shooting and movement. Captured pieces can be freed if you reach the holding Prison Outpost. Having one's Mother Ship captured is real bad because it does not go to the Prison Outpost --it is removed altogether!&#10;&#10;Every time you capture (including ships in one of a Mother Ship's launching bays), you get a bonus roll; basically, the shot that just occurred doesn't count against your four rolls.

One more victory might have turned the war in favor of the Confederacy.&#10;&#10;In desperation, Lincoln placed George B. Mc-Clellan in command. The pursuing Union army caught up to the Confederates at Antietam Creek.&#10;With the Confederates outnumbered 2 to 1, and on Union soil, McClellan had the chance to end the war in a single day. It was the bloodiest day in the history of America. In A GLEAM OF BAYONETS, the map illustrates the orchards, corn and wheat fields, as well as the &lsquo;Bloody Lane&rsquo;, which were bitterly fought over. Colorful counters represent the actual units &mdash; the infantry regiments, artillery batteries, supply wagons and historical commanders.

Three animals stand on two platforms, and you are trying to change their configuration to match a target card by issuing commands like &quot;Ma&quot;, which moves the bottom animal on one platform to the top, or &quot;Ni&quot; which swaps the top two animals on the two platforms. As a result, the game is a race to shout out multi-syllable commands such as the eponymous &quot;MaNiKi&quot;, or &quot;LoNiMaSo&quot;.

5485;Atlantic Wall: The Invasion of Europe June 1944;"6 June 1944: While German Troops battled for their lives on the Eastern Front, all remained quiet in the West.  The long anticipated allied invasion seemed particularly unlikely along this portion of French Coast known as Normandy.  But this was D-Day, and the unlikely was soon to become reality.  As the vast Allied armada came into view, as Allied munitions began to burst upon the quiet French beach and among the German strong-points, the greatest drama in military history began to unfold.&#10;&#10;This game simulates this historical conflict on a five-section map representing the actual area, across which cardboard playing pieces move and engage through an hexagonal grid, which functions like the squares of a chessboard in the outcome of each combat and the success of failure of various game operations.&#10;&#10;Atlantic Wall is a battalion-level game of the D-Day invasion.

5492;Zar;"First there was UNO. Well, first there was Crazy Eights, but never mind.&#10;&#10;Then came Zar which added even more viciousness. The &quot;draw two&quot; card in Zar is a colored Wasp. The trick is, if you play a Wasp in response to being zapped by a wasp, then the opponent to your left must draw 2 cards equal to the numbers of wasp cards in the stack, unless your opponent plays a wasp which would make the next player draw even more cards unless HE also played a wasp, etc.&#10;&#10;It's not uncommon for players to quickly draw huge handfuls of cards. There is a nice  balancing mechanism however. If you can match an identical card that someone just played you can &quot;match&quot; the player by quickly discarding the card. The player who played the original card must draw one card and play passes to the next player from the person who laid the Match. So the more cards you have in your hand, the more matches you can make to get rid of them.&#10;&#10;Zar has a faster pace than UNO and constantly keeps you on toes to match your opponent's cards. This increases player interaction, excitement, and much more chaos.&#10;&#10;If even Zar becomes too tame for you check out The Totally Insane Card Game.&#10;&#10;";1981;6.77843;1.8;2;8;30;6;Card Game

5497;Virus Alert;"From the publisher's website:&#10;&#10;The basic premise of the game is to acquire 10 virus-free Object cards that represent computer resources such as Graphics, Software, Web Pages, Games, Documents, and Email. Action cards provide game play strategy that allows players to introduce viruses (represented by tokens) onto their opponent&rsquo;s Object cards. You can&rsquo;t win unless you have 10 Object cards on your side with no virus tokens on them. Other Action cards shield your Objects from viruses (like Anti Virus), and help to clean virus tokens off your Object cards (Cleanup). There are Action cards that allow you to steal a card from another player (Piracy), remove anti-virus protection (AV Killer), or that pesky Virus Generator card (Scan), or search for a card in the discard pile (Backup). Some Action cards like Virus!, Recycle or Repair use a 6-sided die to determine how many virus tokens are placed or removed from your Object cards. This adds an aspect of chance to the game, and helps make every game you play different.&#10;&#10;A more attainable goal of playing to just 6 virus-free objects is recommended by some players.&#10;&#10;";2001;5.67647;1.0;2;6;20;8;Card Game
5498;Maltese;"Maltese uses tiles in an original rummy-type game in which completing sets can enable players to force tiles out of their opponent's hands.&#10;&#10;Tiles come in 5 colors, and each tile has an inset in any of those same 5 colors.  Half of the insets will match the tile's exterior, half won't.  So, for example, of the 16 green tiles, 8 have green insets, 2 have orange, 2 have white, 2 have read, and 2 have blue.&#10;&#10;All players can see the external color of a tile, but only the owner sees its inset - and the inset color is what really counts.&#10;&#10;Additionally, each player has a tile holder (&quot;shield&quot;) which holds the tiles in 5 rows.  When playing into this section of the shield, all the tiles in a row must be a single color (inset), and each row must be a different color.  So you'll have one row that is all-white, one that is all-red, etc, but you can choose which is which.  Furthermore, each row contains a different # of tiles, from 1-5.  The goal is to completely fill in this section of your shield: a total of 5 matched rows with a total of 15 tiles.&#10;&#10;A typical turn involves choosing a tile randomly, placing it into your hand, and then moving one tile from your hand into the central, scoring, part of the shield.  There are two key moves that occur.  One is when you complete a row.  At this point, you announce ALL UNFINISHED ROWS OF THAT SAME INSET COLOR GO BACK TO THE ARMORY (Draw pile).  This is where both the varying # of tiles, and the limited information are crucial.  You could, for example, play a single green tile in your &quot;#1&quot; row - and complete it.  If an opponent is working on a larger green row that is incomplete, he may have to discard as many as 4 green tiles.  You know that half of the green exterior tiles are green - so you only have limited information as to which of your opponents' rows might be green, or if they are even working on any green rows.&#10;&#10;The second attack move occurs when you complete a row that is entirely &quot;matched&quot; (Insert color matches exterior color).  You can even do this by replacing unmatched tiles with matched tiles in rows you've already completed.  You then announce ALL FINISHED BUT UNMATCHED ROWS OF THAT SAME ROW NUMBER ARE BACK TO THE ARMORY.  In this case, if you complete a matched #3 row, all opponents who have completed unmatched #3 rows must toss all of these three tiles back into the draw pile.&#10;&#10;Game ends when the first player completes all 5 rows with 5 different colors - matched or not.&#10;&#10;";1977;6.5;0.0;2;4;30;0;Abstract Strategy, Card Game

5501;Death in the Dark;"Published in 1998, and based off of The Universal Soldiers tabletop miniatures rules by Colin McClelland, Paul Sharpe &amp; John Laing, this game is similar to Mordheim, in its fantasy skirmish theme.  The theme in this game, however, is that of rival mining companies fighting for success in the mines/dungeons/caverns &quot;surrounding the underground holdings of Arkonis.&quot;&#10;&#10;The base game comes with two sides:  the Dwarven Prospectors vs. the Vanir (dark elves) and their &quot;terrible&quot; spider minions.&#10;&#10;The game features upgrading units, hiring mercenaries, and buying weapons and equipment between scenarios.  The combat rules are more streamlined than that of Morheim, and the campaign game is more fleshed out.  You can buy add-ons to the home base of your mining company that can do numerous things for you.  Things that increase income, security, etc.&#10;&#10;Many battles take place in the corridors of the mines, but the battle can be taken to a player's home base if needed.  As such, players map out their home bases as they purchase rooms (e.g. jails, vaults, storage, etc), fortifications (e.g. gates, walls, traps, etc), and other assorted upgrades on to them.&#10;&#10;RAFM has released other races to play, including Orcs, Undead, and &quot;Reptiliads&quot; (lizard men) to name a few.  In addition, the game works very well with the line of dungeon scenery from Dwarven Forge.  The playing time noted above should be considered the time for one or two scenarios, including the in between campaign management.  But, like most games of this type, it can go on for as long as you like.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.83333;0.0;2;2;120;10;Fantasy, Fighting, Miniatures

Special units such as airmobile, airborne, and amphibious troops, with their abilities to outflank a line, become even more important.&#10;Another important feature is the tangled web of Balkan politics, Romania is the least reliable of the Pact countries, and its participation is half-hearted at best. A second scenario allows for its total neutrality, forcing the Soviets to reinforce their armies and invade before taking on NATO. Greece and Turkey are uneasy allies, and rules allow for Greek withdrawal from NATO. And Albania is completely unpredictable.&#10;&#10;Additional rules allow Southern Front to be combined with The Third World War: Battle for Germany; players can reinforce one front with forces from the other, requiring a host of new decisions on the strategic level. One or two new divisions or air units sent to the Balkans can turn the tide there, but at what cost to the main front, where every unit is desperately needed ?&#10;&#10;";1984;7.40198;3.3571;2;2;360;12;Modern Warfare, Wargame
5512;Fighting Fantasy Battle Cards;"Battlecards are best decribed as a &quot;scratch-and-slay trading card game&quot; that preceded the popular Magic: The Gathering, and Pok&#195;&#169;mon Trading Card Game craze.&#10;&#10;There were a great variety of cards arranged into types which included artist profiles, quests, tactics, advanced game rules, checklists, spells, and shields, but the main cards were Fighters.&#10;&#10;Each Fighter card had a series of 25 silver scratch panels around its main central illustration to represent locations of the body. For the basic game, players take turns to make an attack by scratching away a panel of their rival to reveal the symbol underneath. When enough wound symbols were found, one of the fighter's 'life' panels would be uncovered and a skull symbol signified his defeat. The dead fighter card would then be given to the winning player who could use the card's 'purse' (an amount of gold listed in the corner) to purchase 'Wondrous Treasure' cards by mailing Merlin with gold equal to the price agreed on a Trading Post card. These are the rarer &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot; edition of the 'Wondrous Treasure' cards.&#10;&#10;Quest cards normally required collectors to study their cards carefully then send the correct ones to Merlin so they could claim a reward of gold. For example, to claim a token worth 100 gold, St. Charity's Quest required you to collect five men with no gold in their purses, which obviously required you to defeat them first. Lord Magnoble's quest was worth 200 gold if you identified the artists of the five unsigned pieces in his collection.&#10;&#10;Two different series exist: the UK version and the US version. The US series had 139 cards in the basic series plus eight chase treasure cards (T1-T8). US #140 was the Emperor of Vangoria, not available in packs but redeemed by mailing in all 8 treasure cards (and effectively &quot;winning&quot; the game). The #140 card was available in &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot; chased versions like the 'Wondrous Treasure' cards by completing the Emperor quest using Gold and Silver 'Wondrous Treasure' cards. US cards were standard US trading card sized with gold scratch-offs and an eggshell finish. The UK series had 149 basic cards as the 8 treasure cards were numbered within the basic set, plus there were two additional strategy cards not included in the US set. The UK Emperor was #150, again only acquired by redeeming all 8 treasure cards. UK cards are larger than the US cards, have a gloss finish and silver scratch-offs. There are also extra rules to cater for using shields in the UK version.&#10;&#10;Buy Microbadge&#10;&#10;&#10;";1993;5.02542;2.25;2;2;10;10;Adventure, Card Game, Collectible Components, Fantasy, Fighting, Novel-based

Any tiles that can't be used are left on the table and turned over again where they are. No tiles may be added to or removed from a row on a scoreboard that contains only one or two tiles. If none of the tiles turned up can fit on a free row, the player must declare one of his free rows invalid by placing one of the tiles turned up face down on the first square of the row (the others are returned to the table face down).&#10;&#10;Game ends after the tenth round, and the winner is the one with the most points.&#10;&#10;";2003;5.23387;1.1429;2;4;20;8;Memory

Note that the Pink Panther moves on each player's turn.

The risk, however, is that by landing on an &quot;Escapes?&quot; space, the player may lose a Pink Panther card (this isn't as bad as it sounds, since the space gives a card as often as it takes one).  If both the Pink Panther and the player land on an &quot;Escapes?&quot;/&quot;Trapped?&quot; space simultaneously, this is considered an automatic Escape/Capture.&#10;&#10;On an &quot;Escapes?&quot; space, if you have two or more Pink Panther cards, you may go for the &quot;Big Chance&quot;.

In JACTVS, players throw dice in an attempt to be the first to win an image of Venus, the goddess of love; an image of the little dog and a Roman coin.&#10;&#10;Contents: &#10;&#10;    4 replica Roman coins&#10;    3 images of Venus&#10;    9 images of a dog&#10;    5 dice marked I, II, III, IV, V and VI&#10;&#10;&#10;by PAST TIMES, Oxford, England&#10;MADE IN ENGLAND&#10;Devised and created by Oxford Games Ltd.&#10;&#10;The back of the rules contain historical information about Roman coins as well as the emperors Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, Septimius Severus and Carausius.&#10;&#10;";1994;3.21429;1.0;2;6;360;10;Dice

5549;Das Wasser des Lebens;"Das Wasser des Lebens (&quot;The Water of Life&quot;) is a re-theming of Settlers of Catan issued in partnership with the Glen Grant Distillery Company.  The game itself is basically identical, but the theme is centered around Scotch whisky production.  As Scottish Highlanders, players collect wood, stones, barley, peat, and clear spring water.  With these materials they build roads and distilleries.  The all too familiar robber from Settlers of Catan has become the &quot;oppressive force&quot;.&#10;&#10;Das Wasser des Lebens features all new artwork and is packaged in the same metal cylinder that each bottle of Glen Grant Whisky ships in.  As a final added bonus, the game even includes a small bottle of Glen Grant Whisky for the players to enjoy after a hard day in the fields.&#10;&#10;Belongs to the Catan Series.&#10;&#10;";1997;7.61471;2.6667;3;4;60;21;Civilization
5550;Changing Society;"A Monopoly clone with a twist... you are never forced out of the game... you just become your descendant, go back on welfare, and keep going.&#10;&#10;Components restrict the game to six, but any number can play.  Players keep going until a set time limit is reached (I suggest at least 2 hours) or when the there is only one player left in the game (if played without descendants).  If descendants are being used, the game is never ending and can go on indefinitely.&#10;&#10;The highs and lows of society are portrayed by spaces on the board.  Businesses may be bought and sold, players may get a higher education, join a Co-op, become a thief, enter the military, etc.&#10;&#10;An additional random element is in the form of 'Change' cards.  With the draw of a card you can become an alcoholic, get busted and sent to prison, become a parent of quintuplets, etc.  Because there are only 54 of these cards, they seem to come up again and again... expecially when six are playing.&#10;&#10;Elections make the game the most fun.  During an election, players are encouraged to put issues to a vote... majority rules.  This allows aspects of the game rules to be changed or outright ingored!  Because of this, interesting things can happen, for example: elimination of taxes or a military coup d'etat.&#10;&#10;";1979;3.2;1.0;3;6;120;0;Economic, Educational

Whoever played the card that &quot;captured&quot; the most pieces of one color in that round (using the normal Othello capturing rules) picks up all the cards from that round and puts them in his score pile.&#10;&#10;When all the cards have been played, the winner is the player who has scored the most cards.&#10;&#10;";2002;3.6875;1.1667;2;4;45;8;Abstract Strategy, Card Game
5554;Vampire;"Die Nacht der Vampire is a casual game with a vampire hunting theme.&#10;&#10;Each player takes the role of a vampire hunter entering the grounds of Castle Gruselstein, Count Dracula's castle. The board features a unique, 3D design with one half the board containing the castle grounds and the other half containing the castle stairs and castle. The castle stairway is a molded plastic insert into the board with slots on each stair for the vampires to stand in vertically. At the back edge of the stairway, a cutout for the castle itself rises vertically from the board.&#10;&#10;The game setup includes populating the castle stairs with 11 vampires (6 castle guests, and 5 butlers). On each player's turn, they can take one of three actions: 1. Move their vampire hunter, then move the vampires, 2. Draw hunt cards, then move the vampires, or 3. Move the vampires, and then throw a garlic clove.&#10;&#10;Moving the vampires involves turning over a vampire card and sliding the number of vampires the number of spaces indicated on the designated rows.&#10;&#10;If the player throws a garlic clove, they declare how many hunt cards they would like to use, and then they turn over hunt cards one at a time. The hunt cards either move the garlic clove toward the vampires on the stair within the column or forces both the hunter and clove backward. If the clove reaches a vampire, the vampire is captured, removed from the stair, and replaced from the supply. When all vampires in the supply are exhausted, the Count is brought out.&#10;&#10;When the Count is captured, the game is over and the player with the most points in captured vampires wins.&#10;&#10;";2003;5.65302;1.2273;2;4;30;8;Horror

5556;Treasure (in the Canadian Rockies);"Each player has a team of three figures, two adventurers and one guide. The guide is used to collect &quot;Grub Stake&quot; cards which allow you to climb the mountain and get the treasure. Your adventurers are used to climb for the gold and to delay other players.&#10;&#10;The game is interesting in that it has a molded plastic wall which must be climbed. The square 'Grub Stake' cards are placed into slots on the wall to allow a players figure to ascend the mountain.&#10;&#10;Movement is by roll of two dice which may be split amongst any of your three figures. The pieces move in a straight line only... no turns are allowed during a move.&#10;&#10;If a &quot;Bear&quot; card is discovered while exploring, it can be used to send an opponent back to start or delay him while he's climbing for treasure.&#10;&#10;The game is entirely dependent on the roll of the dice and the cards gained through random draw. Nevertheless, it's a fun little race game with a 3D board.&#10;&#10;";1978;4.0;2.0;2;4;45;0;American West, Exploration
5557;Ben Casey M.D.;"Players roll a die and move through the rooms of a fictional hospital collecting Reports.  There are four different kinds: Symptom, X-Ray, Laboratory, and Spinal Tap.&#10;&#10;When a player has collected at least one of each report he may attempt to match these reports to a Diagnosis card.  If they match, the player takes the Diagnosis along with the matching reports and places them in front of him.  If they don't match, the diagnosis is replaced, face down, where it came from.&#10;&#10;Play continues until all of the Diagnosis cards have been 'filled'... the player with the most correct diagnoses is the winner.&#10;&#10;The only skill involved is in remembering what each diagnosis requires and where they are on the charts.  The rest of the game is simple roll and move and hope that you land on the right combination of Reports.&#10;&#10;";1961;6.5;1.0;2;4;45;10;Medical, Memory, Movies / TV / Radio theme

If he holds a 'Radar Image' and an empty screen exists it must be played (this is the only compulsory play).  Monster Parts may only be played on areas that have an Image.&#10;&#10;The first person to get rid of his hand of cards wins.&#10;&#10;A good card matching game for Ages 7 - 12... not much more.&#10;&#10;";1964;3.675;1.0;2;4;30;7;Card Game, Children's Game, Movies / TV / Radio theme
5559;Sky Galleons of Mars;"Sky Galleons of Mars is a board game set in the fantasy Victorian era of space exploration.  It is essentially the tactical ship combat game for the &quot;Space: 1889&quot; role-playing system.&#10;&#10;The game has a lot of mechanics that are similar to Star Fleet Battles and Interceptor.  It has a distinct 'naval' feel about it though... think of a game like Wooden Ships & Iron Men, with altitude thrown into the mix.&#10;&#10;The game is played in turns of three phases.  In the Initiative Phase, players form or disband boarding parties and change crew assignments.  They also roll dice to see who becomes the First Player that turn.&#10;&#10;Two Movement/Fire Phases follow.  The moving player moves all of his vessels, both players fire (depending on range, weapon, etc.), damage is taken, then the second player repeats the full move/fire action.&#10;&#10;Two large hex, beautifully rendered maps are included in the game to accomodate detailed plastic ships.  The rules are broken into two parts: Basic (the game at its simplest level with basic rules for moving, firing, taking damage, etc.) and Advanced (adds more detailed rules such as: ramming and grappling, towing, small arms, crew quality, etc.).  Also included are seven Scenarios and rules for a Campaign game.&#10;&#10;Replaced by Ironclads And Ether Flyers&#10;&#10;";1988;6.83474;2.2917;2;6;120;10;Aviation / Flight, Miniatures, Science Fiction, Wargame
5560;Steve Canyon;"Based on the popular comic strip, Steve Canyon, this game lets up to four players fly their F-105 Thunderchiefs to three different air bases. The first person to complete this circuit wins.&#10;&#10;Very luck driven, in that a roll of one die determines movement on the map and also altitude increments of 1,000 ft. Player choices amount to deciding what altitude to fly and which air field to visit next.&#10;&#10;Random weather cards cause problems while flying over certain areas of the board or flying through certain altitudes. Fuel consumption is basically one unit every time the die is rolled, and running out of fuel can force a landing at an emergency air field or cause a pilot to bail out.&#10;&#10;The game is interesting because of the scale plastic planes used as playing pieces (actual reproductions of the F-105) and in the cardboard 'control panels' which players use to keep track of altitude and fuel. The rules also include a two-page insert describing &quot;the world's most powerful one-man airplane&quot; in detail.&#10;&#10;";1959;6.66667;1.0;2;4;60;0;Adventure, Comic Book / Strip, Racing

When a researcher discovers a chamber, trips a mechanism that unlocks the chamber.  The chambers may be discover one to three times.  Inside the temples are treasures.  The more frequently it is discovered, the less treasure will be found.  However, once in a while, a snake emerges from a temple that brings a curse.  During the game, the players can alter the results of the cube throw once in a while to discover a certain chamber.&#10;&#10;Gunter Baars has created many games with this mechanism that play in the box.

5576;Dungeoneer: Tomb of the Lich Lord;"'Dungeoneer - Perilous Adventures in an Ever-Changing Labyrinth.&#10;&#10;In Dungeoneer', you take up the mantle of a great Hero set out to prove your valor in the Tomb of the Lich Lord. To triumph over your rivals, you will need to explore the labyrinth of corridors, defeat the heinous monsters, overcome nefarious traps and be the first to complete all your Quests. But beware, the gods are fickle and to test their Heroes even further, they often bestow upon them Banes as well as Boons.&#10;&#10;Game Description:&#10;&#10;This simple card game is very reminiscent of Wiz-War. Players are dealt one of 4 Heroes, each with varying movement, fighting and magic abilities. The Dwarf for example is very tough, but has no magic value at all. Each Hero also has a value for hit points, the amount of Treasure he can have (carry) at any time and also the number of &quot;Boons&quot; (special abilities) he may have. Players are dealt 3 quest cards initially in front of them (public knowledge) and have 5 Adventure cards in hand.&#10;&#10;Each turn a player may:&#10;&#10;     Discard unwanted cards and draw back to 5 cards.&#10;     Play Encounters and/or Bane cards (always on opponents never on yourself).&#10;     Build the Dungeon.&#10;     Move (collect Peril and Glory tokens).&#10;&#10;&#10;Players will collect Peril tokens as they move which then makes them targets for others to play Encounter/Bane cards against them (Encounter/Bane cards have a fee to play - which is paid for by the person who the card is played ON with Peril tokens). This  simple mechanic balances the game by spreading the attacks around as you can't attack someone that can't pay the Peril price.&#10;&#10;Players attempt various quests (some are simple die rolls in a certain room, some are tough combat and some a series of things to do), with each completed quest having your Hero &quot;go up a level&quot; which increases his abilities.&#10;&#10;Treasures &amp; Boons help you, Banes, Traps &amp; Encounters hurt you (which are played on you by other players).&#10;&#10;The dungeon map is different each time as it is made up of cards played one at time onto the table by each player.&#10;&#10;This game was introduced at DunDraCon 2003, in San Ramon, Ca. There are several planned expansions, and two special cards available by mail if you purchased at the convention.&#10;&#10;First game in the Dungeoneer Series.&#10;&#10;";2003;6.09815;2.1934;2;4;60;12;Adventure, Card Game, Dice, Exploration, Fantasy

It's a glittering casino right in your own home.&#10;&#10;You get dice tokens to start the game, and the object is to get just one into the center of the board by rolling the correct sequences.  Sounds easy? It's not.&#10;&#10;The danger of the game is when your opponent gets hot and blows you right off the board.

5656;France 1944: The Allied Crusade in Europe;"(David A. Vandenbroucke review - http://grognard.com/reviews/france44.txt):&#10;&#10;France 1944 (Victory Games) is a Mark Herman design.  It's a 130 counter, 1 map game of the breakout and pursuit across France. Units are divisions, I believe.  Components are up to VG's usual high standards.&#10;&#10;Complexity is rated as &quot;low,&quot; and solitaire suitability is &quot;medium.&quot;  The most interesting aspect of the game is that it seriously tries to model time over the course of the player's turn. You activate HQs, which can then control a varying number of infantry or armor units, depending on nationality.  There is a track display that you use during movement/combat.  As you make decisions about which actions to take, you branch along the track, limiting your options about what you can do next. Essentially this captures the passage of time required for certain actions.  It's easier to play than it is to describe.&#10;&#10;For example, suppose you have an armor division near the enemy and a couple of infantry divisions further away. If you move up the infantry to attack and make a breakthrough, the armored unit will probably not be able to move very far through the breach. In effect, the armored unit has spent most of the turn waiting around for the infantry to get in position and make its attack.&#10;&#10;The game puts emphasis on elite units on both sides and on the brittleness of the powerful British formations (no replacements).&#10;Chrome rules cover Market-Garden and the Bulge.&#10;&#10;";1986;6.19414;2.9412;2;2;360;12;Wargame, World War II
5657;Maniac;"An electronic game that is actually four games in one.&#10;&#10;Each of up to four players has an electronic 'paddle' mounted on the game console.&#10;&#10;In the first round, Maniac plays random tones and then suddenly stops.  The first player to hit their paddle gets 2 points, the second player gets a point.  Anyone else gets a &quot;raspberry&quot;.&#10;&#10;In round two, Maniac plays a series of random tones of varying speed and pitch.  The players nust count the tones.  When done, Maniac starts beeping... when the number of beeps equal the number of tones, players hit their paddles.  Again, if you get the correct number you gain 2 points, if you are one off you get a point, otherwise you get the &quot;raspberry&quot;.&#10;&#10;Third round... Maniac displays beeps and lights in a seeming random patern, then displays three more patterns (one of which may or may not match the original).  If the original pattern is repeated... hit that paddle.  The 2 points, one point, zero points are awarded as before.&#10;&#10;Last round.  Maniac plays a constant high pitched tone for a length of time.  When the tone stops, players must hold down their paddle for the same length of time... whoever is closest gets the 2 points... etc.&#10;&#10;Each of the above rounds are repeated three times before moving on to the next.  If nobody has won the game, it repeats the rounds in order.&#10;&#10;When one player has obtained 25 points he wins.&#10;&#10;";1979;5.17727;2.0;2;4;20;8;Electronic, Memory

5663;WFF 'N PROOF;"The complete set of 21 games that started with the game of WFF (q.v.).&#10;&#10;The game includes 36 special dice, a timer, and a 184 page rules and examples manual.&#10;&#10;The games included in this set are actually a set of logic rules presented in a 'Programmed Instruction' order.  Each game adds to all prior games until Game 21, Frantic WFF 'N PROOF, is attained.&#10;&#10;As well as building WFFs (Well Formed Formulas), players must also try to reach a goal by using rules of inference.&#10;&#10;For example: If the goal is 'p', a player could use the 'Ko' (or Conjunction Out) rule and use 'Kpq' as a premise.  In other terms, if the following sentence is true: &quot;The first games of WFF 'N PROOF are easy and the last games of WFF 'n PROOF are hard.&quot;  Then it can be inferred that the following sentence is true: &quot;The first games of WFF 'N PROOF are easy.&quot;&#10;&#10;Up to 36 dice are rolled depending on the game being played.  One player sets a 'goal' by building a WFF in the goal area of the playing mat.  players then alternate playing dice to the &quot;permitted&quot; or &quot;essential&quot; sections of the play area.  If a die is placed in the essential area it MUST be used in either a premise or a rule.  If a player doesn't think that it can be used, he can challenge his opponent.&#10;&#10;To win, a player must make a successful challenge or be unsuccessfully challenged.&#10;&#10;Games 3 through 19 introduce the 11 Rules of Logical Inference in this order: Conjunction, Implication, Reiteration, Disjunction, Negation, and Equivalence.  Then 18 more derived rules are added to the mix for Game 20, the PC (Propositional Calculus) game.  The 21st and final game, Frantic WFF 'N PROOF, takes the PC game and adds timed moves for rapid and chaotic scoring.&#10;&#10;";1962;4.88406;3.8;2;4;45;6;Abstract Strategy, Memory
5664;3 Or More;"44 tiles, each having three coloured spots are shuffled and placed face down. There are four different colours of spots.  Two tiles of each colour are 'triples' and have three spots the same.  The remaining tiles are all unique, and each colour has exactly 33 spots.&#10;&#10;Each player picks three tiles and a player is chosen to start the game.  Play is simple, place a tile to the table on either side of an already placed tile.  Once a row of 11 tiles is formed, a new row must be started.  The player then draws to refill his hand to three.&#10;&#10;Whenever three or more spots of a colour exist, a player scores one point for each spot, diagonal lines count double.   A player who plays a 'triple' automatically gains at least three points.&#10;&#10;The game ends when four rows have been completed... all 44 tiles are played.  The player who scored the highest total wins.&#10;&#10;In the German/Dutch/French/Nordic versions of Domingo (published by Ravensburger), there are 48 tiles, but the game otherwise appears to be identical.&#10;&#10;";1980;5.8;1.4;2;4;30;7;Abstract Strategy, Children's Game

The prosecution team has 5 minutes to form a case.&#10;&#10;The game is played like a real trial, witnesses are called, evidence is examined and the Judge makes rulings.  When the final closing statements are made, the Judge and Jury each get a Verdict sheet and vote Guilty, Not Guilty or Abstain.&#10;&#10;If the majority vote is Guilty, the Prosecutor and all Jurors who voted Guilty win the game.

The code-maker makes a code out of any combination of 4 colors (out of 6 possible colors).  The code-breaker has 6 guesses to figure out the code.&#10;&#10;After each code guess, the code-maker gives a clue, by placing a black peg for every correct color in the correct position, and placing a white peg for every correct color, in the wrong position.&#10;&#10;Players generally switch roles after the code is broken or the code-breaker failed to solve the solution.

5669;Salvo!;"This is a simulation of battleship combat, which abstracts each ship to four numeric attributes: attack, defense, speed and range.&#10;What you get is a thick paper map (22&quot; x 16&quot;) showing some coast outlines in different colors, 200 &frac12;&quot; cardboard counters, a 12-page rule-book and two dice. The counters represent WW2 battleships, cruisers and destroyers of various nationalities, plus markers to show ship speed and direction, targets, and damage inflicted.&#10;&#10;[From the back of the box]&#10;Salvo is a fast paced, exciting simulation of surface Battleship actions of the Second World War. Practically every class of battleship that fought is represented, such as the Bismark, Iowa, Yamato and King George V. Cruisers and destroyers are represented by screening units. Scenarios include destruction of the French fleet at Mers-ek-Kebir, Suriago Strait, Second Guadalcanal, Calabria, North Cape and the Bismarck encounters. Hypothetical scenarios include such things as what might have happened if Halsey had deployed Lee's battleships to San Bernardino Strait during Leyte Gulf.&#10;&#10;All the essentials of naval warfare are recreated, including gunnery, torpedoes, damage control and maneuvers. Also included are special rules depicting friendly fire, mines, command control, crew quality and shore batteries. Your playing skill will determine leadership quality!

5699;Afrika: The North African Campaign, 1940-1942;"Afrika: The Northern African Campaign, 1940-1942, is a simulation game covering the North African Campaign from September, 1940 through December, 1942. In late 1940, the Italian Army invaded Egypt beginning the famous North African Campaign of World War II. After a short withdrawal, the Commonwealth forces counterattacked and all but threw the Italians back to Tripoli. Not content to let his southern partner bring disgrace to the Axis arms, Hitler dispatched a German contingent under a new commander: Erwin Rommel. His arrival began a rapid mobile campaign across the rocky sands.  However, by the end of 1942, Rommel had failed in his final bid to seize the Nile Delta and was thrown completely out of the theater by Montgomery's pursuit after El Alamein. Axis fortunes would never rise on the African continent again.&#10;&#10;Afrika is a fast paced game of mobile warfare at the operational level. Can you take the Nile? Can your Commonwealth forces kick the Axis armor out of Egypt for good?  This game gives you the tools to find out.

The soundtrack indicates whether it is day or night - certain cards may only be taken at certain times - and many cards require the player to shoot a target or run round the table before a scream is heard on the soundtrack. If they fail, they lose a member of their squad.&#10;&#10;The player who recovers the most treasure wins the game.&#10;&#10;";2002;6.41135;1.3182;2;4;20;12;Action / Dexterity, Adventure, Card Game, Real-time
5713;Game of Politics;"Politics simulates a simplified version of the presidential election in the United States of America (electoral votes based on the 1930 or 1950 census, depending upon the edition of the game).&#10;&#10;The playing board represents a map of the United States showing each state and its capital.  The goal in both editions is to win the vote, which occurs when all the states have at least one candidate in it and someone rolls doubles. The player who has the most counties in any given state wins all the electoral votes from that state; in case of a tie, the player who reached the total first wins the state. If one player does not have a majority of electoral votes (269), only the two players with the highest votes continue - the rest are eliminated. It continues until another official vote is taken and a winner is determined.&#10;&#10;In the 1935 edition, campaigning is conducted via a mix of dice rolls and speech cards.  Players are given money and three speech cards at the beginning of the game, and whenever 7 or 11 is rolled an additional speech card is auctioned.  Speech cards give players a small number of counties in specific states, allowing players to more effectively focus their campaigning and make comebacks.  On a turn, players roll three dice.  The dice (all the same color) are summed, and the total can be used to campaign in each of the 48 states.  Small states - those with 3 to 5 electoral votes - take only 1 point to win a county, while larger states require as many as nine points to win a county.&#10;&#10;The 1952 edition is significantly simplified.  On a player's turn, the player rolls 3 dice (1 colored, 2 white) - the colored dice tells the player which states to be worked in this turn and the white dice tells the player how many &quot;counties&quot; (4-7 in each state) they win.&#10;&#10;";1935;5.64545;0.0;2;6;60;0;Political
5718;Cranium Cariboo;"Cranium Cariboo is a game for young children (Ages 3 - 6) to help them learn letters, numbers/counting, colors, and shapes.&#10;&#10;Players take turns drawing a card and opening one of the treasure hunt doors that has a trait corresponding to the card (color, number of objects, etc.).  Once the door is opened, players look for a ball.  If they find one, they drop it in the &quot;tide pool&quot;.  Once all six balls are found, the treasure chest opens and everyone wins (there are scoring rules, if a cooperative win is not desirable).&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;Cariboo Island&#10;&#10;";1998;6.0905;1.0455;2;4;20;4;Children's Game, Educational
5719;X from Outer Space;"This is a basic &quot;roll-and-move&quot; children's game with a twist, as each turn you roll one white and two red dice.&#10;&#10;You move your ship forward along the path using the value of the white die.  If you land on a space with a number, you then multiply the large blue number on the space by the sum of your red dice.  If the result is equal to the little red number in the space, you move forward 5 spaces.  If the result is greater than the red number, you move forward 1.  If the result is less than the red number, you move back 1.  Planet Zoomer and Black Hole cards are drawn at different places on the board and move the player's pawn forward or backward along the track.&#10;&#10;The first person to reach the sun (the end of the track) wins.&#10;&#10;";1985;4.5;1.0;2;4;30;8;Children's Game, Educational, Math, Science Fiction, Space Exploration

Six of the dice are always used and are placed in a cup (not provided).&#10;&#10;The offensive player then selects one die secretly from a set of four dice, each representing a particular strategy for that at bat (Swing Away, Power Swing, Make Contact, and Stay Back.) The results on each die are in keeping with what would be expected from the chosen strategy.&#10;&#10;Simultaneously, the defensive player chooses one die from a set of four that represent defensive strategies (Overpower, Induce Grounder, Induce Fly, Pitch Around) and adds it to the cup.&#10;&#10;Once all the dice are in the cup, they are rolled. The result that is most common is the result for that at bat. There are, of course, rules for breaking ties. There are also strategy options on offense and defense that can affect the outcome.&#10;&#10;";2002;5.92593;1.0;2;2;30;8;Sports

5726;Tycoon;"Tycoon is a stock market trading game.&#10;&#10;Players move around the board, buy and sell stocks and bonds, and check rising and falling prices of held stocks.&#10;&#10;Originally self-published in 1962, Parker Brothers bought the rights and republished it in 1966.  It was later self-published again as Arbitrage.&#10;&#10;A description of Arbitrage:&#10;&#10;Arbitrage (HC Jacoby Inc) is a stock market and corporate manipulation board game. The board is a Monopoly type with the movement track around the edge, with the middle taken up mostly by price tracks for the 6 corporations in the game. Each corporation has 3 spaces in a row on the outside track that counts as its home. Then there are a few other spaces that allow specific actions like buying/selling mutual funds, draw a random event, or draw a stock manipulation card. Stocks are bought by landing on one of the 3 spaces of a corporation's home, or by landing on a mutual fund space. If you own 3 stocks of a corporation, you become its president and can either pay out dividends to stockholders, or you can merge corporations, thus increasing stock prices. Other things that can happen are 'takeovers' - forcing a resident to sell you his shares, or 'options' - a chance to buy shares from the bank (or another player for 1/2 price). Trading of shares between players at any time is also encouraged. The game ends after a set amount of time, or when a player goes bankrupt.&#10;&#10;Movement around the board is accomplished with 3 dice (2 regular d6, and 1 special die which has symbols on it to move stock prices either up or down). A player's turn consists of rolling the three dice, moving his marker to the new space, manipulating a stock price up or down by the die roll, then performing the action on the space where you landed (if any).&#10;&#10;";1962;5.17368;1.0;2;6;60;10;Economic

5740;Strat-O-Matic Pro Football;"One of the several statistically-based sports simulations produced by the Strat-O-Matic Game Company.  The game consists of player cards and team defensive cards that accurately reproduce play outcomes and player, team, and league statistics of the National Football League for the season on which the cards are based.  Play progresses with the gamer on offense calling his play (run or pass, where the play is directed, the ball carrier or primary receiver, etc.) and the gamer on defense setting a defensive configuration (blitzes, double coverage of receivers, stacking the line, etc.).  In the cards and dice version, three dice are then rolled, with one die determining whether the play result comes from the offensive or defensive cards and the other two determining the result from the speciifed card.  Play takes place on a game board that resembles a football field, and the gamers keep track of the ball position, the down, and the time remaining in the quarter being played.  Penalties and injuries are part of the game.  Gamers play from the perspective of a head coach and/or general manager.&#10;&#10;The game also comes in a computer version that automatically determines play outcomes and compiles and reports player, team and league statistics.  The computer version grapically portrays the plays using X's and O's to depict player movement.  The computer version also features a sophisticated computer coach that faciltates solitaire play.&#10;&#10;Each year the Strat-O-Matic Game Company issues a new set of player and team cards (or computer disk) based upon the most recent NFL season.

There are two circular paths around the airstrip: the Holding Pattern and the Landing Pattern.  Players take turns to roll a die to move their planes on the board.  The planes must first enter the Holding Pattern, then the Landing Pattern before they can land on the airstrip; players slide down the planes on their stands as they do so.&#10;&#10;Each space on the board contains instructions that must be followed.  Emergency and Special Clearance cards are drawn when planes land on their space, and their effects (beneficial and detrimental) must be executed.  Planes can only enter the Landing Pattern through the effects of certain Special Clearance cards.  To land on the airstrip, planes must land exactly on the Final Approach spaces on the Landing Pattern.  Players then need to roll on their next turn to determine if their planes can taxi to and park at their designated gates.&#10;&#10;The first player to park all his or her planes is the winner.  The game ends when the third player has parked his or her planes, effectively establishing the rest of the positions.&#10;&#10;";1974;5.76667;0.0;2;4;30;10;Aviation / Flight, Transportation

Fighting takes place on beaches, in mountains, in an industrial city and in the air overhead, with the units involved being mostly of battalion or company size (roughly 100 men per strength point), with naval units representing one ship or two boats, and air units each representing ten aircraft.&#10;&#10;There are some unusual concepts in the game system, as well as a considerable amount of detail.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: Impulses = 4-5 hours, 5-6 impulses per day&#10;Hex: 880 yards / 804 meters&#10;Units: Company to Regiment&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheet&#10;Two dual-side printed countersheets (1 combat, 1 markers - 600 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 40-page Black Sea - Black Death rules booklet&#10;Two Player Aid cards (in rules booklet)&#10;One 4-page Charts &amp; Tables booklet (in rule booklet)&#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;Players: 1 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2-20 hours&#10;Complexity: Medium&#10;Solitaire Suitability: Moderate&#10;&#10;";1982;7.32462;3.9167;2;4;360;12;Wargame, World War II

5755;Guadalcanal;"Guadalcanal is a hex based simulation of the land battle of Guadalcanal from August, 7 1942 through January 29, 1943, with battalion-sized units and a map scale of approximately one mile per hex. The naval and aerial combat that surrounded Guadalcanal are assumed to have their historical results so only historical reinforcements are available.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Basic Game&quot; introduced the components: the map board, unit counters, victory conditions, movement, zones of control, and combat.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Tournament Game&quot; the effects of different terrain types, reduction of units due to combat rather than wholesale elimination, ranged artillery fire, and point-based victory conditions.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Optional Rules&quot; introduced hidden movement, supply rules, different ranges for different artillery units based on their historical composition, withdrawing units from the island, and specialized capabilities for amphibious tractor and engineer units. Records for step reduction were kept on paper side records, rather than using reduced units (as in Anzio: The Struggle for Italy &#226;&#128;&#147; 1943-1945); records for hidden movement were also kept on paper, rather than using screens to hide each player's view of the opponent's forces as in Midway.&#10;&#10;The game victory conditions in the basic game were that the United States won if the Japanese were unable to hold Henderson Field for two consecutive turns between the September 25 and November 20 turns, inclusive, with the game ending on November 20 turn. The Tournament Game extended until the January 29, 1943 turn, with the point-based victory determined based on points awarded for eliminating enemy combat factors, occupying Henderson Field, or (for the Japanese) having Henderson Field in range of their artillery units.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill discontinued the game before assigning it a complexity rating; however, in the  Avalon Hill &#039;&#039;General&#039;&#039;, Volume 3, Number 6, Avalon Hill assigned to the game the following characteristics:&#10;&#10;     Playing Time: 2-4 hours&#10;     Play Balance: Even&#10;     Complexity: Very Complex&#10;     For Beginner: Very Poor&#10;     Play-By-Mail: Poor&#10;     Suggestion: Use of Optional Rules&#10;&#10;&#10;The rules were revised to a small extent in their second printing in June, 1966.

The numbers are shown multiple times on the cards in different colours.  These colours correspond to a specific category of questions including &quot;Famous Martyrs, Saints and Sinners&quot; and &quot; History - Pre Vatican II&quot;. The number also corresponds to the level of difficulty of the question, that range from Easy to Extremely Difficult. If a player correctly answers the question, he/she places a token on the number and colour that was answered. If not, play passes to the next person. A roll of a 6 is a &quot;free will&quot; where a player may select whichever space wanted.&#10;&#10;The player wins with 5 tokens in a row, vertically or horizontally.&#10;&#10;";1985;5.0;0.0;2;12;60;8;Religious, Trivia

5782;Coloretto;"Game play in Coloretto is simple: Either draw a card to play to a row, or take a row of cards to add them to your collection. A row can have at most three cards, so at some point everyone is forced to take a row. Once all the rows have been claimed, players start a new round, drawing or taking once again.&#10;&#10;What are you trying to do with these cards? Collect huge sets - but only in three colors as every color beyond the third will cost you points. Jokers are highly-prized as they always match what you want, and +2 cards provide sure points, giving you a back-up plan if everything goes south in terms of the colors you're collecting.&#10;&#10;Once only a few cards remain in the deck, the round ends and everyone tallies their score, choosing three colors of cards to score positively while any other colors count against you. Each color is scored using a triangular number system: the first card in a color is &plusmn;1 point, the second card is &plusmn;2 points, and so on. The player with the high score wins!&#10;&#10;A two-player variant is included with some versions of Coloretto, with the only change being that rows can have only 1-3 cards placed in them, depending on the icons on the row cards.&#10;&#10;Nordic version include extensions: 'Coloretto: The Extra Cards', 'Coloretto: The Limit Cards' and 'Coloretto for two players'.&#10;&#10;";2003;6.98071;1.272;2;5;30;8;Animals, Card Game

5784;Polterdice;"Polterdice is set in a haunted mansion in which treasures have been stashed away by ghosts.&#10;&#10;Players move their men (&quot;meeples&quot;, if you will) up sets of stairs hoping to be the first to reach the top of the staircase.  Which staircases you can move up and how much you can move are determined by rolling 8 dice and combining them into pairs.  When one of a player's men reaches the top of a staircase, he gets treasure as well as the option of challenging the Polterdice (ghosts of the former inhabitants of the mansion whom you must &quot;capture&quot; for additional treasure) for more money.  If he loses the challenge, it goes to the next player on the staircase and so-on until someone wins or everyone loses.  The key mechanic is deciding how to &quot;spend&quot; your dice rolls on which men in which part of the mansion.&#10;&#10;The designers note that the game is inspired by Can't Stop, and is therefore dedicated to Sid Sackson (who died during the production of the title).&#10;&#10;";2003;4.62053;1.3333;2;5;60;10;Dice

5791;Maelstrom;"This game was originally published in the summer of 2001 as collectible game &quot;Vortex&quot;, and was promoted with free demo-kits distributed to the hobby industry in the spring of 2001. &quot;Vortex&quot; used a clever connected-hexagons-as-board game system that would later inspire other games in the &quot;hexagon mass as a board&quot; category.&#10;&#10;From the FFG Website:&#10;&#10;Maelstrom is a fixed, stand-alone 2-4 player board game that contains every common and starter flat from the Vortex fantasy battle game - 54 flats in all, over 150 tiles. Maelstrom is the perfect way for strategy board gamers who don't like collectibility to experience the game, and is an ideal way for Vortex fans to fill out their collections.&#10;&#10;The Masters of the Void are at war. Using the powers of the Vortex, they tear holes in the fabric of existence, recruiting powerful allies and enslaving lands, cities, and beasts of the wild. Magic, creatures of unimaginable power, and engines of destruction are bound to the Vortex and equally engulfed in the bitter struggle between the Masters.&#10;&#10;Designed by Diskwars creators Tom Jolly and Christian T. Petersen, Maelstrom is a game of fantasy battles, magic, and resource management using a unique hexagonal tile game field that grows as players add allies, land, and relics to fill the void that surrounds the Vortex. Game play is fast and furious, as players seek to gain mastery over the battlefield, shaping the very foundation of the Vortex with each strategically placed tile. Only one can rule the void. Will you?&quot;&#10;&#10;This is the game Vortex, packaged in a non-collectible format.  The box contains a ton of tiles.  Vortex includes 92 &quot;flats&quot; of tiles total (16 &quot;fixed&quot;, 38 &quot;standard&quot;, and 38 &quot;rare); this box contains all of the fixed and standard flats (for a total of 54 flats).  Note that events and relics are not included in this game, as they are in Vortex (all events and relics are rare).  Otherwise, it's the same game as Vortex, and you can even add Vortex booster packs to this game to increase your collection.  That having been said, you really don't need to.  Events DO add to the game experience, but they're not necessary -- this is a complete game without any further purchases.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Maelstrom Expansion Pack&#10;&#10;&#10;";2001;6.58404;2.5667;2;4;60;12;Collectible Components, Fantasy
5792;Movie Moguls;"This game is similar to a bare bones version of Traumfabrik in that you're collecting movie stars to finish movies. It's also very Monopoly like.&#10;&#10;It's based on 20 movie productions. Players take turns moving around the board and have the option to buy various productions of older movies like Casablanca, High Noon, or A Streetcar Named Desire. There are title cards to represent ownership, with a list of three actors on them.

5816;Archegona;"Board games (petties) have been played in most cultures and societies throughout history; some even pre-date literacy skill development in the earliest civilizations. A number of important historical sites, artifacts and documents exist which shed light on early board games.&#10;&#10;Ancient Greeks always played the ancient board game (petteies) with the name &quot;Pessoi&quot; and Atherma Archegona is the recreation of this ancient board game.&#10;&#10;This is a game from ancient Hellas with boards found dating to about 15.000 B.C. and it is for 2-6 players. Each player has their own pawns. Pawns must have the signs of ancient Greek letters. There are also three dice with ancient Greek shapes on them.&#10;&#10;The player with the highest die roll plays first. All pawns entering the board must make a word.&#10;&#10;";2002;7.0;0.0;2;6;60;0;Ancient, Dice, Educational, Memory, Number
5817;The Con Game;"The Con Game is a game of game design where players attempt to break into the satirical, cutthroat, and potentially humourous world of game manufacturing.&#10;&#10;Players design games (by placing a 'game' card on their production track), find distributors, place games in the market, make deals, and attend Conventions.&#10;&#10;Depending on the quality (High, Average, or Cheesy) of the game and when it hits the market, money is earned... minus any distribution fees, of course. Getting to a Convention (between the Summer and Fall turns) requires a vote... the player with the most money gets two votes, the player with the least money gets no votes at all.  A player may only ever bring three games to a single Con. Players start out with anywhere from $2,500 to $10,000 depending on whether they are doing this part-time or not.&#10;&#10;The first player to reach $100,000 wins.  The game may also end after the 20th turn, in which case the player with the greatest net worth is the winner.&#10;&#10;";1989;6.08333;2.3333;2;6;60;0;Humor, Negotiation
5818;Waving Hands;"This unique and cunning pencil and paper game features a magical duel between 2 wizards.  Variants for more are easily devised (last wizard standing, teams, etc.).&#10;&#10;The two opponents perform 6 magical gestures with their hands to cast spells - each spell created by performing a specific sequence of gestures.  As gestures for the 2 hands are written secretly, then revealed simultaneously, there is ample ground for feinting - starting a sequence leading to a certain attack, then switching to a different sequence, hoping your opponent doesn't call your bluff.&#10;&#10;The 40 different spells allow you to attack, defend, summon monsters, enchant your opponent (limit her play in different ways), and more.&#10;&#10;To win, you need to make creative use of the many options, and keep an open eye towards your opponent's schemes.  This is a game of almost pure skill.&#10;&#10;The inventor wishes to state that he has never been involved in a magical duel but would be interested to discover how realistic the game is for those who have been involved in such a bout.&#10;&#10;";1977;7.43208;2.7778;2;10;30;8;Fantasy

Each player roll dice and moves to a city that matches one of his News cards to score the news story and gain points... each story is worth from 10 to 25 points.&#10;&#10;Whenever double six is rolled on the dice, a Headline card (50 points) is drawn, which goes to the player who gets to the city first.  Once four Headline cards have been 'captured', the next card flipped is a Scoop (100 points).

Each piece moves by roll of a different colored set of dice, each slightly weighted either high (for the Godfather) or low (for the Soldiers).&#10;&#10;By collecting 'bounty' after making a hit, or transporting a briefcase to the 'transaction area', a player earns money.

Proper allocation of the limited air and naval support is just as important as deciding manpower assignments. Both sides have opportunities to make numerous decisions affecting the outcome of the campaign. For the Allied commander, deciding where and when to commit the small but powerful BEF in 1940 is a choice as difficult as that facing the Axis commander concerning his limited panzer forces in 1944.&#10;&#10;Units are Corps, Divisions, and Brigades.

5826;Victory in the West: Plan Yellow, The French Campaign 1940;"Victory in the West: Plan Yellow, The French Campaign 1940, is a realistic two-player game that accurately recreates the 1940 campaign in all its aspects except one: the outcome is totally up to you. The game's centerpiece is an options system that lets the Allied player trade Victory Points for changes to his armies and policies that might (or might not) have changed history. Can you, as the Allied commander, repel the Germans with the forces on hand in 1940? How about if you train them better? Or give them a better command structure? Or provide them with more and better anti-aircraft an anti-tank guns? What do you think is the key to victory in the west? Can you, as the German commander, still beat the Allies if the French Army is motorized like the BEF? And how does your strategy change if the French don't build their Maginot Line, but do build a bigger and better air force? Do you still try to sneak through the Ardennes forest with your Panzers? Or do you ignore Allied bombers and wheel across the open plains of northern Belgium in a repeat of the 1914 Schlieffen Plan? Or do you do the unexpected and land a left hook through the Alsace? Your commanders await your orders. The future of Europe is in your hands.&#10;&#10;10 May, 1940 ... The German Wehrmacht opened its long-awaited campaign in the West by smashing across the frontiers of Belgium and Holland. For the German High Command, it was seen as a daring move. Hitler's fledgling legions faced the combined armies of France, Britain, Belgium and the Netherlands. These Allied forces had more and better weapons of almost every type, and at least two of the opposing armies, those of France and Britain, were considered to be the best in the world. The Germans had the element of surprise and the new Blitzkrieg tactics of mobile warfare.&#10;&#10;Six weeks later, it was all over. The British Expeditionary Force (BEF) had been driven from the continent and the French, Belgians, and Dutch had all capitulated. Hitler had achieved a victory in the west, and the world would never be the same.&#10;&#10;But, what if? It didn't have to happen that way ... Bad generalship and correctable flaws in their armies hastened the Allied defeat. What if the High Command had bothered to stay in radio contact with its armies on the frontier? And had then reacted promptly to the developing situation? What if the Maginot Line had been extended to cover the Meuse crossings at Sedan where Guderian's Panzers broke into the Allied rear? What if the BEF had included a strong British mobile corps that could have fought Rommel's Panzers on even terms at Arras? What if the French had prepared to meet the Blitzkrieg by building eight tank divisions instead of three? Or by mechanizing their cavalry the way the Germans did after the Polish campaign? Or even by developing their own blitzkrieg doctrine? The Allies could have taken any or all of these actions, and any of them would have altered the campaign's course. But which ones would have changed the outcome?&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 2 days&#10;Hex: 6.8 miles / 11 kilometer&#10;Units: Battalion to Army&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheet&#10;One 17 x 22&quot; full color mapsheet&#10;Three dual-side printed countersheets (720 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 32-page Victory in the West rulebook&#10;One 8-page Victory in the West Example of Play booklet&#10;One 4-page Victory in the West Design Notes booklet&#10;Five dual-side printed Player Aid Cards&#10;One 10-sided dice&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2-20 hours&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: David James Ritchie&#10;DEVELOPER: Kevin Boylan and Gene Billingsley&#10;ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

5844;Mystic Skull: The Game of Voodoo;"Imagine yourself a 'witch doctor' who can cast a hex. Each witch doctor tries to fill his opponents' voodoo dolls with pins while trying to keep his own from being filled.&#10;&#10;By stirring the cauldron with the bone, the mysterious moving Mystic Skull will magically stop at the various voodoo segments around the board, directing you to place pins in your opponent's voodoo doll or to exchange one of your tokens in order to remove pins from your own doll.&#10;&#10;Players should use their tokens wisely and to their best advantage--they may help a player eliminate an opponent or save himself, but when a player uses his tokens up, he is at the mercy of the other players. When a player's doll is filled with pins, he is considered to be under a spell, and is out of the game.&#10;&#10;The last player whose doll still has empty pin holes in it is the winner.&#10;&#10;";1964;6.32143;1.0;2;4;30;0;Children's Game, Horror
5846;Screw the Workers;"Each player is the Chief Executive Officer of a high-tech company.  Each turn, players may trade, pay their salary, play up to two cards, pay old and new workers, and re-draw up to four cards.  Then the Economic Index is adjusted, and all companies are payed based upon the overall state of the economy and the ability to control monopolies.  Cards include a variety of companies, boom and bust, changes in the labor pool, accounting scams, anti-trust and stocks.&#10;&#10;Because it is possible for all players to lose, some cooperation is necessary within an overall competitive framework.  Although the Economic Index may seem at first to dispense its rewards and penalties equally, clever players will soon find that they can manipulate it to their advantage.  Similarly, while supply and demand regulates the availability of labor, there is room for maneuvering as players strive to pay workers as little as possible while avoiding having the workers stolen away by higher-paying rivals.  As Chief Executive Officers players can name their own salary, but if they raise it too far too fast they will soon find their company in economic trouble.&#10;&#10;Game play basically falls into two parts; early, the players control small startup companies and maneuver to build them into large corporate entities.  In the game's late stages, great manipulation is possible, and excellent timing necessary, as each player struggles to amass the greatest personal fortune possible without going to jail, and to end the game at the perfect moment.&#10;&#10;The game takes 2-5 players and usually lasts from one to two hours.&#10;&#10;";2001;5.83333;2.0;2;5;90;12;Card Game, Economic, Humor, Industry / Manufacturing, Negotiation

5866;REACT-OR;"This game was developed on the heels of the Three Mile Island nuclear disaster in Pennsylvania.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to be the player with the least amount of radiation (identified in millirems or &quot;Mr&quot;) when the nuclear reactor is brought to a cold shutdown.&#10;&#10;The players, in some ways, represent water being cycled through the &quot;cooling loops&quot; of the nuclear power plant in an effort to reduce their radioactivity.&#10;&#10;Each player starts out with 180 Mr of radiation identified by Mr cards in 10, 20, 50 and 100 Mr values. Card hands are kept secret - an important feature of the game. Radiation is reduced by 100 Mr with each completed circuit of the Cooling Tower loop, the longest of the three loops. While traveling through the loops, the player lands on Operation spaces and Mr spaces. The Operational spaces allow players to draw operation cards which might help to reduce their millirems, cause them to lose a turn, or increase/decrease the temp in the reactor core. Mr spaces add radiation to the player's hand.&#10;&#10;Player's may also draw operation valve cards or other cards that might help them to effect a cold shutdown on the reactor. Valve cards prevent other players from moving around the loop. The challenge is in knowing when to shut down the reactor based on what you know about the other players' hands. Of course, the possibility also exists that the core temperature will rise to a meltdown point, which will also end the game.&#10;&#10;";1979;0.0;0.0;2;4;45;0;Environmental

Legal actions include body, hand, and foot checks, passes, and actual goal shots.  Illegal actions, or actions requiring a penalty check, include striking with the ball or elbow, shooting the player with the ball, and all-out assaults.  The usual result of such body contact is a high player turnover rate.  The player's body armor does not guarantee physical safety from opposing players or from the ball itself.  If the game gets too rough or a fight occurs, Heartless Huey is released.  This invulnerable robot will incapacitate the nearest player.

Like Bingo, one may win by matching all of the fields on the grid-card, or by matching a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line.

There are some additional ways to make money such as mines and special side tracks on the board.  Additional mechanics are mostly combat-related - players start with fighters and may buy frigates and battlecruisers.  Players may fight each other or the fleets of the Empire, which is a neutral party that moves around the board taxing players (although players may take their fleets over sometimes, apparently - the rules are very hard to follow).&#10;&#10;The box says it can be played by up to 12 people, but only 4 pawns are provided (and fighters come in just 3 colors - but organization does not seem to be the publisher's strong point).

5929;Clash of Empires: The Battle for France 1914;"Clash of the Empires: August 1914, first published in The Wargamer Magazine (#58), is a board-wargame simulation of the beginning of the Great War.  Basically a two-player game where one person controls the French and the other, the Germans (a third player can be brought in to control British forces).&#10;&#10;The game is open-ended... it continues until one side of the conflict has achieved its victory conditions or a stalemate is reached.  To win as the German player you must capture Paris and cut it off from supply for two complete turns.  The French must capture two German supply centres to win.  Either player may declare a Stalemate if the game lasts longer than 12 turns... a 'marginal' victory may then be calculated based on city control and strength losses.&#10;&#10;";1986;6.89265;2.2727;2;3;120;12;Wargame, World War I

5941;Mermaid Rain;"Mermaid Rain is a Japanese game from the makers of Train Raider.&#10;&#10;Over five rounds, players try to collect five different types of goods by moving around the sea. The game uses two phases: first is the &quot;surf predicting&quot; phase where players play melds of cards in a Taj Mahal-type mechanic. The melds determine player order, selection of &quot;wave tile&quot;, and give other benefits. In the second phase, &quot;surf riding&quot;, players place their wave tiles on the board and then use cards to move through the sea on the waves to collect goods.&#10;&#10;The game is playable with English rules as the components are either language-independent or easily decipherable.&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;Setup: specific locations for subset of tiles, some face down; rest are to side, also face down. Deal out 7 cards (3 suits).&#10;&#10;Each round, players simultaneously select a card to play (max 5 cards total) -- choose the pass card to pass for rest of round. The resulting poker-style combinations give bonuses (VP, or special powers); the ranking gives you player order for the round.&#10;&#10;In order, select a face up sea tile (4 shapes, 2-3 hexes each, with one of 3 suits or wild). Then, in order, place the tile on the board and use some/all cards left in hand to move your mermaid around the board (playing card allows you to move mermaid to matching tile/space). Whenever on an island with token(s), look at face down tokens then add one of the tokens to your collection.&#10;&#10;At end of round, sea tiles with the darker color are removed from the board. Any mermaids on them are displaced to one of the unoccupied starting locations (player's choice). Then, deal 7 cards per player (max hand size 9) and repeat.&#10;&#10;Game ends after 5 rounds. Each player must discard 5 tokens (1 per symbol), or lose 5 VP per missing symbol. Then rank players' collections of sets of each type, awarding VP accordingly (rarer tiles, larger sets earn more VP). Most VP wins.&#10;&#10;";2003;6.24436;2.2;3;6;45;10;Exploration

5951;Crazy Climber;"Based on the arcade game of the same name.&#10;&#10;There is the peril that people seem to drop just about anything out their windows at random times. Each card allows you to move to a particular position relative to where you currently are (for example, a choice of straight up two squares or up two squares and left or right one). However, there must be an open window that is not occupied by another player for it to be a legal move.

There is also a gorilla that knocks you all the way down if you're unfortunate enough to be hit by him.&#10;&#10;First one to get to the top of the building and escape on the helicopter wins.&#10;&#10;";1981;5.77778;2.0;2;6;30;8;Racing
