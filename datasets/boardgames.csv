1;Die Macher;"Die Macher is a game about seven sequential political races in different regions of Germany. Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The 1986 edition featured four parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players. The 1997 edition supports up to five players in the re-united Germany and updated several features of the rules as well.  The 2006 edition also supports up to five players and adds a shorter five-round variant and additional rules updates by the original designer.&#10;&#10;";1986;7.58934;4.3081
2;Dragonmaster;"Dragonmaster is a trick-taking card game based on an older game called Coup d'&#195;&#137;tat. Each player is given a supply of plastic gems, which represent points. Each player will get to be the dealer for five different hands, with slightly different goals for each hand. After all cards have been dealt out, the dealer decides which hand best suits his or her current cards, and the other players are penalized points (in the form of crystals) for taking certain tricks or cards. For instance, if &quot;first&quot; or &quot;last&quot; is called, then a player is penalized for taking the first or last tricks. All players will get a chance to be dealer for five hands, but other players can steal this opportunity by taking all of the tricks during certain hands. At the end, the biggest pile of gems wins the game.&#10;&#10;Jewel contents:&#10;&#10;10 clear (2 extra)&#10;14 green (2 extra)&#10;22 red (2 extra)&#10;22 blue (2 extra)&#10;&#10;";1981;6.65971;1.9643
3;Samurai;"Samurai is set in medieval Japan. Players compete to gain the favor of three factions: samurai, peasants, and priests, which are represented by helmet, rice paddy, and Buddha figures scattered about the board, which features the islands of Japan. The competition is waged through the use of hexagonal tiles, each of which help curry favor of one of the three factions &mdash; or all three at once! Players can make lightning-quick strikes with horseback ronin and ships or approach their conquests more methodically. As each figure (helmets, rice paddies, and Buddhas) is surrounded, it is awarded to the player who has gained the most favor with the corresponding group.&#10;&#10;Gameplay continues until all the symbols of one type have been removed from the board or four figures have been removed from play due to a tie for influence.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players compare captured symbols of each type, competing for majorities in each of the three types. Ties are not uncommon and are broken based on the number of other, &quot;non-majority&quot; symbols each player has collected.&#10;&#10;The game is part of what is sometimes called the Knizia tile-laying trilogy.&#10;&#10;";1998;7.47612;2.4423
4;Tal der KÃ¶nige;"When you see the triangular box and the luxurious, large blocks of Tal der K&ouml;nige (German: &quot;Valley of the Kings&quot;), you can tell this game was designed to be beautiful as well as functional.  The object of the game is to build pyramids out of the different colored blocks.  A pyramid scores more points when it's made from a few colors, but it's much harder to consistently outbid the other players for the necessary blocks.  The game is over when the Pharoah's Pyramid in the center is completed, which is built using all the blocks that the players don't use during the course of the game.&#10;&#10;Final round 1990 Hippodice Spieleautorenwettbewerb.&#10;&#10;";1992;6.6154;2.6875
5;Acquire;"In Acquire, each player strategically invests in businesses, trying to retain a majority of stock.  As the businesses grow with tile placements, they also start merging, giving the majority stockholders of the acquired business sizable bonuses, which can then be used to reinvest into other chains.  All of the investors in the acquired company can then cash in their stocks for current value or trade them 2-for-1 for shares of the newer, larger business.  The game is a race to acquire the greatest wealth.&#10;&#10;History of Acquire: This Sid Sackson classic has taken many different forms over the years depending on the publisher, yet the rules and game play have stayed the same. The 1966 version of the 3M bookshelf edition included rules for a 2-player variant. The original version is part of the 3M Bookshelf Series.&#10;&#10;Many books and websites incorrectly list this as a 1962 publication as the 3M Company used previously copyrighted artwork when they released the game in 1964. 3M actually received the idea for the game of &quot;Vacations&quot; from Sid Sackson in May of 1963 and decided to take his idea and put it into artwork they had developed the year before for a game called &quot;ACQUIRE.&quot; 3M's original game idea for a game called ACQUIRE must not have been very good so they decided to take Sid's idea of Vacations and put it into their concept of ACQUIRE. They released some limited test market games in 8 Midwestern U.S. cities in December of 1963 with a box that had a 1963 copyright. These games had Sid's original rules. When 3M released the mass market games in 1964, they had developed some of Sid's original ideas and changed some rules and game play to match their production desires. They released them with outer boxes that were copyrighted 1962 and inner boxes with rules that were dated 1963.&#10;&#10;December 1963 - Test Market World Map Wood Tile Edition&#10;1964 - Dated 1962/63 wood tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay &amp; stocks with printed backs&#10;1965 - Dated 1962/63 plastic tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay &amp; stocks with printed backs (last edition made with printed backs until 1999)&#10;1966 - Dated 1962/66 plastic tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay &amp; non-wax coated stocks (Only edition with these stocks)&#10;1968 - Dated 1968/66 plastic tiles, clear plastic board with paper underlay (Both 1966 inner box games have a lot of mixed parts)&#10;1971 - Dated 1968/71 plastic tiles, yellow hard plastic board&#10;1975 - 3M sells rights for game of ACQUIRE to the Avalon Hill Company&#10;1976 - Dated 1976 plastic tiles, yellow hard plastic board, redesigned money, no inner box (This edition was also produced in 1977, 79, 81, 82,       &amp; 86)&#10;1989 - Dated 1976 Gray box edition with new box artwork same contents as regular 1976 editions (This edition was also produced in 1992)&#10;1995 - Dated 1995 Large box cardboard edition with chipboard board and tiles, Special Powers Variant Tiles inspired by German editions&#10;1997 - Avalon Hill sells the rights to the game of ACQUIRE to Hasbro&#10;1999 - Dated 1999 Large box with large plastic board and tiles, 3D company buildings, redesigned stocks &amp; money, large info cards&#10;2006 - Hasbro assigns rights for the game of ACQUIRE to their subsidiary, Wizards of the Coast&#10;2006 - Lloyd's (private) Rules of ACQUIRE are made public, two major rule changes that help to bring the balance of the game of ACQUIRE back to the  intentions of Sid Sackson's original ideas.

It contains modified rules and a slightly smaller playing grid. Although these changes have been criticised for not ultimately improving upon Sackson's original design, they are generally regarded as not being too damaging to it.&#10;2023 - Renegade Game Studio partners with Hasbro, and releases their new version, with Classic Mode or Tycoon Mode &mdash; play with or without tertiary stockholder merger bonus. &#10;2024 - The Renegade 60th Anniversary edition includes a set of plastic weighted poker chips, and Special Powers Variant cards.&#10;&#10;";1964;7.35072;2.4923
6;Mare Mediterraneum;"In the ancient lands along the Mediterranean, players attempt to satisfy their unique victory conditions via trade, war and construction.  This lavishly produced game contains tons of wooden game components and a beautiful roll-out vinyl map.  Players produce a score of different commodities to trade with other cities in the hope of creating enough income to fill their capitals with buildings, produce artwork, and fill warehouses with goods.&#10;&#10;";1989;6.4523;3.0
7;Cathedral;"In Cathedral, each player has a set of pieces of a different color. The pieces are in the shapes of buildings, covering from one to five square units. The first player takes the single neutral Cathedral piece and places it onto the board. Players then alternate placing one of their buildings onto the board until neither player can place another building. Players capture territory by surrounding areas that are occupied by at most one opponent or neutral building. A captured piece is removed and captured territory becomes off-limits to the opponent. The player with the fewest 'square units' of buildings that can't be placed wins.&#10;&#10;";1979;6.54931;1.7887
8;Lords of Creation;"In this interesting offering from Warfrog, players become Gods seeking to dominate a world with their followers.  The first part of the game involves constructing the game board, after which players take turns using cards to determine how many new people should appear and what type of terrain they will inhabit.  All tribes start off as barbarians, but soon the calming effect of civilization settles the marauding bands; although civilized tribes score more, they can no longer attack.  What they can do, though, is civilize other players' followers.  Sure it gives opponents more points, but at least those followers won't come after you!&#10;&#10;";1993;6.05322;2.4
9;El Caballero;"Although referred to as a sequel to El Grande, El Caballero shares few aspects with its namesake, being a fun but intense brain-burner in which players explore and attempt to control the lands and waterways of the New World.&#10;&#10;The players are following Columbus by exploring the islands he discovered. Players slowly explore the islands &ndash; by picking and placing land tiles that are most favorable to them &ndash; and discover wealth in the form of gold and fish. As they learn about the land and sea areas of this new land, they position their caballeros to try to maintain control of the important regions. Castillos give them a measure of protection from others, and ships allow them to establish trade and to fish for food. Success is measured in the size of land and sea areas they control. Their success is measured twice, and in the end these scores are summed and the winner declared.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.47043;2.9515
10;Elfenland;"Elfenland is a redesign of the original White Wind game Elfenroads.  The game is set in the mythical world of the elves.  A group of fledgling elves (the players) are charged with visiting as many of the twenty Elfencities as they can over the course of 4 rounds.  To accomplish the task they will use various forms of transportation such as Giant Pigs, Elfcarts, Unicorns, Rafts, Magic Clouds, Trollwagons, and Dragons.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:  Players begin in the Elf capitol, draw one face down movement tile, and are dealt eight transport cards and a secret 'home' city card that they must reach at the end of the 4th round or lose points for each city space away from 'home' they are at the end of the game. Markers of each player's color are placed in each city on the board and are collected when the player visits that city (each counts as 1 point).&#10;  &#10;     The round proceeds in 2 stages.  The first part of the round consists of the drawing of Tiles showing the differing types of transport (except rafts) from a combination of face up and face down tiles (if a player doesn't like the 5 tiles that are face up; they can always draw blind from the face down tiles and hope to get one they need).  These transport tiles need to match the Transportation cards in your hand to use them most effectively.  After each player has a total of 4 tiles they take turns placing a tile on any one of the roads that run between the elf cities.  Only one transport tile may be placed on each road; so players may use other players tiles to travel if they have the matching cards in their hand.  This frequently causes a readjustment of planned travel routes as other players tiles can allow you to move farther or shorter than you had first thought.  Players can play their tiles to help themselves or hinder others by playing a slow mode of transport on another players (perceived) path.&#10;&#10;Each mode of transport has certain terrain it can travel through quickly or slowly, and those that it cannot. These are listed on the top of each transportation card by the number terrain symbols.  The number of terrain symbols equals how many matching cards you must play to move across a given tile in a given terrain.  For example, a Magic Cloud tile placed in a mountain would take one Magic cloud card to travel across (1 mountain symbol on card means Magic clouds are fast in mountains). If the same tile was placed on a road in forest terrain it would require 2 Magic Cloud cards to travel that route (2 Forest symbols on card means Magic Clouds are slow in Forest).  Magic Clouds cannot travel in desert terrain at all (no desert symbols on card). All modes of transport are different and Rafts can be used on rivers or lakes without needing tiles. Rafts go slow upstream (2 raft cards needed) and fast downstream (1 card needed).  The small lake requires 1 raft card to travel across and the larger lake requires 2 cards to travel across.  Players may keep one unused transport counter and up to 4 Transportation cards from one round to the next.&#10;&#10;The second part of the round begins after all players have finished placing their transportation tiles for the round.  Each player plays his cards and moves his elf-boot around the board collecting his tokens from the cities visited.  If there is a Transport tile on a route and a player has no matching Transportation card he may 'Caravan' across it by playing any 3 Transportation cards from his hand.&#10;&#10;As a bit of 'take that' each player has a trouble tile which can be placed next to any transportation tile during the first part of the round.  This counter means that in order to travel that path an additional card of the transport type must be played or 4 cards to 'Caravan'.&#10;&#10;Victory: if at the end of round 3 a player has visited all 20 cities he is the winner.  If not the game ends after round 4 when 'Home' cities are revealed and each player subtracts points for each city he is away from his 'home' subtracting that from his collected city tokens.  The person with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.67173;2.1511
11;Bohnanza;"Bohnanza is the first in the Bohnanza family of games and has been published in several different editions, including a 2023 version with flowers.&#10;&#10;This entry lists a few different major card sets for Bohnanza: the base game for 3-5 players, the expanded game with the same name for 2-7 players (that is, first expansion included), and Bohnanza Pocket.&#10;&#10;In the game, you plant, then harvest bean cards in order to earn coins. Each player starts with a hand of random bean cards, and each card has a number on it corresponding to the number of that type of beans in the deck. Unlike in most other card games, you can't rearrange the order of cards in hand, so you must use them in the order that you've picked them up from the deck &mdash; unless you can trade them to other players, which is the heart of the game.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you must plant the first one or two cards in your hand into the &quot;fields&quot; in front of you. Each field can hold only one type of bean, so if you must plant a type of bean that's not in one of your fields, then you must harvest a field to make room for the new arrival. This usually isn't good! Next, you reveal two cards from the deck, and you can then trade these cards as well as any card in your hand for cards from other players. You can even make future promises for cards received right now! After all the trading is complete &mdash; and all trades on a turn must involve the active player &mdash; then you end your turn by drawing cards from the deck and placing them at the back of your hand.&#10;&#10;When you harvest beans, you receive coins based on the number of bean cards in that field and the &quot;beanometer&quot; for that particular type of bean. Flip over 1-4 cards from that field to transform them into coins, then place the remainder of the cards in the discard pile. When the deck runs out, shuffle the discards, playing through the deck two more times. At the end of the game, everyone can harvest their fields, then whoever has earned the most coins wins.&#10;&#10;The original German edition supports 3-5 players. The English version from Rio Grande Games comes with the first edition of the first German expansion included in a slightly oversized box. One difference in the contents, however, is that bean #22's Weinbrandbohne (Brandy Bean) was replaced by the Wachsbohne, or Wax Bean. This edition includes rules for up to seven players, like the Erweiterungs-Set, but also adapts the two-player rules of Al Cabohne in order to allow two people to play Bohnanza.&#10;&#10;";1997;7.06976;1.6677
12;Ra;"Ra is an auction and set-collection game with an Ancient Egyptian theme.  Each turn players are able to purchase lots of tiles with their bidding tiles (suns).  Once a player has used up his or her suns, the other players continue until they do likewise, which may set up a situation with a single uncontested player bidding on tiles before the end of the round occurs.  Tension builds because the round may end before all players have had a chance to win their three lots for the epoch.  The various tiles either give immediate points, prevent negative points for not having certain types at the end of the round (epoch), or give points after the final round.  The game lasts for three &quot;epochs&quot; (rounds).  The game is easy to learn.&#10;&#10;From the Box:&#10;The game spans 1500 years of Egyptian history in less than an hour!&#10;The players seek to expand their power and fame and there are many ways to accomplish this: Influencing Pharaohs, Building monuments, Farming on the Nile, Paying homage to the Gods, Advancing the technology and culture of the people. Ra is an auction and set collecting game where players may choose to take risks for great rewards or... And all this is for the glory of the Sun God Ra!&#10;&#10;";1999;7.66581;2.3147
13;CATAN;"In CATAN (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine which resources the island produces. Players build structures by 'spending' resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) which are represented by the relevant resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore, fields produce wheat, and pastures produce sheep.&#10;&#10;Set-up includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each depicting one of the five resource-producing terrain types--or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. A number disk, the value of which will correspond to the roll of two 6-sided dice, are placed on each terrain tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are placed on intersections and borders of the terrain tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which terrain tiles their last-placed settlement is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of rolling the dice, collecting resource cards based on this dice roll and the position of settlements (or upgraded cities&mdash;think: hotels), turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, possibly playing a development card, or trading resource cards with other players. If the dice roll is a 7, the active player moves the robber to a new terrain tile and steals a resource card from another player who has a settlement adjacent to that tile.&#10;&#10;Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road or the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), s/he announces this and claims the win.&#10;&#10;";1995;7.09402;2.2876
14;Basari;"Basari is a game of gem merchants competing in a marketplace&quot;: racing, collecting, trading, and predicting what the other merchants will do.&#10;&#10;To start the game, players receive 12 gemstones (3 each of 4 colors). &#10;Each turn there will be a movement phase and an action phase:&#10;&#10;For movement, everyone simultaneously rolls their die and moves their markers around a track.&#10;&#10;They then choose one of three different actions to perform. The actions are:&#10;- to take a variety of gems from a market stall, &#10;- to immediately score from between 4 and 7 points, or &#10;- to roll and move again and also collect points.&#10;&#10;The action cards are revealed simultaneously. If only 1 player chose a particular action, they simply perform that action. If 2 players chose the same action, they barter back and forth with gemstones. One player will eventually accept the other's offer of gems, and the other will take the action. If 3 or 4 players all chose the same action card, that action is cancelled. Note that in 4-player games, there will always be a conflict in choice of 3 actions, so much more negotiating goes on.&#10;&#10;A new turn begins with everyone rolling their die, moving, then choosing and revealing their action cards. When any merchant piece completes a lap around the board, the round ends and bonus points are awarded based on who has the majority in each gem color and who has completed a lap. After three rounds, the game is over and the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Edel, Stein & Reich&#10;&#10;&#10;";1998;6.74612;1.8478
15;Cosmic Encounter;"By request of Fantasy Flight Games, Board Game Geek lists the various editions of Cosmic Encounter in separate entries. Each edition is the same game at its core, but the features, compatible expansions, and production differ among them. This entry is for the original 1977 Eon version.&#10;&#10;Players represent alien races that are seeking to spread themselves onto five foreign worlds.  To accomplish this, they make challenges against other players and enlist the aid of interested parties.  But alien powers, which are unique to each race, give players ways to bend or outright break some rule in the game.&#10;&#10;The game continues until one player occupies five planets in other systems to win. Shared victories are possible and a player need not occupy one's own system to win.&#10;&#10;";1977;6.92506;2.3721
16;MarraCash;"Taking on the roles of shop owners in the Moroccan marketplace, players buy various shops, as color-coded tourists in the form of neat little wooden people in hats start showing up at the entry gate. Players can then move them into their own like-colored shops to earn money or move them into opponents' shops for a share of the profits. After all the tourists have been placed onto the board, the player with the biggest bankroll takes the victory.

17;Button Men;"This game gained a quick following after one of the major gaming conventions of 1999.  It features several characters, represented on actual stickpin buttons, that each have a unique allowance of polyhedral dice.  These dice endow each  character with fairly unique combat abilities.  Players roll the dice against each other and take their opponents' dice as casualties.  The object of the game is take out the most die 'sides' during the combat.  It's quite simple, quite inventive, and deeper than it would seem at first.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.36282;1.52
18;RoboRally;"The robots of the RoboRally automobile factory spend their weekdays toiling at the assembly line. They put in hard hours building high-speed supercars they never get to see in action. But on Saturday nights, the factory becomes a world of mad machines and dangerous schemes as these robots engage in their own epic race.It takes speed, wits, and dirty tricks to become a racing legend! Each player chooses a robot and directs its moves by playing cards. Chaos ensues as all players reveal the cards they've chosen. Players face obstacles like industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyor belts -- but those can also be used to their advantage! Each player aims to make it to each of the checkpoints in numerical order. The first player to reach all of the checkpoints wins. &#10;&#10;In RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.&#10;&#10;In general, players will first fill all of their robot's &quot;registers&quot; with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it!&#10;&#10;Robots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style.&#10;&#10;The game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in 2005.&#10;&#10;UPC 742818050029&#10;&#10;";1994;7.0506;2.4285
19;Wacky Wacky West;"A long time ago, in a village far, far away, some disturbed townsfolk decided to destroy their entire town in order to rid themselves of an evil menace (it's technically a dog-mouse, but I think it's an idiomatic thing).  Anyway, so the villagers rebuilt all the buildings in the town (including their precious outhouses), but forgot to include city walls, a river, or roads.  To rectify this, players lay tiles with one of these three things onto the board, and any building caught underneath them is automatically eliminated, except for outhouses.  When an outhouse would be destroyed, players take a vote on whether to place that particular section.  Each player is trying to retain the most of one type of building, and once all the pieces have been placed the winner is the person with the highest valued buildings still standing.&#10;&#10;Wacky, Wacky West re-make description:&#10;&#10;Fans of Klaus Teuber will be interested in this remake/redesign of Drunter und Dr&uuml;ber, a 1991 Spiel des Jahres winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;Just south of nowhere, there's the junction of the Mayfair &amp; Rossdorf RR and the Turvy Trunk Line. Springing up from the desert like a tumbleweed lies the eccentric little town of Rossdorf. Like most western towns, Rossdorf has a Land Agent: Guy Dough, the brother of that wicked varmint Black Benny. A shrewd opportunist, Guy's done sold all the town land ('ceptin' the outhouses) four times over! Every acre in town that ain't got an outhouse on it is owned by the miners, the railroads, AND the fort captain. Just about a year ago, miners digging in the shadow of Fort Rossdorf struck the mother lode! But it wasn't gold, and it wasn't silver. No, my friend, it was just a little spring. Not any ordinary spring, though! It was a torrent of that mind-marbling drink the locals call &quot;Wacky Water!&quot; &#10;&#10;&#10;Now that water's done what the sun and the wind couldn't do: it's made those landholders brave enough to take matters into their own hands. Now they'll use whatever means they can to bowl over the competition and lay claim to the only fertile spots left in town! Now the only thing stoppin' 'em is the Town Charter Amendment #5, which states: &quot;no landholder may move, remove, or detonate any outhouse without a majority vote of the Town Citizens...&quot; Now one thing's for sure: something's gonna stink in Rossdorf, purty darn soon.....&#10;&#10;&#10;In Wacky Wacky West you and your fellow townfolk place track tiles, street tiles, and river tiles hoping to destroy your rivals' buildings. Every time someone tries to build over a precious outhouse, the town votes! You try to enlist your supporters (represented by cards) to vote with you to stop or encourage the play of certain tiles-perhaps saving some of your buildings or taking out those of your dastardly opponents.&#10;&#10;";1991;6.27644;1.8204
20;Full Metal PlanÃ¨te;"In this game of science fiction strip mining, players land on a planet and try and grab as much ore as possible and take off before the game is over.  Each player has tanks, boats, barges, mining equipment and a base ship at his disposal and will have to contend with the weather and the other miners.  The game uses an action point allowance system and thus is dice free.  Each player on his turn has a pool of points that he can divide in a variety of ways, putting all the points into one unit's movement or dividing them among several units.  Each turn is timed so players have to think quickly, and once a move has been made it cannot be retracted.  The game itself is beautifully put together, with a detailed hex grid and real metal miniatures for all of the units.&#10;&#10;Online Play: &#10;&#10;    Full Metal Galaxy&#10;    Full Metal Program&#10;    VASSAL module&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Full Metal Conqu&#195;&#170;te (as a two-player version)&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Full Metal Planete: Plateau Modulaire.&#10;&#10;&#10;Microbadges:&#10; - Full Metal Plan&egrave;te fan  Buy It&#10;&#10;";1988;7.50139;3.1429

22;Magic Realm;"From the 2nd edition rulebook intro for MAGIC REALM:&#10;&#10;MAGIC REALM is a game of fantasy adventuring, set in a land filled with monsters, fabulous treasures, great warriors, and magicians. The scene is set in the ruins of a mighty kingdom, now inhabited by sparse groups of natives and swarms of monsters. Beneath it all are the rich remnants of a magical civilization, scattered and lost across the map.&#10;To this scene come the adventurers, seekers of riches and fame, to make a name for themselves in this promising field. Swordsman and Dwarf, Magician and Sorceror, the humans and the half-humans come seeking to loot the legendary riches of a lost civilization. Now you can play the part of one of these adventurers, stepping into an unknown Realm of magic and monsters, battles and treasures.&#10;&#10;As a player, you will take on the role of one of the sixteen major characters who are represented in detail in the game. You will control where he goes, what he tries to do, how he handles himself in combat, and much more. In the course of the game, you will run into deadly monsters, tribes of humans ranging from old friends to sworn enemies, and treasures that will enhance your abilities in many ways.&#10;&#10;MAGIC REALM is a complex game designed to recapture the suspense and desperate struggles of fantasy literature. The game creates a small but complete fantasy world, where each game is a new adventure with a new map where everything lies hidden at new locations. The game includes many more playing pieces than are actually used in a single playing. The additional pieces are set up and can appear, depending on the directions in which the characters explore, but many of the treasure troves, treasures, and spells will still be set up, unfound, when the game ends, and many of the monsters and natives might never be met. The result is an extremely unpredictable game full of surprises, a game that plays very differently each time it is played.&#10;The complete game system includes hiking, hiding and searching, fatigue, wounds, rest, trade, hiring natives, and combat between characters, monsters, and natives using a variety of weapons on horseback and afoot, as well as many magical effects.&#10;&#10;Between exploring a new land where the mountains, caves, valleys, and woods change every game, and not knowing what you will find in each place, you will find each game a new and unpredictable adventure, filled with surprises. You will find this like no other board game you have ever played.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 9&#10;&#10;See also the list of articles about Magic Realm in The General.&#10;&#10;";1979;7.29803;4.562
23;Divine Right;"Divine Right combines combat, diplomacy, and role-playing into 2-6 hours of fast-paced action as each player attempts to build and hold together an alliance of kings long enough to defeat the other players and win the game. The kingdoms of humans, elves, goblins, dwarves and trolls are pawns in the power games that absolute monarchs play. Ambassadors vie for the attention of the kings whose favor they curry. Assassination and backstabbing are popular pastimes, and loyal allies may leave your side in the heat of battle at the drop of a hat &mdash; or a die. The magicians, too, get their arcane fingers into things, and the gods intervene as well. It is a situation that demands skill and luck.&#10;&#10;The box contains rule book, full-color mapsheet, over 250 die-cut counters, dice, and cards.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Divine Right: Scarlet Empire&#10;&#10;&#10;";1979;7.2049;3.1688
24;Twilight Imperium;"Sprawling game of space faring races out to dominate known space.&#10;&#10;This game combines a number of elements from other game systems into a unique package. Hex tiles create the game board and each player begins with a race with unique powers. The game focuses heavily on a political voting phase and a web of trade agreements between players.&#10;&#10;&#10;Part of the Twilight Imperium Series / Family.&#10;&#10;Expanded with:&#10;&#10;    Twilight Imperium: Borderlands&#10;    Twilight Imperium: Distant Suns&#10;    Twilight Imperium: Twilight Armada&#10;    Twilight Imperium: The Outer Rim&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented in:&#10;&#10;    Twilight Imperium: Second Edition&#10;    Twilight Imperium: Third Edition&#10;    Twilight Imperium (Fourth Edition)&#10;&#10;&#10;";1997;6.59282;3.4643

A card driven system resolves players' quests.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Battlemist: The Sails of War&#10;&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;    Runewars&#10;&#10;&#10;";1998;5.89138;3.2
26;Age of Renaissance;"A game that is often described as a semi-sequel to Civilization.&#10;&#10;Players attempt to build up their cultures during the Middle Ages and Renaissance periods. The game features a card deck that holds events, payout cards, and famous leaders of the particular eras. Although all cards will turn up somewhere during the game, the timing and position in which they will be played is crucial and will ensure a different game every time.&#10;&#10;The main goal of each city-state is to gain points in the form of technical advances, while keeping their culture's misery level as low as possible. The payout structure is similar to those of Civilization and Advanced Civilization in that more resources of the same type yield increasingly higher payouts. This time particular payouts are triggered by card play for every player at once. An ingenious and very smooth working &ldquo;combat&rdquo; system is implemented to determine province &ndash; and thus resource - control.&#10;&#10;";1996;7.09318;3.8495

30;Dark Tower;"An epic fantasy quest to recover an ancient magic scepter from a tyrant king in his Dark Tower, brought to life in electronic form.&#10;&#10;To vanquish the usurper, players search the four realms of the circular game board for three keys to unlock the tower's gate.  On this journey, there are battles to be fought against roving bands of brigands, dragons, plague and hunger.  There are bazaars to visit to purchase supplies and assistants for the quest.  There are uncharted territories to get lost in and tombs and ruins to plunder.  And there is a mighty army to be raised before the player can lay siege to the tower and fight either to glorious victory or crushing defeat.&#10;&#10;Dark Tower was technologically impressive when it was released in 1981.  Gameplay was facilitated by a small computer inside the black plastic shell of the tower itself.  Players input their moves on a small membrane keypad each turn and the computer took over from there, doing everything from conducting the progress of battles to keeping track of how much (or little) food was left to feed the players' always hungry warriors. The computer would play brief musical serenades at significant points of the game.&#10;&#10;";1981;6.88766;1.802
31;Dark World;"Along the lines of HeroQuest comes a much more heavily produced game called Dark World. One player is the evil lord who controls the dungeon in which the rest of the players move their characters from room to room, fighting monsters and gaining treasure.

36;Federation & Empire;"This sprawling empire game is set in the  Star Fleet Universe. Players command one or more races in a variety of scenarios as they replay the &quot;historical&quot; situations in the galactic politics of the future.&#10;&#10;It is the base set for the Federation and Empire series of products.&#10;&#10;The Star Fleet Universe series is based on the game Star Fleet Battles, and Federation &amp; Empire is a strategic game based in that background.  Federation &amp; Empire is a stand alone game, and Star Fleet Battles is not required or needed to play this game.&#10;&#10;The two games are closely related, and Star Fleet Battles can be used to resolve some or all of the tactical battles of Federation &amp; Empire, and Federation &amp; Empire can be used as a campaign system for Star Fleet Battles.&#10;&#10;The original version came out in 1986, and was published by Task Force Games.  This was followed in 1990 with the &quot;Deluxe&quot; version, which replaced the original release.  &quot;Deluxe&quot; was indicated on the front of the box to indicate it was the new version.  The Deluxe version included a revised rule book, more counter sheets, and other player aids such as the battle board and player folio.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Deluxe&quot; version had three expansions:&#10;&#10;    Federation & Empire: Carrier War&#10;    Federation & Empire: F & E Module 1 &#226;&#128;&#147; Special Operations&#10;    Federation & Empire: F & E Module 2 &#226;&#128;&#147; Marine Assault&#10;&#10;&#10;In 2000, another revision of the rules was completed, and the F&amp;E 2K (as it is called) version stood for a decade.&#10;&#10;In 2010 the countersheets were entirely redone (with a larger number of counters per sheet) and the rulebook was once again revised to incorporate the last 10 years of errata and rulings, allowing a better integration with the expansions that were released during this period.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Federation & Empire: Advanced Operations&#10;    Federation & Empire: Combined Operations (combined and replaced Federation & Empire: F & E Module 1 &#226;&#128;&#147; Special Operations and Federation & Empire: F & E Module 2 &#226;&#128;&#147; Marine Assault)&#10;    Federation & Empire: Fighter Operations (replaced Federation & Empire: Carrier War)&#10;    Federation & Empire: Planetary Operations&#10;    Federation & Empire: Strategic Operations&#10;    Federation & Empire: ISC War&#10;    Federation & Empire: Minor Empires&#10;&#10;&#10;Since 2010 ADB has created, in both print and pdf form, Compendium I, II and III.

38;Runes;"Runes is a different kind of word game where players actually construct the letters with special game pieces.  Players attempt to figure out not simply the spelling but the actual letter structure of the hidden words.&#10;&#10;Players take turns putting one letter segment in a letter box on another player's board; they get a point if the segment belongs to that letter and the other player gets a point if it doesn't. When a player thinks they know an opponent's word they guess it and gain points equal to the number of segments in the word (or lose the points if they are incorrect).&#10;&#10;";1981;6.13689;1.9
39;Darkover;"Based on the books of Marion Zimmer Bradley this game melds your typical strategy game with what would normally be found in a party game.

41;Can't Stop;"In this Sid Sackson classic, players must press their luck with dice and choose combinations tactically to close out three columns. The board has one column for each possible total of two six-sided dice, but the number of spaces in each column varies: the more probable a total, the more spaces in that column and the more rolls it takes to complete. On their turn, a player rolls four dice and arranges them in duos: 1 4 5 6 can become 1+4 and 5+6 for 5 &amp; 11, 1+5 and 4+6 for 6 &amp; 10, or 1+6 and 4+5 for 7 &amp; 9. The player places or advances progress markers in the open column(s) associated with their chosen totals, then chooses whether to roll again or end their turn and replace the progress markers with markers of their color. A player can only advance three different columns in a turn and cannot advance a column which any player has closed out by reaching the end space; if a roll doesn&rsquo;t result in any legal plays, the turn ends with that turn&rsquo;s progress lost.&#10;&#10;A predecessor from 1974, The Great Races, exists as a paper-and-pencil game.&#10;&#10;";1980;6.92626;1.1442
42;Tigris & Euphrates;"Regarded by many as Reiner Knizia's masterpiece, Tigris &amp; Euphrates is set in the ancient fertile crescent with players building civilizations through tile placement. Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized. Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board, i.e., external conflicts, with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict. Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts.&#10;&#10;Starting in the Mayfair edition from 2008, Tigris &amp; Euphrates included a double-sided game board and extra components for playing an advanced version of the game. This &quot;ziggurat expansion&quot;, initially released as a separate item in Germany for those who already owned the base game, is a special monument that extends across five spaces of the board. The monument can be built if a player has a cross of five civilization tokens of the same color by discarding those five tokens and replacing them with the ziggurat markers, placing a ziggurat tower upon the middle tile. The five ziggurat markers cannot be destroyed. All rules regarding monuments apply to the ziggurat monument as well. If your king is inside the kingdom of the ziggurat, you will get one victory point in a color of your choice at the end of your turn.&#10;&#10;Some versions of Tigris &amp; Euphrates are listed as being for 2-4 players, while others incorrectly state that they're for 3-4 players. Tigris &amp; Euphrates is part of what is sometimes called Reiner Knizia's tile-laying trilogy.&#10;&#10;";1997;7.70242;3.4957
43;Airlines;"Airlines' theme is exactly as suggested by the title. The game is similar to the Sid Sackson classic, Acquire, in that players are competing to become majority stockholders in several highly-abstracted companies with the player owning the most valuable portfolio at the end being the winner.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player chooses from one of two actions: expand an airline and put stock into his hand, or play stock from his hand. Expanding an airline adds to its route(s) on the board and increases its value but the trick is that when a scoring card shows up (randomly), only played stock counts as a player's holdings.&#10;&#10;";1990;6.57678;2.4242
44;David & Goliath;"This game adds a very interesting twist to the standard trick-taking genre.  There are five suits and players must follow suit, if they can.  However, the winner of the trick is the highest card played, regardless of suit.  The winner gets all the cards from the trick, minus the card he won it with.  That card is given to the player that played the lowest card.  After all tricks have been played, the scoring begins.  Players score the face-value of the cards in the suits that they only collected one or two of, and one point per card for suits with more than two.  The player with the most points after a number of hands wins the game.&#10;&#10;";1997;6.49319;1.623
45;Perudo;"Liar's Dice, a.k.a. Bluff, Perudo or Dudo, is a South American dice game in which each player is given five dice and cup to roll and hide them with. Players make successively higher declarations regarding the results of all the dice remaining in the game, e.g. &quot;there are ten sixes&quot;. However, someone can always contest the bid. When that happens, all the dice are revealed and either the bidder or the caller loses dice, depending on who was correct. The last player with dice is the winner.&#10;&#10;As a public domain dice game, there are a number of variants or similar games called Liar's Dice. This includes one that is often played with Poker Dice, and differs from the marketed versions in that players only declare on their own hand's value (as opposed to all dice being in play), using poker-hand values.&#10;&#10;";1800;6.92206;1.252
46;Medici;"Another Reiner Knizia standby, this game plays very well with varying numbers of people.  The object is to accrue the most points during three rounds, which you do by spending your points to bid on sets of cards.  Each turn the current player turns up one to three cards for all the players to bid on, with the highest bid taking all cards.  The cards denote a commodity type and quantity/value.  The round ends when each player's ships are full, or the commodity card deck is exhausted.  After each round, points are awarded to each player having the most of a given commodity, and to the one with the most valuable total &quot;cargo load&quot;.&#10;&#10;Part of the Knizia auction trilogy.&#10;One of the Knizia Florentine auction games.&#10;&#10; Related Games: &#10;&#10;&#10;     Medici vs Strozzi (two-player version)&#10;     Strozzi&#10;     Mercator, included in Neue Spiele im alten Rom (ancestor to Medici).&#10;&#10;&#10;";1995;7.18278;2.2212
47;Chinatown;"This is a negotiation game in the truest sense of the word. In it, players acquire ownership of sections of city blocks then place tiles, representing businesses, onto the block-sections.  At the end of each turn, each tile you've laid gives you some sort of payout, but completed businesses (formed of three to six connected tiles of the same type) pay quite a bit better.  All these resources are dealt to the players randomly, however, so players must trade to get matching businesses and adjacent locations.&#10;&#10;This game is #2 in the Alea big box series.&#10;&#10;";1999;7.43721;2.2346
48;Krieg und Frieden;"Taking on the roles of land-owners in a feudal society, players are charged with running their lands and accruing favor from the bishop by building his cathedral.  Each turn, players use their resources to bid for that year's agenda, and some resources have more or less value in the bid depending on what type of agenda is available.  Then players use their remaining resources to build their lands, sack others' lands, bribe others' knights away from defense, or help to build the bishop's cathedral.  Finally, players harvest new resources for the next turn.  After all the pieces of the cathedral have been built, the game is over with the victory going to the player with the most victory points.  This game was originally released as Charlemagne by Think Games at Essen 1998, and later slightly shortened as Krieg und Frieden.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Charlemagne&#10;&#10;&#10;";1999;6.09079;2.4638
49;Mamma Mia!;"Designer Uwe Rosenberg has a talent for dreaming up new and inventive card games, and Mamma Mia! is a perfect example of this talent, with players placing pizza ingredients into a combined pool, then trying to time their pizza baking in order to make use of what's available in the kitchen.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with eight different pizza orders to fill, with one of those order cards in hand; each player also starts with a hand of ingredient cards (showing pepperoni, mushroom, pineapple, green pepper or olive). On a turn, a player lays down one or more ingredient cards of a single type into a common stack, then optionally adds a pizza order card to that stack. He then refills his hand by drawing as many cards as he played from either the shared ingredient deck or his own order deck.&#10;&#10;After the draw pile is exhausted, the shared pile of cards is flipped over and sorted by ingredients until an order comes up. If enough ingredient cards are available to fill that order, the owner scores it; if not, the player can make up the difference by playing cards from his hand (and thereby scoring the order) or else return the card to the bottom of his order deck.&#10;&#10;Once all the orders are scored or returned, shuffle the ingredients used in pizzas and start another round of play. After three complete rounds, the player who's filled the most orders wins!&#10;&#10;";1998;6.48076;1.362
50;Lost Cities;"Lost Cities is a card game in the Kosmos two-player series. The game originally consisted of a single deck of cards of rank 2&ndash;10 in five different colors with three special &quot;handshakes&quot; (&quot;HS&quot; in scoring examples below) in each suit, but as of 2018 the game now includes six colored suits, with the sixth color being optional for gameplay. A game board is included to organize discarded cards and help players organize their card collections.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the colored suits of cards. On a player's turn, they must first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the color-appropriate discard pile, then draw one card, either from the deck or from the top of a discard pile. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order, but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.&#10;&#10;The game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the deck. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total; one handshake doubles an expedition's value, while two handshakes triples that value and three handshakes quadruple it. Expeditions start at a value of -20, so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least eight cards played into it. A complete game of Lost Cities lasts three matches, with scores for each match being added together.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 1: An expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30. This expedition is worth 10 total points: 30 plus the initial -20.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 2: An expedition has 2 HS, and 4,5,6,7,8,10 for a total of 40. This expedition is worth 80 total points: 40 points for cards, plus the initial -20, &times;3 for the two multipliers, plus the 20-pt bonus for playing 8+ cards.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 3: An expedition has 1 HS, and 4,6,7 for a total of 17. This expedition is worth -6 total points: 17 plus the initial -20, &times;2 for the multiplier.&#10;&#10;";1999;7.24938;1.476
51;Ricochet Robots;"Ricochet Robots is less of a game and more of a puzzle, which explains why there's such an odd number of solutions possible. There's a four-piece modular board that forms a large room with walls spread around the board. There are also color-coded targets on boards. Placed on top of the surface are four robots. The idea for each turn/puzzle is to get the like-colored robot to a randomly selected target. The trick is that once a robot starts moving, it will continue to move until a wall or another robot stops it. Therefore, players are seeking a sequence of moves for the robots that will enable them to move the required robot to the target in the fewest moves.&#10;&#10;";1999;7.03449;2.3801
52;Mighty Empires;"Mighty Empires is both a strategic layer to the Warhammer Fantasy Battle (Third Edition) system and a boardgame in its own right.  It allows players of the miniature game to manage a kingdom, explore the world, and attempt to conquer other kingdoms, but it also can be played standalone as a fantasy wargame.  The game board is constructed with hexagonal tiles to create a unique land with mountains, hills, river valleys, lowlands, and coastal areas.

58;Kings & Things;"Kings &amp; Things is a classic Tom Wham game of warring kingdoms in a fantasy world and the legions of things that inhabit them.

59;Giganten;"Besides attempting to find oil in dusty Texas, players must also try to outbid one another for sales contracts in the oil industry.  An oilfield with drilling sites scattered about is spread out before the players, who take their trucks out trying to grab those sites as quickly as possible.&#10;&#10;Three groups of tiles are laid over the drilling sites, giving a range of value for each site once it has been reached by a player.  The deeper a site is into the field the greater its overall yield. But players have to weigh this against creating a constant supply from the smaller yields that are closer at the beginning of the game.&#10;&#10;Once oil has been produced, players can attempt to sell it on the market. But there are only three companies, and with four players this means that one player will be shut out each turn.  Bidding has an interesting element to it in that player's bidding pools are hidden from one another, making it difficult to tell whether a player is bluffing.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented as Black Gold&#10;&#10;";1999;6.69409;2.5693
61;Fossil;"On the hunt for petrified treasures, players are competing paleontologists trying to make as complete a set as possible of several fossils.  The board is laid out with a random bunch of fossil pieces and players have to take turns moving a stone about the field to a location where they want to pick up a fossil piece.  However, every movement costs them prestige points so they have to weigh carefully if the fossil is worth the effort.&#10;&#10;Won Games Magazine Game of the Year award in 1999.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.42226;1.75
63;Samurai: Game of Politics and Warfare in Feudal Japan;"(from the back of the box:)&#10;&#10;You are now back in time-12th through 17th century Japan, to be exact. Your objective: the exalted title of &quot;Shogun&quot;. As &quot;Shogun&quot;, you will have the right to enforce the emperor's will, and become the real ruler of Japan.&#10;&#10;Samurai allows you to take control of Japan. In medieval Japan, the central government of the emperor was dissolved. He become a powerless figurehead while various clans competed to take control of the country. &#10;These clans were similar to the noble houses of Europe; and their leaders the equivalent of medieval Dukes, Barons, Counts, and the like. &#10;Using formldable samurai warriors, the clans waged endless wars across the major islands of the Japanese archipelago.&#10;&#10;Concept of Play &#10;Each player controls a clan, with one or more lords. Each lord has a province representing his personal &quot;fief&quot; or home, and often has additional holdings of troops, titles, ships, castles, and more provinces.&#10;&#10;The game is played in 20 turns, each representing a pace of historical events running between a few months to a few years. In each turn, moves are conducted on a mapboard that portrays the three major islands of Japan.&#10;&#10;The playing pieces-360 in all-include Samurai Lords, clan control markers, holdings and title counters, troops, garrisons, and more; all explained in the easy&shy; to-follow prose of the 18-page rules folder.&#10;&#10;Many Games in One &#10;An excellent game for 2 to 8 players. Samurai is suitable for beginning and intermedlate play, with plenty of optional rules and strategic options for even the expert. And for the really hard-core power-politics fanatics, special rules create a nearly &quot;perpetual&quot; game representing tho true ebb and flow of Japanese feudal confilct. &#10;Samurai includes a variety of playing aids to make learning and playing the game truly an effortless task. The rules manual contains historical background and designer's notes that offer the player the full flavor and authenticity of what medieval conflict was all about in the age of the &quot;Shogun&quot; struggles.&#10;&#10;&#10;(BGG description:)&#10;&#10;Samurai is a game about warfare and politics in feudal Japan.

These are: the Emperor, The Heir, The Imperial Regalia and Kyoto Castle.&#10;&#10;Playing pieces are the samurai lords of various houses. Each lord has a home province which provides him with troops.

67;Conquest;"Conquest was designed to be a diceless wargame.  Its latest version updates the original with plastic units and a colorful map.  Set in ancient times, Conquest has players utilizing troops, cavalry, chariots, elephants and ships to try to capture their opponents' fortifications or occupy the &quot;quest&quot; locations.  The map is designed for point-to-point movement, and play hinges on a pool of action points that each side uses to move its different units.  Conquest comes in two versions, one designed for four players and one designed exclusively for two.&#10;&#10;";1974;6.41337;2.4706

Sounds easy, right?&#10;&#10;Rule One: Black plays first. Still sounds easy? Not so fast!&#10;&#10;Rule Two: The seemingly sudden 'Sandwich Move'. Just like it sounds, when you entrap two of your opponent's pieces between two of your own, you get to &quot;evict&quot; one of your opponent's pieces. This 'Sandwich Move' really does &quot;bollox up&quot; the game plan of the unwary player. Often the Sandwich Move can completely turn the game around and give you a dazzling win.&#10;&#10;1999 Mensa Select&#10;&#10;";1999;6.746;2.4
71;Civilization;"Civilization is a game of skill for 2 to 7 players. It covers the development of ancient civilizations from the invention of agriculture c. 8000 B.C. to the emergence of Rome around the middle of the third century B.C. Each player leads a nation of peoples over a map board of the Eastern Mediterranean and Near East as they attempt to carve a niche for themselves and their culture.&#10;&#10;Although battles and territorial strategy are important, this is not a war game because it is not won by battle or conquest. Instead, the object of play is to gain a level of overall advancement involving cultural, economic, and political factors so that such conflicts that do arise are a result of rivalry and land shortage rather than a desire to eliminate other players. Nomad and farmer, warrior and merchant, artisan and citizen all have an essential part to play in the development of civilization. It is the player who most effectively changes emphasis between these various outlooks who will achieve the best balance and win.&#10;&#10;(from the Introduction to the Avalon Hill edition rulebook)&#10;&#10;This game has a huge following and is widely regarded as one of the best games about ancient civilizations. Each player takes on the role of leader of an ancient civilization, such as the Illyrians or Babylonians. Your task is to guide your people through the ages by expanding your empire and using its proceeds to finance new technological advances, such as Literacy, Metalworking, or Law. The advancements help your civilization better cope with its problems as well as help bring new advancements.&#10;&#10;Civilization is widely thought to be the first game ever to incorporate a &quot;technology tree,&quot; allowing players to gain certain items and abilities only after particular other items were obtained. This influential mechanism has been adopted by countless other board games, card games, and computer games.&#10;&#10;";1980;7.49244;3.6435
73;Show Manager;"The players put together four shows in any order.  To accomplish this, players draft actor cards from a constantly changing queue of cards.  Each card represents actors of varying skills at roles.  Once a player puts together all the needed roles for a show, the value is judged against all the other productions of that type, with points given relative to the other productions.&#10;&#10;This is a Queen Games reprint of the db-Spiele original, Premiere.&#10;&#10;";1996;6.9808;2.0938
75;Falling;"This game is from an odd genre, real-time card games.  Each of the players (except the dealer) is a person falling to his death.  The goal is not to live, rather just to be the last one to go splat.  The dealer continues dealing cards to players, eventually giving them 'ground' cards.  But on the way down players can do all kinds of nasty stuff to each other to ensure their relative longevity.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.50586;1.218
77;EastFront: The War in Russia, 1941-45;"EastFront details the conflict between Germany and the Soviet Union during WWII.  Players have to contend with production, supply, command control and whether to try and break the other side's lines.  Several scenarios cover every major point of the war.  The game comes with a fantastic, detailed map of Eastern Europe and Russia printed on cardstock and many wooden blocks for the units.  This is a stand alone game that can also serve as one element of the complete EuroFront series which covers the entire European conflict of WWII.&#10;&#10;This title uses the Columbia Games Block system.  While there are variations in the rule sets, all of the &quot;Front&quot; series of games are based on the block system.  Basically this means that rather than using traditional counters to represent units on the map the game uses wooden blocks that stand upright with unit details only shown on one side.  This accomplishes two things:  First it provides an easy way of producing a &quot;fog of war&quot; because your opponent cannot tell, save through good memory or deduction, what type of unit a specific piece is or its current strength.  Second, having the blocks stand on end allows the possibility of rotating a block so the current strength is the top number.  Although most war games have some type of mechanism that allows units to take losses in steps of their overall strength, counters normally have at most two steps because they only have two sides.  Blocks, however, have four so you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide.&#10;&#10;With the use of blocks, Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding complex layers of bookkeeping, allowing interesting and relatively short sessions of play.&#10;&#10;";1991;7.67256;3.6

In over four years of titanic struggle, the ancient Europe of Kings and Emperors tore itself to pieces, giving birth to our own violent modern age. The bloody battles fought in the trenches of the Western Front, the icy plains of Poland, the mountains of the Balkans, and the deserts of Arabia, shaped the world we know today.

As the Central Powers you must use the advantage of interior lines and the fighting skill of the Imperial German Army to win your rightful 'place in the sun.' As the Entente Powers (Allies) you must bring your greater numbers to bear to put an end to German militarism and ensure this is the war 'to end all wars.'

Not only is the game innovative, but it also plays fast, usually within just an evening.&#10;&#10;While the game itself has all of the normal expectations of a wargame, with various units, CRT charts and period chrome, at heart the game rests within the card play.  Players are given a hand of cards to play out six sub-phases of a turn.  Each sub-phase allows for the use of a card or a pass with a minimal movement of units.  Each card has four possible uses: operational movement, strategic movement, special events, and replacement points.  The cardplay forces players to constantly make tough decsions as they feel that they need to do a little bit of everything but they can only do one thing at a time.  How you play your cards will decide to a large degree the outcome of the war.&#10;&#10;";1999;8.07738;3.854
93;El Grande;"In this award-winning game, players take on the roles of Grandes in medieval Spain.  The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions.  To that end, you draft caballeros (knights) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions.  After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).&#10;&#10;A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards vary from round to round.&#10;&#10;The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had there into the region you secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande and in the region containing the king.&#10;&#10;";1995;7.76386;2.9438

During a turn, you roll a die, optionally move any of your hedgehogs one row left or right, then move any hedgehog (not necessarily yours!) in the row your rolled forward one space.  But watch out for black spaces; hedgehogs caught there can't continue moving until they're in last place.  The first player to get three of their four hedgehogs to the end of the board wins.

97;Conquest of the Empire;"Conquest of the Empire is part of Milton Bradley&#039;s Gamemaster series.  It is set during the Roman Empire and depicts the struggle around the Mediterranean as rival factions attempt to take control of the empire.  Each player plays one of these factions and receives a Caesar figure, several general figures, and ships of a specific color.  Along with these leaders, players utilize a pool of generic units composed of infantry, cavalry, and catapults.  All game pieces are plastic figures.&#10;&#10;Players attempt to conquer their neighbors and build up cities and fortifications to increase production of wealth.  Players also may build road networks that allow for faster movement, by all armies.  Along the way players have to contend with rising inflation which makes military units more and more expensive.

From the west arrives hordes of Asian foes; from the south arrives a union of South American countries through Mexico, and from the east lands come legions of Soviets who have taken over all of Europe. America besieged has to rely on the remaining ground and air forces left in the country along with partisan uprisings to defend mom's apple pie.&#10;&#10;Up to four players can play Fortress America, one player being the U.S. and up to three others controlling the invading units from a particular direction. Being a near future scenario, the units in the game include conventional infantry, APCs, hovertanks, helicopters, bombers, US partisan units, and special &quot;Star Wars&quot; laser relay systems that fire from space.&#10;&#10;The game emphasizes combined arms in that players receive a bonus if infantry, mechanized, and air power are all used in a conflict. For the invading countries, all the units they receive for the game are given at the start so they must manage them wisely. The U.S., however, starts with a skeleton defense and builds up throughout the game through a random deck of cards. Further, the U.S. slowly builds up its Star Wars system, so the longer the invaders are delayed, the more powerful the U.S. becomes both conventionally and through its defense system.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Fortress America (2012)&#10;&#10;&#10;";1986;6.72174;2.6305
101;Detroit-Cleveland Grand Prix;"This game is part of a family which includes Top Race, Daytona 500, and Formel 1.  Players are dealt a hand of cards which have movement numbers for one or more of the cars.  When a card is played, the cars are advanced the number of spaces indicated in order from top to bottom.  However, if the track is blocked, then that movement is lost, so the idea is to use the cards that help your opponents (which you'll likely have to play eventually) only when they won't be able to take advantage of the movement.&#10;&#10;";1996;6.77672;1.713
103;Titan;"This classic game of the Fantasy Monster Slug-a-thon is a standby from the The Avalon Hill Game Co of yore.  The game still has a very devoted following, which is a tribute to the depth of the various strategies and approaches.  The game is divided into two realms, the masterboard and the battleboards.  On the masterboard, legions of mythical creatures roam about trying to recruit bigger and badder monsters and kill opposing legions in the process.  When a combat occurs, the action moves to the corresponding battleboard type corresponding to the area the fight is taking place in.  After lots of dice are tossed, the army that remains standing is returned to the masterboard with the spoils of war: points.&#10;&#10;The points are used to recruit Angels and Archangels and to augment the leader character of the player's army: The Titan.  As the points increase, the Titans become ever more powerful; at game end, the titan is able to kill most other character with a single blow. But be careful: If the Titan dies, the player is out of the game.&#10;&#10;The last Titan standing is the ruler of all, and winner of the game.&#10;&#10;";1980;6.96373;3.4642
105;Colossal Arena;"Colossal Arena/Titan:The Arena is a strategic card game for 2 to 5 players: you play, not as combatants, but as spectators, cheering and betting on the melee ongoing in a fantasy arena/colosseum in which fantasy creatures are pitted against each other in battle!&#10;&#10;Each round one of the creatures will die. To decide which unlucky soul will be the victim, players put numbered power cards in front of the creatures, with the lowest one going to the graveyard.  The jockeying for position and strategic diplomacy in playing the numbered power cards can be intense - but what makes this game even more interesting is that the players' place bets throughout the game which will sometimes allow them to use a creature's special power in battle!&#10;&#10;The winner at the end of the game is the bettor who's raked in the most winnings - just another day in the life of a fantasy monster gambler.&#10;&#10;Titan: The Arena is actually a reworking of a Reiner Knizia game called Grand National Derby, but The Avalon Hill Game Co's remake was quite significant from a gameplay standpoint.&#10;&#10;The Titan: The Arena printing is often confused with its namesake, Titan.  But other than the fact that they both use fantasy creatures as a general theme, there is very little that is similar between the two.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by: Galaxy: The Dark Ages&#10;&#10;";1997;6.75866;2.0203
107;Peaceful Resistance;"This small-publisher game comes with loads of wooden hex-shaped tiles, a hex board, and three pawns.  The object of the game is to move your pawn from one corner of the hex board to the opposite corner.  However, instead of taking your move, you can place a hex tile on the board.  These are used to block your opponent, because while your pawn can always go down any number of hex tiles, it can only step up one level at a time.&#10;&#10;";1995;5.72353;1.0
109;Wettstreit der Baumeister;"Jean du Po&#195;&#171;l put this game out on the market for about a year before the game's name was changed to Wettstreit der Baumeister in 1998.&#10;&#10;This translates to &quot;Contest of the Architects&quot;. The game has a beautiful assortment of large, thick tiles to represent the cities. Players bid on a single building tile every turn, with half the proceeds going to the auctioning player. When a player is ready to start construction of his city, the tiles are laid out in order with the single restriction that not two touching tiles are the same type. The building types are city halls, churches, towers, and gates. When the one of the two draw piles is exhausted, the cities are judged for symmetry, with the highest scoring city winning.&#10;&#10;Rules apply to either game:&#10;&#10;Within two decks of 20 cards are contained the City Wall, Towers and Gates, Churches, City Halls, etc. During play, one of the decks lies face up, the other face down. There are three parts to each player's turn. First, the player rolls a die in an attempt to better his finances (1 to 5 on the die; the sixth side gives a sabotage-counter instead). Second, he alone may look at the top hidden card before he makes an offer on either of the two top cards from the two decks. The other players then bid on the two cards. If the player (the Auctioneer) makes the highest bid, he may take the card and pay the bank. If, on the other hand, one of the other players buys the card, that player pays half the money to the bank and half to the Auctioneer. Third, a player may either build (lay down another card on his city) or sabotage a City Card of another player. The player receiving the sabotage must then pay the value of the card or remove it.&#10;&#10;The game ends when either of the decks is depleted.&#10;&#10;";1994;6.11169;1.9643
111;RheinlÃ¤nder;"This Reiner Knizia game, produced by Hasbro&#039;s European division, casts players in the roles of dukes who are trying to establish duchies along the banks of the Rhine River.  Players hold a hand of cards that correspond to numbered plots on each bank, and they place knights in open plots for which they hold the corresponding cards.  After establishing duchies, players attempt to expand them to include more plots of land, as well as buildings - such as castles, cathedrals, and cities. These buildings both add to the value of a duchy and provide their owners with advantages during game play.  Combined with a uniquely Knizia-style scoring system, this game has some very interesting dynamics.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.6552;2.3139
113;Plotters, Inc.;"Plotters, Inc., first released as Mit List und T&uuml;cke (&quot;With Cunning and Treachery&quot;), is a trick-taking game with quite a few twists. The deck consists of cards in four suits, and the deck is adjusted based on the player count so that everyone receives a hand of 14 cards to begin a round. At the start of a trick, the lead player plays any card, setting trump for that trick. Each other player plays any card that they like &mdash; except that once three colors of cards have been played, the fourth color cannot be played. Whoever plays the highest trump card wins the trick and collects two of the cards played (or three cards in a game with five or six players), placing these cards in front of them. Whoever plays the lowest non-trump card collects the remaining cards; this player leads to the next trick.&#10;&#10;Once a player has cards of all four colors in front of them, they must choose two colors and leave cards of this color face up, placing all other cards face down. As they collect more cards, they place them face up or face down based on their colors. The round ends after 14 tricks or when a player would be forced to play a card of the fourth color to a trick; in this latter case, the round ends immediately. Each player then scores the cards they've collected. For their two face-up colors, they multiply these numbers together; they then divide this product by the number of cards that they placed face down, rounding this number down. For example, if you have 6 yellow cards, 4 red cards, and 2 blue cards, then you have (6 &bull; 4)/2 = 12 points. If you collect cards of only one color, then you score 0 points!&#10;&#10;Play as many rounds as the number of players. Whoever has the highest total score wins!&#10;&#10;";1999;6.75621;1.8261
115;I'm the Boss!;"The six Investor cards are shuffled and one is dealt face up to each player. Any Investor cards not dealt to the players are set aside for now. The Influence Card deck is shuffled and each player is dealt five cards face down. The player whose Investor is first in alphabetical order goes first. The player to the starting player&rsquo;s right places the Dollar marker on any space on the game board.&#10;&#10;Each space on the game board represents a potential deal which Investors have to approve the deal and the number of dividends to be paid to those investors.&#10;&#10;On one&rsquo;s turn, a player can open negotiations on the deal where the Dollar marker rests or roll the six-sided die. If the player rolls the die, the Dollar marker is advanced clockwise around the game board counting the available deals as spaces. Once the Dollar marker rests, the player may try to negotiate that deal or draw three Influence cards. If by drawing cards, the player&rsquo;s hand exceeds twelve the player chooses which cards to discard to the limit.&#10;&#10;Should a player choose to make the deal, the player negotiates with the player or players representing the Investors how to divide the money at stake. The amount is number of dividends written on the space multiplied by value of the shares written on the deal tile. Any or all of the players may use their Influence cards to affect the outcome of the deal:&#10;&#10;&bull;    Clan cards may act in place of Investors whether the Investors are in play or not.&#10;&bull;    Travel cards put Investors out of play for the negotiations. Some are specific for a given Investor; some are wild to be played on any Investor.&#10;&bull;    Recruitment cards can only be played in sets of three to steal another player&rsquo;s Investor and make it your own.&#10;&bull;    Boss cards give the player control of the negotiations.&#10;&bull;    Stop cards immediately stop the effects of Travel, Recruitment, and Boss Influence cards.&#10;&#10;The players are paid from the bank when a deal has been struck. The game board space is covered with the Deal tile (effectively closing the space from further game play), the Dollar marker is moved to the next open space, and play continues with next player.&#10;&#10;Once nine deals have been made, a die is rolled after each subsequent deal to determine whether the game ends (with the odds increasing each time). Victory goes to whoever has the biggest bankroll!&#10;&#10;--user description&#10;&#10;";1994;6.7725;1.9655
117;Ta YÃ¼;"In Ta Y&uuml;, a game of connections, one side tries to extend from the starting tile in the center to reach the western and eastern edges of the board while the opposing side tries to reach the northern and southern edges.  On your turn you simply draw a tile and decide where to place it, extending the network of tiles already on the board.&#10;&#10;Several refinements make this simple proposition into an engrossing game.  First, each tile is 3x1 (to be played on a 19x19 board) and has exactly three outlets (potential connection points). Second, your score is not simply the number of spots you've reached on one edge added to the number of spots you've reached on the other, but is the product of those two numbers.  So you can't just concentrate on one side and ignore the other, because zero times anything is still zero.  Third, on each side of the board there are three special points which score double if reached, adding a dab of focus to the choices.&#10;&#10;Interestingly, you need to play both offense and defense and will often have to decide to which use to put a particular tile.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.94776;2.0662
119;Cosmolancer;"Auf Heller und Pfennig takes participants to a medieval marketplace. Each turn, players place tiles onto the grid board that modify (either positively or negatively) the amount of money to be made by the shops that share that tile's row or column. Three times the board is filled with tiles and shop money is earned, after which the player with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;In Kingdoms, the first English-language version of Auf Heller und Pfennig, players try to collect the most gold by establishing castles in the richest regions of the realm while avoiding hazards like dragons, swamps, and trolls. The 2011 edition includes detailed plastic castles, a streamlined rulebook, and the addition of a wizard tile &mdash; one that increases the rank of adjacent castles, multiplying their scores &mdash; previously available only at game conventions.&#10;&#10;As of 2024, Cosmolancer is the newest version of this design, with players taking the role of freelance photographers...in space! As in the other versions, the game lasts three rounds, and to start a round, each player draws a random tile and keeps it secret. On a turn, you either:&#10;&#10;&bull; Draw a tile and place it in an empty space on the 6x5 grid.&#10;&bull; Place the tile in your hand.&#10;&bull; Place one of your tokens, which are numbered 1-4, in an empty space.&#10;&#10;When all of the spaces are filled, you score each of your tokens, multiplying the number on the token by the sum of the tiles in its row and column, with some special tiles nullifying positive values or splitting a row into two segments. You retrieve all of your 1 tokens, but the others are now out of play. After three rounds, whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;";1994;6.67197;1.8361
121;Dune;"Set thousands of years in the future, Dune the board game is based on the Frank Herbert novels about an arid planet at the heart of the human space empire's political machinations.&#10;&#10;Designed by the creators at Eon of Cosmic Encounter fame, some contend that the game can best be described as Cosmic Encounter set within the Dune universe, but the two games bear little in common in the actual mechanisms or goals; they're just both set in space. Like Cosmic Encounter, it is a game that generates player interaction through negotiation and bluffing.&#10;&#10;Players each take the role of one of the factions attempting to control Dune. Each faction has special powers that overlook certain rules in the game. Each turn players move about the map attempting to pick up valuable spice while dealing with giant sandworms, deadly storms, and other players' military forces. A delicate political balance is formed amongst the factions to prevent any one side from becoming too strong. When a challenge is made in a territory, combat takes the form of hidden bids with additional treachery cards to further the uncertainty.&#10;&#10;The game concludes when one faction (or two allied factions) is able to control a certain number of strongholds on the planet.&#10;&#10;Note that the Descartes edition of Dune includes the Duel Expansion and Spice Harvest Expansion, the Landsraad variant from Avalon Hill's General magazine, and additional character disks not provided by AH.&#10;&#10;";1979;7.58602;3.4498
123;Green Thumb Cards;"In this card game players are competing gardeners, attempting to collect sets of various plants in order to put them into their stacks.  In the meantime their incomplete sets are vulnerable to various event cards and other players.  Players have a number of attack cards at their disposal which they can use to wreak havoc on opponents' gardens.  These cards range from bugs and pests to kids tromping through the garden, and even animals that chew up or pee all over the plants.&#10;&#10;";1996;7.31034;1.2
125;Money!;"Your goal in Money! is to trade currencies with the bank and other players so that you end up with more value than anyone else.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a hand of six cards from a deck that contains cards in seven currencies ranging in value from 20-60, along with coins worth 10. Four cards from the deck are placed face up to its left and to its right.&#10;&#10;In a round, each player chooses a bid of one or more cards from their hand, then everyone reveals their bid simultaneously. Whoever bid the highest sum takes the four cards to the left or right of the deck or another player's bid, adds these cards to their hand, then places their bid next to the deck or in front of the player whose bid they took. (Alternatively, the player can return their bid to hand.) Then the next player with the highest bid resolves their bid similarly. Once all players have resolved their bids, draw cards from the deck to refill the lots to the left and right of the deck to four cards. When the deck runs out, play one final round, then score your cards in hand.&#10;&#10;If you have 200 or more in a single currency, score that many points. If you have less than 200 in a currency, subtract 100 from that amount but don't go below 0. If you have all three 20s or 30s in a currency, score 100 points in addition to whatever the currency itself scores for you. Sum these amounts, along with whatever coins you have in hand.

The name means 'Trading House' and the players act as merchants vying for supremacy in late 17th century Amsterdam. By building trading houses at the canals you aim to control three major commodities (Spices, Tea and Wine) in each harbor area. During the game you expand by playing Land and Water cards in the large area of the harbor. By the end of the game points are awarded according to ownership of the largest commodity majorities in each harbor area.&#10;&#10;This game has many optional rules, scenarios, expansions and variations.

In it, players try to come up with a word that contains a certain sequence of letters before the ticking time-bomb in their hands explodes.  The bomb is an electronic timer with a variable time allotment, and a player is only allowed to pass the bomb to the next person when he comes up with a word that contains the needed letters.

Each player is assigned one of six different characters -- each with its own unique abilities -- but can pretend to be any character and use its corresponding powers.  Abilities are used to acquire 3 different types of goods, which can be spent to get clues to opponents' identities.  If the majority of the other players think you're pretending to be a character that you're not, you must either admit that you are not that character (and permanently lose the use of its power), or reveal that you are and win the game.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented as:&#10;&#10;    Die Erben von Hoax&#10;&#10;&#10;";1981;5.90022;1.3529
141;Andromeda;"Each player controls bases/stations (in the form of little wooden cubes) which they use to attempt to build Economic Centers on the moons of seven planets in an alien planetary system.  After moving their tokens on to a planet, players use an interesting little device ('planet ring'/'wormhole' - functions like a blind draw bag) to select one of the tokens on the planet.  Players take actions by collecting sets of cards which correspond to the the various planets.  The game also features a unique trading system which facilitates the card collecting. Careful card trading and calculating risk of establishing economic centers, and some variants, mitigate some of the luck factor.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;Setup: 9 cards/player. Place 1 cube per planet per player, plus additional cube per planet matching cards dealt out; remaining cubes on earth. Each gets 2 special action cards.Each round: First, players may play a single special action card, in order. Then, Trade Step. Finally, Action Step.&#10;&#10;Trade Step: Start player first plays cards (2-3) to offer, one at a time; other players simultaneously show cards to trade, different than offered. Start player must trade; recipient either accepts cards into hand, or leaves out. Clockwise from Start Player, next player with cards still in front of them either makes a trade or takes their cards back. Continue till 0-1 people left with cards in front; they take them back to hand.&#10;&#10;Action Step: Start player takes 3 actions, then others take 2 each. Actions can be:&#10;- discard 2 cards, then draw 2&#10;- turn in set of 3-7 cards to send half (rounding down) as many cubes from earth to a planet&#10;- turn in set of 3-7 cards to advance Ship Level, Tech Level, or to make attempt to establish colony on a planet matching cards played: place cubes on that planet into the cosmic ashtray, randomize, then reveal up to as many cubes as attempts made. If reveal your cube, place it on a station; turn over. If other player's cube, send it back to earth.&#10;- Sets: if no wilds (&quot;pure&quot;), take appropriate bonus wild card matching the size of the set (if available); wilds can be used later as parts of sets&#10;&#10;Then rotate starting player to the left.

The map is a collection of city blocks broken into smaller properties.  Each turn, players choose one property and try to work out deal for placing a new structure on the board.  The value of each building is determined by the type of buildings in the same block, so both a school and an apartment building receive bonuses for existing together.&#10;&#10;";1984;6.36169;2.2353

Just as with real world energy companies, player will setup facilities for oil drilling, oil pumping, oil refining into gasoline, and gasoline selling to the consumer... all of which are represented by actual plastic pieces placed on the board!  Players also speculate by buying and selling oil and gasoline barrels in both the domestic and foreign markets... again represented by actual plastic barrels in their playing area!&#10;&#10;However, the changing economic climate, as well as sudden world news events, will challenge players to keep a long-term strategic view of the world energy markets.

151;Piratenbillard;"This interesting dexterity game is played on a table-like board that is a wooden lattice with a piece of linen stretched over the bottom.  Little colored balls are placed in the resulting holes, and then players use long wooden mallets to strike the bottom of the table.  When a ball is hit correctly, it will pop out of the space it's in and land in another space closer to the opposite side of the board.  Landing on another player's ball lets you capture it, but if your ball lands off the board, it's out of the game.&#10;&#10;";1989;6.55146;1.2414
153;Take 5!;"Relying heavily on his previous effort, 6 Nimmt!, Wolfgang Kramer has transformed it into a more strategic game.  The deck is numbered from 1 to 98, with some of the cards having green bullheads and others having red bullheads.  In this game greens are positive points and reds are negative points.  As in 6 Nimmt!, players are constructing sets of cards, with the fifth card in a set taking the whole thing.  This time, however, players take their turns sequentially and can play one to three cards from their hands.&#10;&#10;In a confusing twist, the Dutch edition of 6 Nimmt! is called Take 5! but is the progenitor game, not this game.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.55984;1.474
155;Was sticht?;"This is a two-trump, trick-taking card game, with several twists.  At the beginning of the game, players draft tasks they intend to complete in order to win the game.  (Tasks include things like &quot;Take no tricks&quot;, &quot;Take 1 Trick&quot;, or &quot;Take No Red Cards&quot;.)  Then, all of the cards are dealt out in front of the players before each hand.  Row by row, the players draft cards, and the dealer declares who would have won each row's trick, if it had been played that way.  Players use this information to deduce what the trump number and suit are.  After all the cards are drafted, each player - except the dealer - selects one of the task tiles she drafted, which will be her mission for the hand.  The dealer is stuck trying to uniquely accomplish someone else's task for the round - but at least doesn't have to preselect which person's goal he is trying to &quot;steal&quot;.  The hand is then played in the traditional fashion, with each player trying to take tricks or not, based on the goal she selected.  The first player to complete five tasks wins the game.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    M&#195;&#188; and Lots More&#10;&#10;&#10;";1993;6.98274;2.377
157;Eurorails;"Eurorails is another entry in the Mayfair Games crayon rail games, like Empire Builder and India Rails.  Its puzzle-piece board forms a map of Europe broken down into dots.  Players use different-colored crayons to draw rail from dot to dot, building their rail system.  A large deck of cards is used to determine how much money will be generated by picking up a particular commodity and delivering it to the listed city, with the payoffs being related to how far away the source is from the destination.  As players generate more money, they build successively larger and more comprehensive rail systems, hopefully connecting to almost all the major cities.  The goal of the game is to generate a set amount of money once you've linked all the major cities.&#10;&#10;";1990;7.09791;2.7432

After one of those words has been read aloud, players try to come up with definitions that at least sound plausible, because points are later awarded for every opposing player who guessed that your definition was the correct one.&#10;&#10;Versions of the game as a parlor game go back at least as far as 1970, although Balderdash itself was not published until 1984.&#10;&#10;Mattel, Inc. republished Balderdash in 2006 in a form that derives its gameplay from the sequel Beyond Balderdash.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Beyond Balderdash / Absolute Balderdash&#10;    Kokkelimonke Jubileum&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Beyond Balderdash*&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    In a peculiar situation, this game was reimplemented by Beyond/Absolute Balderdash and then combined back into the original title (Balderdash) but with the rules and cards from Beyond/Absolute; while Tactic re-published their version of Beyond/Absolute combined with the original Balderdash and called it Kokkelimonke Jubileum.&#10;&#10;&#10;";1984;6.4785;1.3977
164;Before I Kill You, Mister Spy...;"Before I Kill You, Mr. Bond is a silly, stupid game straight from the Cheapass Games playbook. In it, players take on the role of villains building their remote fortresses and capturing secret agents. When one is captured, he can be killed right away, but what's the fun in that? The real points come when you slowly reveal your secret plan to him &mdash; or leave him to be eaten by sharks. Of course, that's where the risk is, too, and the longer you postpone the kill, the greater the likelihood that another player will produce a card that allows the agent to escape and destroy your fortress.&#10;&#10;Reissued in color in 2004 as James Ernest's Totally Renamed Spy Game (with many more cards), then reissued again in 2016 as Before I Kill You, Mister Spy...&#10;&#10;";1996;5.43594;1.265
166;Black Death;"In this cheerfully demented offering, participants each play the part of a disease trying to inflict misery on the European populace.  Each disease has mortality (lethalness) and virulence (contagiousness) factors, and the key to causing maximum suffering is striking the right balance between the two.  It's no good being a fast-acting disease if your carriers all die before passing you on to the next city!&#10;&#10;";1993;5.74468;1.85
168;Empire Builder;"Epic Railroad Building in North America&#10;&#10;Discover a modern North American classic.  Celebrate one of our most vital and enduring passions: railroads.  Use your initial investment to build track.  Then pick up commodities where they are grown, mined, or manufactured and deliver them to a lucrative place of demand.  Complete a delivery and make the money you need to buy larger, faster trains, and expand your railroad empire.  Win the game by building the most effective railroad empire!&#10;&#10;The original and flagship of Mayfair&#039;s crayon-rails line allows players, using washable crayons, to draw their train routes over a map of North America.  Players start with an initial sum of money which they use to build short lengths of track during their first couple of turns.  For the rest of the game, players operate their trains over the track network drawn on the board to pick up and deliver loads to various cities, and then have the opportunity to add to their track network or improve their train.  The game uses demand cards which list three demands, each of a commodity to be delivered to a specified city for a given payoff.  Each player has three demand cards to provide opportunities for income.&#10;&#10;Each turn consists of an operations phase and a building phase.  During the operations phase, trains are moved to cities where commodities are picked up at no cost and moved to one of the cities on that player's demand cards.  When the commodity is delivered, the player receives the payoff and trades that demand card for a new one.  Event cards are mixed in the deck with the demand cards.  When an event card is drawn the instructions are followed.  During the building phase a player may pay to build more track or upgrade his train.&#10;&#10;A player wins by being the first to connect his track network to six of the seven major cities on the board and acquire $250,000,000 in cash on hand.&#10;&#10;";1982;6.96442;2.6318
170;Family Business;"Family Business takes mob warfare to a new level of backstabbing, revenge, and general bloodthirstiness, which is what makes it such a blast to play.  Every player controls a 'family' and plays various cards to off other players' family members.  In a game with this little structure, it's possible for everyone to gang up on one unlucky soul, or for the damage to be fairly evenly spread.  Either way, the last family standing is victorious.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a gang of nine characters. To try to get rid of other gangsters, contracts are played on them. If these contracts are not blocked by anyone, the targeted gangster is placed on the hitlist. As soon as six gangsters are on the hitlist a mobwar is started. This means that, at the start of every turn, the first character on this list is eliminated. This goes on until the list is empty.&#10;&#10;Mobwars can also be triggered by cards being played. When no more than the last six or fewer characters are in play a constant mobwar is going on, until only one player has characters left.&#10;&#10;In general players take turns clockwise, however, the turn goes to any player who plays a response card and then clockwise mode is resumed with the player next to him/her. Lots of interaction as players play cards to put gangsters on the list, save them, have them replaced, start a Mob War, or stop it...&#10;&#10;";1982;6.07366;1.3187
172;For Sale;"For Sale is a quick, fun game nominally about buying and selling real estate. During the game's two distinct phases, players first bid for several buildings then, after all buildings have been bought, sell the buildings for the greatest profit possible.&#10;&#10;The original Ravensburger/FX Schmid edition (1997/98) has slightly different rules than later English editions, and only 20 buildings instead of 30.&#10; The &#195;&#156;berplay 2005 Edition has new art, rules and card distribution changes, and it accommodates 3-6 players.&#10;&#10;The Gryphon 2009 Edition uses the &Uuml;berplay art for the faces of the property cards, while replacing most other art.  The rules are the same as the &Uuml;berplay edition, with the exception of the rounding rule (which was stated in different ways in different printings of the &Uuml;berplay edition).&#10;&#10;Rounding rule&#10;&#10;The rounding rule preferred by the designer Stefan Dorra is that players get back half of their bid rounded DOWN (not UP), as confirmed in correspondence with him here and here.  A history of how the rounding rule has changed in different editions is documented here.&#10;&#10;";1997;7.26098;1.2527
174;T-Rex;"Many regard this game as a trick-taking game, however that would be a very liberal interpretation of trick-taking.  Players are each given an equal set of cards, which they randomly pick a hand of seven.  Each hand one suit is a trump suit, and one suit is a non-trump suit.  Players place one of their cards in front of themselves, and this continues until the hand ends.  At that time, the top card on their piles are compared and the best card picks his reward first, and the remaining reward going to the second place.  The reward cards give players points, and the highest total at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.50693;1.9091
176;Give Me the Brain!;"Working in fast-food is hell.  All the employees are zombies, and you can't find a single brain amongst them.  Except for the brain part - there is, in fact, one brain - that's the premise of Give Me the Brain!, a card game in which players take on the roles of zombies in a fast-food restaurant in hell.  They all have to complete a number of tasks before leaving work, and the work keeps piling on.  Even worse, some of the tasks require basic intelligence and there's only one brain to go around.&#10;&#10;Note: Give Me the Brain: Superdeluxe Edition has 100 cards, instead of 112 with a few cards adjusted from previous versions.&#10;&#10;";1996;5.83556;1.2727
178;Mole Hill;"In this strange little game, players take the roles of a gardener protecting his lawn and a mole digging it up.  The gardener must try to block the mole's moves and fence him in quickly, while the mole must dig as many holes as possible before being caught.&#10;&#10;Essentially, the mole may move any direction, horizontally or diagonally from square to square, while the gardener places boundary sticks down along the edges of the square, which the mole may not cross.  The mole and gardener may either move or place down a boundary stick, and move alternately.  Eventually, the gardener will hem the mole in completely and the round is over.  In addition, if the mole can move into flower beds, extra points are scored.  By moving to the center, the mole may also tunnel deeply to any selected square on the board, thus escaping the (by then) rapidly closing trap of boundary sticks.  Depending on how many moves this took, more or less points are earned by the mole.&#10;&#10;Once points are totaled up, the roles are reversed and another round is played.  The winner is the player who scored the most points as the mole.&#10;&#10;";1997;5.99224;1.7188
180;Pool Position;"The setting is pool side at a swanky hotel and players are trying to get their beach towels into the choice locations next to the pool.  Players use equal sets of power cards to determine the number of placement points for each round.  These movement points are then used to place their towels or dislodge others' towels.  However activity in a particular row of towels attracts the attention of the cabana boys, who can eventually lock a row up permanently.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.77071;1.7273
182;Hungry;"In this quick, fun, and fairly abstract game, players play cards in an effort to acquire tiles that are either color-coded or number-coded.  Players take turns, first playing a card onto a tile that matches either the card's number or its color, then drawing to refill their hands.  When all cards have been played, each tile is evaluated, and whichever player has the most cards played to that tile gets that tile's points.  After calculating point totals and figuring in bonuses, the player with the highest score is the winner.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.36164;1.4239
186;Split;"Newer version of SPLIT is now available. Publisher is GDC-GameDevCo Ltd. The game still features the patented SPLIT half cards and looks much better than the original (design wise) and seems to have some adjustments to the rules.&#10;&#10;In this surprisingly solid offering from Hasbro, players use cards to take actions on a board.  The cards depict halves of a standard deck of cards, and players attempt to match the halves with those next to the board.  Depending on the quality of the match (perfect, strong, weak), the action is likewise powerful or weak.  The object of the game is to place a series of your markers in a continuous line across the board.  Also the game is scalable for two to six players, with four through six using partners to keep the action interesting.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented as:&#10;&#10;    Split (Revised Edition)&#10;&#10;&#10;";1999;5.93023;1.1333
188;Go;"By all appearances,  Go is just two players taking turns laying stones on a 19&times;19 (or smaller) grid of intersections.  But once its basic rules are understood,Go shows its staggering depth. One can see why many people say it's one of the most elegant brain-burning abstract games in history.&#10;&#10;Players place one stone at a time on the board at an empty intersection. The goal of the game is to try to claim the most territory by walling off sections of the board and surrounding or capturing each other's stones.  The game doesn't end until the board fills up, or, more often, when both players agree to end it, at which time whoever controls the most territory wins.&#10;&#10;";-2200;7.65517;3.9246
190;Dolce Vita;"Players are socialites who are trying to take as many high-value luxuries as they can manage.  A number of luxuries (boats, mansions, watches, boats, etc.) of values varying from one million to seven million are laid out in a matrix.  Players take turn placing power cards in the columns, and after five of the six cards have been played, the highest bid takes the first luxury in the column, the second highest gets the next one up, and so on.  However, if you collect a second luxury item you already own, then the newest one replaces the older one, which could mean exchanging a lavish seven million dollar car for a paltry one million dollar one!  After the specified number of rounds, the highest valued collection is deemed the best.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.14089;1.6875
192;Nicht die Bohne!;"This warped but fun card game is more intense than it first appears to be.  Players try to collect points in four different suits, but along the way points can be made negative instead of positive or even canceled entirely by taking one of the 'Nicht die Bohne' cards.  With its interesting trading mechanism, this game can be a little hard to grasp at first, but it's worth the effort.  A note to the wise: although this game shares a common theme of beans (Bohnen) with Bohnanza, that's about the only similarity.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.32002;1.3486
194;Groo: The Game;"In Groo: the Game, players compete to be the first to build a large town by playing 'building' cards that give them victory points.  Of course, this is no picnic, hindered as it is by other players' rampaging armies and the frequent bumbling visitations of Groo the Wanderer, determined by the roll of a set of dice, which can also grant players resources with which to build and 'Groo heads' with which to damage the unfortunates who have Groo in their village. Players can also develop armies to attack other players' cities  Excellent fun for the beer-and-pretzels crowd.&#10;&#10;";1997;6.28597;1.4865
196;Kremlin;"A game of political intrigue set in the Soviet Politburo of the early 20th century, with a satirical edge.  With politicians like Eduard Boremtodev, Nikolai Shootemdedsky and Natasha Nogoodnik vying for control of the party, you know the battle will be an entertaining one.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, a number of politician cards are laid out to fill the positions of the politburo.  Players then secretly note influence on ten politicians they hope to control during the game, indicated by a number from 1 to 10.&#10;Gameplay is not clockwise, but proceeds phase by phase with the politician holding the relevant office performing the appropriate action by the player who reveals the greatest influence on the politician in question.  Players attempt to remove politicians opposed to their interests by purging, exiling them to Siberia or by demoting them within the Politburo.  One&rsquo;s own preferred politicians can be promoted or pardoned of their previous &lsquo;sins&rsquo;. &#10;But each action a politician takes causes him (or in one case, her) to age by one or more years (a measure of the aging effect of the stress of the job). Each turn, politburo members face a health check which can result in the politician becoming ill, or even dying.  The 'older' a politician gets the more likely it is that he (or she) will become ill.&#10;At the end of each turn, the Party Chief must be healthy enough to wave to the crowd at the October parade. Controlling a politician who succeeds at this three times makes you the winner.&#10;&#10;The original Fata Morgana edition included rules requiring the players to hold funeral speeches for deceased party chairmen and drinking vodka with it, for instance. The later Avalon Hill edition scrapped these rules and gave the game a less satirical and more serious tone.&#10;&#10;Jolly Roger reimplemented an edition providing three different KREMLIN games in one box -See Kremlin (Third Edition)-:&#10;&#10;1: The 'original' with fictional politicians, set in a USSR where KGB investigations send those found guilty to Siberia. This version will have victory conditions based on the original Fata Morgana rules.&#10;&#10;2: A version inspired by the Avalon Hill variant titled 'Revolution'. Set in the 1920s, it uses historical politicians as well as fictional politicians. It's a more violent game as those arrested by the KGB are shot and removed from the game&#10;&#10;3: A new version, set in the modern USSR and Russia, an era of entrenched bureaucracy and alternatives for escaping KGB persecution. This version introduces the concept of &quot;Going into Exile&quot; to avoid Siberia. It also includes modern politicians from the 1960s onwards, whether it is Kosygin or Putin and Gorbachev.&#10;&#10;";1986;6.96879;2.8493
198;Buried Treasure;"In Buried Treasure, players compete to compile sets of colored cards by drawing from several common stacks.  Depending on what symbol is on a card, drawing it might let you take another from the stacks or even steal cards of the same color from one of your opponents.  At the end of the round, the majority holders of each color will gain points; the amount of points varies each round.&#10;&#10;Was awarded the title &quot;Best Family Card Game&quot; by Games Magazine in 2000.&#10;&#10;";1992;6.01264;1.5714
200;Entdecker;"[Careful: there are two similar games with Entdecker in the title. Don't confuse Entdecker with Die Neuen Entdecker (also known as Entdecker: Exploring New Horizons), a different game. In short - if your Entdecker's board has a scout trail leading to native huts, it's not this Entdecker.]&#10;&#10;Entdecker starts with a blank game board that represents an unexplored sea. Tiles are drawn and placed on squares on the board. As the tiles are placed islands develop on the board and players pay to place settlements, bases, or scouts on these islands in an effort to become the most powerful discoverer of all. Completed islands yield victory points to all who have invested in exploration on an island, but of course the most points go to the player who has established the strongest presence.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Die Neuen Entdecker or Entdecker: Exploring New Horizons&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     In 2004, a smaller version of the Entdecker game was released, based on the online version available on the www.playcatan.de site.&#10;         Oceania.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     In 2007, the game system was revamped in a new &quot;Entdecker&quot;-series of 3 titles (so far):&#10;         Im Reich der Jadegottin (published 2007)&#10;         Im Reich der W&#195;&#188;stensohne (published 2008)&#10;         Im Reich der D&auml;monen (not yet published)&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;";1996;6.41918;2.2468
