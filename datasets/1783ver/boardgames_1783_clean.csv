1;Die Macher;"Die Macher is a game about seven sequential political races in different regions of Germany. Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The 1986 edition featured four parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players. The 1997 edition supports up to five players in the re-united Germany and updated several features of the rules as well.  The 2006 edition also supports up to five players and adds a shorter five-round variant and additional rules updates by the original designer.&#10;&#10;";1986;7.58777;4.3081;3;5;240;14;Economic, Negotiation, Political;die macher seven sequential political race different region germany charge national political party manage limited resource help party party regional election different way regional election supply eighty depend size region party second party regional election medium influence region party receive medium party national party membership grow progress supply fair number lastly party party platform match national opinion end party old west germany support support united germany update support add short additional update original designer
2;Dragonmaster;"Dragonmaster is a trick-taking card game based on an older game called Coup d'&#195;&#137;tat. Each player is given a supply of plastic gems, which represent points. Each player will get to be the dealer for five different hands, with slightly different goals for each hand. After all cards have been dealt out, the dealer decides which hand best suits his or her current cards, and the other players are penalized points (in the form of crystals) for taking certain tricks or cards. For instance, if &quot;first&quot; or &quot;last&quot; is called, then a player is penalized for taking the first or last tricks. All players will get a chance to be dealer for five hands, but other players can steal this opportunity by taking all of the tricks during certain hands. At the end, the biggest pile of gems wins the game.&#10;&#10;Jewel contents:&#10;&#10;10 clear (2 extra)&#10;14 green (2 extra)&#10;22 red (2 extra)&#10;22 blue (2 extra)&#10;&#10;";1981;6.66468;1.9643;3;4;30;12;Card Game, Fantasy;dragonmaster trick taking card base old call coup d tat give supply plastic gem represent dealer different hand slightly different hand card deal dealer decide hand good suit current card penalize form crystal take certain trick card instance call penalize take trick chance dealer hand steal opportunity take trick certain hand end big pile gem jewel content clear extra green extra red extra blue extra
3;Samurai;"Samurai is set in medieval Japan. Players compete to gain the favor of three factions: samurai, peasants, and priests, which are represented by helmet, rice paddy, and Buddha figures scattered about the board, which features the islands of Japan. The competition is waged through the use of hexagonal tiles, each of which help curry favor of one of the three factions &mdash; or all three at once! Players can make lightning-quick strikes with horseback ronin and ships or approach their conquests more methodically. As each figure (helmets, rice paddies, and Buddhas) is surrounded, it is awarded to the player who has gained the most favor with the corresponding group.&#10;&#10;Gameplay continues until all the symbols of one type have been removed from the board or four figures have been removed from play due to a tie for influence.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players compare captured symbols of each type, competing for majorities in each of the three types. Ties are not uncommon and are broken based on the number of other, &quot;non-majority&quot; symbols each player has collected.&#10;&#10;The game is part of what is sometimes called the Knizia tile-laying trilogy.&#10;&#10;";1998;7.47596;2.442;2;4;60;10;Abstract Strategy, Medieval;samurai set medieval japan compete gain favor faction samurai peasant priest represent helmet rice paddy buddha figure scatter island japan competition wage use hexagonal tile help curry favor faction mdash lightning quick strike horseback ronin ship approach conquest methodically figure helmet rice paddy buddha surround award gain favor correspond group continue symbol remove figure remove tie influence end compare capture symbol compete majority tie uncommon break base number non majority symbol collect call knizia tile lay trilogy
4;Tal der KÃ¶nige;"When you see the triangular box and the luxurious, large blocks of Tal der K&ouml;nige (German: &quot;Valley of the Kings&quot;), you can tell this game was designed to be beautiful as well as functional.  The object of the game is to build pyramids out of the different colored blocks.  A pyramid scores more points when it's made from a few colors, but it's much harder to consistently outbid the other players for the necessary blocks.  The game is over when the Pharoah's Pyramid in the center is completed, which is built using all the blocks that the players don't use during the course of the game.&#10;&#10;Final round 1990 Hippodice Spieleautorenwettbewerb.&#10;&#10;";1992;6.6154;2.6875;2;4;60;12;Ancient;triangular box luxurious large block tal der k ouml nige german valley king tell beautiful functional object build pyramid different colored block pyramid color hard consistently outbid necessary block pharoah pyramid center complete build block don t use course final hippodice spieleautorenwettbewerb
5;Acquire;"In Acquire, each player strategically invests in businesses, trying to retain a majority of stock.  As the businesses grow with tile placements, they also start merging, giving the majority stockholders of the acquired business sizable bonuses, which can then be used to reinvest into other chains.  All of the investors in the acquired company can then cash in their stocks for current value or trade them 2-for-1 for shares of the newer, larger business.  The game is a race to acquire the greatest wealth.&#10;&#10;History of Acquire: This Sid Sackson classic has taken many different forms over the years depending on the publisher, yet the rules and game play have stayed the same. The 1966 version of the 3M bookshelf edition included rules for a 2-player variant. The original version is part of the 3M Bookshelf Series.&#10;&#10;Many books and websites incorrectly list this as a 1962 publication as the 3M Company used previously copyrighted artwork when they released the game in 1964. 3M actually received the idea for the game of &quot;Vacations&quot; from Sid Sackson in May of 1963 and decided to take his idea and put it into artwork they had developed the year before for a game called &quot;ACQUIRE.&quot; 3M's original game idea for a game called ACQUIRE must not have been very good so they decided to take Sid's idea of Vacations and put it into their concept of ACQUIRE. They released some limited test market games in 8 Midwestern U.S. cities in December of 1963 with a box that had a 1963 copyright. These games had Sid's original rules. When 3M released the mass market games in 1964, they had developed some of Sid's original ideas and changed some rules and game play to match their production desires. They released them with outer boxes that were copyrighted 1962 and inner boxes with rules that were dated 1963.&#10;&#10;December 1963 - Test Market World Map Wood Tile Edition&#10;1964 - Dated 1962/63 wood tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay &amp; stocks with printed backs&#10;1965 - Dated 1962/63 plastic tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay &amp; stocks with printed backs (last edition made with printed backs until 1999)&#10;1966 - Dated 1962/66 plastic tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay &amp; non-wax coated stocks (Only edition with these stocks)&#10;1968 - Dated 1968/66 plastic tiles, clear plastic board with paper underlay (Both 1966 inner box games have a lot of mixed parts)&#10;1971 - Dated 1968/71 plastic tiles, yellow hard plastic board&#10;1975 - 3M sells rights for game of ACQUIRE to the Avalon Hill Company&#10;1976 - Dated 1976 plastic tiles, yellow hard plastic board, redesigned money, no inner box (This edition was also produced in 1977, 79, 81, 82,       &amp; 86)&#10;1989 - Dated 1976 Gray box edition with new box artwork same contents as regular 1976 editions (This edition was also produced in 1992)&#10;1995 - Dated 1995 Large box cardboard edition with chipboard board and tiles, Special Powers Variant Tiles inspired by German editions&#10;1997 - Avalon Hill sells the rights to the game of ACQUIRE to Hasbro&#10;1999 - Dated 1999 Large box with large plastic board and tiles, 3D company buildings, redesigned stocks &amp; money, large info cards&#10;2006 - Hasbro assigns rights for the game of ACQUIRE to their subsidiary, Wizards of the Coast&#10;2006 - Lloyd's (private) Rules of ACQUIRE are made public, two major rule changes that help to bring the balance of the game of ACQUIRE back to the  intentions of Sid Sackson's original ideas.

6;Mare Mediterraneum;"In the ancient lands along the Mediterranean, players attempt to satisfy their unique victory conditions via trade, war and construction.  This lavishly produced game contains tons of wooden game components and a beautiful roll-out vinyl map.

7;Cathedral;"In Cathedral, each player has a set of pieces of a different color. The pieces are in the shapes of buildings, covering from one to five square units. The first player takes the single neutral Cathedral piece and places it onto the board. Players then alternate placing one of their buildings onto the board until neither player can place another building. Players capture territory by surrounding areas that are occupied by at most one opponent or neutral building. A captured piece is removed and captured territory becomes off-limits to the opponent. The player with the fewest 'square units' of buildings that can't be placed wins.&#10;&#10;";1979;6.54958;1.7887;2;2;20;8;Abstract Strategy, Children's Game, City Building, Territory Building;cathedral set piece different color piece shape building cover square unit take single neutral cathedral piece place alternate place building place building capture territory surround area occupy opponent neutral building capture piece remove capture territory limit opponent few square unit building t place
8;Lords of Creation;"In this interesting offering from Warfrog, players become Gods seeking to dominate a world with their followers.  The first part of the game involves constructing the game board, after which players take turns using cards to determine how many new people should appear and what type of terrain they will inhabit.  All tribes start off as barbarians, but soon the calming effect of civilization settles the marauding bands; although civilized tribes score more, they can no longer attack.  What they can do, though, is civilize other players' followers.  Sure it gives opponents more points, but at least those followers won't come after you!&#10;&#10;";1993;6.05322;2.4;2;5;120;12;Civilization, Fantasy;interesting offering warfrog god seek dominate world follower involve construct card determine new people appear terrain inhabit tribe start barbarian soon calming effect civilization settle marauding band civilized tribe long attack civilize follower sure give opponent follower t come
9;El Caballero;"Although referred to as a sequel to El Grande, El Caballero shares few aspects with its namesake, being a fun but intense brain-burner in which players explore and attempt to control the lands and waterways of the New World.&#10;&#10;The players are following Columbus by exploring the islands he discovered. Players slowly explore the islands &ndash; by picking and placing land tiles that are most favorable to them &ndash; and discover wealth in the form of gold and fish. As they learn about the land and sea areas of this new land, they position their caballeros to try to maintain control of the important regions. Castillos give them a measure of protection from others, and ships allow them to establish trade and to fish for food. Success is measured in the size of land and sea areas they control. Their success is measured twice, and in the end these scores are summed and the winner declared.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.46943;2.9515;2;4;90;13;Exploration;refer sequel el grande el caballero share aspect namesake fun intense brain burner explore attempt land waterway new world follow columbus explore island discover slowly explore island ndash pick place land tile favorable ndash discover wealth form gold fish learn land sea area new land position caballero try maintain important region castillo measure protection ship allow establish trade fish food success measure size land sea area success measure twice end sum winner declare
10;Elfenland;"Elfenland is a redesign of the original White Wind game Elfenroads.  The game is set in the mythical world of the elves.  A group of fledgling elves (the players) are charged with visiting as many of the twenty Elfencities as they can over the course of 4 rounds.  To accomplish the task they will use various forms of transportation such as Giant Pigs, Elfcarts, Unicorns, Rafts, Magic Clouds, Trollwagons, and Dragons.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:  Players begin in the Elf capitol, draw one face down movement tile, and are dealt eight transport cards and a secret 'home' city card that they must reach at the end of the 4th round or lose points for each city space away from 'home' they are at the end of the game. Markers of each player's color are placed in each city on the board and are collected when the player visits that city (each counts as 1 point).&#10;  &#10;     The round proceeds in 2 stages.  The first part of the round consists of the drawing of Tiles showing the differing types of transport (except rafts) from a combination of face up and face down tiles (if a player doesn't like the 5 tiles that are face up; they can always draw blind from the face down tiles and hope to get one they need).  These transport tiles need to match the Transportation cards in your hand to use them most effectively.  After each player has a total of 4 tiles they take turns placing a tile on any one of the roads that run between the elf cities.  Only one transport tile may be placed on each road; so players may use other players tiles to travel if they have the matching cards in their hand.  This frequently causes a readjustment of planned travel routes as other players tiles can allow you to move farther or shorter than you had first thought.  Players can play their tiles to help themselves or hinder others by playing a slow mode of transport on another players (perceived) path.&#10;&#10;Each mode of transport has certain terrain it can travel through quickly or slowly, and those that it cannot. These are listed on the top of each transportation card by the number terrain symbols.  The number of terrain symbols equals how many matching cards you must play to move across a given tile in a given terrain.  For example, a Magic Cloud tile placed in a mountain would take one Magic cloud card to travel across (1 mountain symbol on card means Magic clouds are fast in mountains). If the same tile was placed on a road in forest terrain it would require 2 Magic Cloud cards to travel that route (2 Forest symbols on card means Magic Clouds are slow in Forest).  Magic Clouds cannot travel in desert terrain at all (no desert symbols on card). All modes of transport are different and Rafts can be used on rivers or lakes without needing tiles. Rafts go slow upstream (2 raft cards needed) and fast downstream (1 card needed).  The small lake requires 1 raft card to travel across and the larger lake requires 2 cards to travel across.  Players may keep one unused transport counter and up to 4 Transportation cards from one round to the next.&#10;&#10;The second part of the round begins after all players have finished placing their transportation tiles for the round.  Each player plays his cards and moves his elf-boot around the board collecting his tokens from the cities visited.  If there is a Transport tile on a route and a player has no matching Transportation card he may 'Caravan' across it by playing any 3 Transportation cards from his hand.&#10;&#10;As a bit of 'take that' each player has a trouble tile which can be placed next to any transportation tile during the first part of the round.  This counter means that in order to travel that path an additional card of the transport type must be played or 4 cards to 'Caravan'.&#10;&#10;Victory: if at the end of round 3 a player has visited all 20 cities he is the winner.  If not the game ends after round 4 when 'Home' cities are revealed and each player subtracts points for each city he is away from his 'home' subtracting that from his collected city tokens.  The person with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.67221;2.1511;2;6;60;10;Fantasy, Travel;elfenland redesign original white wind elfenroad set mythical world elf group fledgling elve charge visit elfencitie course accomplish task use form transportation giant pig elfcart unicorn raft magic cloud trollwagon dragon begin elf capitol draw face tile deal transport card secret home city card reach end th city space away home end marker color place city collect visit city count proceed stage consist drawing tile show differ transport raft combination face face tile doesn t like tile face draw blind face tile hope need transport tile need match transportation card hand use effectively total tile place tile road run elf city transport tile place road use tile travel match card hand frequently cause readjustment plan travel route tile allow far short think tile help hinder slow transport perceive path transport certain terrain travel quickly slowly list transportation card number terrain symbol number terrain symbol equal matching card give tile give terrain example magic cloud tile place mountain magic cloud card travel mountain symbol card mean magic cloud fast mountain tile place road forest terrain require magic cloud card travel route forest symbol card mean magic cloud slow forest magic cloud travel desert terrain desert symbol card transport different raft river lake need tile raft slow upstream raft card need fast downstream card need small lake require raft card travel large lake require card travel unused transport transportation card second begin finish place transportation tile card elf boot collect token city visit transport tile route matching transportation card caravan transportation card hand bit trouble tile place transportation tile mean order travel path additional card transport card caravan end visit city winner end home city reveal subtract city away home subtract collect city token person high
11;Bohnanza;"Bohnanza is the first in the Bohnanza family of games and has been published in several different editions, including a 2023 version with flowers.&#10;&#10;This entry lists a few different major card sets for Bohnanza: the base game for 3-5 players, the expanded game with the same name for 2-7 players (that is, first expansion included), and Bohnanza Pocket.&#10;&#10;In the game, you plant, then harvest bean cards in order to earn coins. Each player starts with a hand of random bean cards, and each card has a number on it corresponding to the number of that type of beans in the deck. Unlike in most other card games, you can't rearrange the order of cards in hand, so you must use them in the order that you've picked them up from the deck &mdash; unless you can trade them to other players, which is the heart of the game.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you must plant the first one or two cards in your hand into the &quot;fields&quot; in front of you. Each field can hold only one type of bean, so if you must plant a type of bean that's not in one of your fields, then you must harvest a field to make room for the new arrival. This usually isn't good! Next, you reveal two cards from the deck, and you can then trade these cards as well as any card in your hand for cards from other players. You can even make future promises for cards received right now! After all the trading is complete &mdash; and all trades on a turn must involve the active player &mdash; then you end your turn by drawing cards from the deck and placing them at the back of your hand.&#10;&#10;When you harvest beans, you receive coins based on the number of bean cards in that field and the &quot;beanometer&quot; for that particular type of bean. Flip over 1-4 cards from that field to transform them into coins, then place the remainder of the cards in the discard pile. When the deck runs out, shuffle the discards, playing through the deck two more times. At the end of the game, everyone can harvest their fields, then whoever has earned the most coins wins.&#10;&#10;The original German edition supports 3-5 players. The English version from Rio Grande Games comes with the first edition of the first German expansion included in a slightly oversized box. One difference in the contents, however, is that bean #22's Weinbrandbohne (Brandy Bean) was replaced by the Wachsbohne, or Wax Bean. This edition includes rules for up to seven players, like the Erweiterungs-Set, but also adapts the two-player rules of Al Cabohne in order to allow two people to play Bohnanza.&#10;&#10;";1997;7.06964;1.6672;2;7;45;12;Card Game, Farming, Negotiation;bohnanza bohnanza family publish different include flower entry list different major card set bohnanza base expand include bohnanza pocket plant harvest bean card order earn coin start hand random bean card card number correspond number bean deck unlike card t rearrange order card hand use order ve pick deck mdash trade heart plant card hand field field hold bean plant bean field harvest field room new arrival usually isn t good reveal card deck trade card card hand card future promise card receive right trading complete mdash trade involve active mdash end draw card deck place hand harvest bean receive coin base number bean card field beanometer particular bean card field transform coin place remainder card discard pile deck run shuffle discard deck time end harvest field earn coin original german support english rio grande come german include slightly oversized box difference content bean weinbrandbohne brandy bean replace wachsbohne wax bean include seven like erweiterung set adapt al cabohne order allow people bohnanza
12;Ra;"Ra is an auction and set-collection game with an Ancient Egyptian theme.  Each turn players are able to purchase lots of tiles with their bidding tiles (suns).  Once a player has used up his or her suns, the other players continue until they do likewise, which may set up a situation with a single uncontested player bidding on tiles before the end of the round occurs.  Tension builds because the round may end before all players have had a chance to win their three lots for the epoch.  The various tiles either give immediate points, prevent negative points for not having certain types at the end of the round (epoch), or give points after the final round.  The game lasts for three &quot;epochs&quot; (rounds).  The game is easy to learn.&#10;&#10;From the Box:&#10;The game spans 1500 years of Egyptian history in less than an hour!&#10;The players seek to expand their power and fame and there are many ways to accomplish this: Influencing Pharaohs, Building monuments, Farming on the Nile, Paying homage to the Gods, Advancing the technology and culture of the people.

13;CATAN;"In CATAN (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine which resources the island produces. Players build structures by 'spending' resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) which are represented by the relevant resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore, fields produce wheat, and pastures produce sheep.&#10;&#10;Set-up includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each depicting one of the five resource-producing terrain types--or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. A number disk, the value of which will correspond to the roll of two 6-sided dice, are placed on each terrain tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are placed on intersections and borders of the terrain tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which terrain tiles their last-placed settlement is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of rolling the dice, collecting resource cards based on this dice roll and the position of settlements (or upgraded cities&mdash;think: hotels), turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, possibly playing a development card, or trading resource cards with other players. If the dice roll is a 7, the active player moves the robber to a new terrain tile and steals a resource card from another player who has a settlement adjacent to that tile.&#10;&#10;Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road or the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), s/he announces this and claims the win.&#10;&#10;";1995;7.09405;2.2875;3;4;120;10;Economic, Negotiation;catan settler catan try dominant force island catan build settlement city road dice determine resource island produce build structure spend resource sheep wheat wood brick ore represent relevant resource card land exception unproductive desert produce specific resource hill produce brick forest produce wood mountain produce ore field produce wheat pasture produce sheep set include randomly place large hexagonal tile depict resource produce terrain desert honeycomb shape surround water tile contain port exchange number disk value correspond sided dice place terrain tile give settlement think house road stick place intersection border terrain tile collect hand resource card base terrain tile place settlement adjacent robber pawn place desert tile consist dice collect resource card base dice position settlement upgrade city mdash think hotel resource card possible desire improvement trading card port possibly development card trading resource card dice active robber new terrain tile steal resource card settlement adjacent tile accumulate build settlement city have long road large army development card gather certain development card simply award gather hold secret announce claim
14;Basari;"Basari is a game of gem merchants competing in a marketplace&quot;: racing, collecting, trading, and predicting what the other merchants will do.&#10;&#10;To start the game, players receive 12 gemstones (3 each of 4 colors). &#10;Each turn there will be a movement phase and an action phase:&#10;&#10;For movement, everyone simultaneously rolls their die and moves their markers around a track.&#10;&#10;They then choose one of three different actions to perform. The actions are:&#10;- to take a variety of gems from a market stall, &#10;- to immediately score from between 4 and 7 points, or &#10;- to roll and move again and also collect points.&#10;&#10;The action cards are revealed simultaneously. If only 1 player chose a particular action, they simply perform that action. If 2 players chose the same action, they barter back and forth with gemstones. One player will eventually accept the other's offer of gems, and the other will take the action. If 3 or 4 players all chose the same action card, that action is cancelled. Note that in 4-player games, there will always be a conflict in choice of 3 actions, so much more negotiating goes on.&#10;&#10;A new turn begins with everyone rolling their die, moving, then choosing and revealing their action cards. When any merchant piece completes a lap around the board, the round ends and bonus points are awarded based on who has the majority in each gem color and who has completed a lap. After three rounds, the game is over and the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Edel, Stein & Reich&#10;&#10;&#10;";1998;6.74684;1.8478;3;4;25;10;Negotiation;basari gem merchant compete marketplace racing collect trading predict merchant start receive gemstone color action simultaneously die marker track choose different action perform action variety gem market stall immediately collect action card reveal simultaneously choose particular action simply perform action choose action barter forth gemstone eventually accept offer gem action choose action card action cancel note conflict action negotiating go new begin die choose reveal action card merchant piece complete lap end bonus award base majority gem color complete lap high implement edel stein reich

17;Button Men;"This game gained a quick following after one of the major gaming conventions of 1999.  It features several characters, represented on actual stickpin buttons, that each have a unique allowance of polyhedral dice.  These dice endow each  character with fairly unique combat abilities.  Players roll the dice against each other and take their opponents' dice as casualties.  The object of the game is take out the most die 'sides' during the combat.  It's quite simple, quite inventive, and deeper than it would seem at first.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.36326;1.52;2;2;5;10;Collectible Components, Dice, Fighting, Print & Play;gain quick following major gaming convention character represent actual stickpin button unique allowance polyhedral dice dice endow character fairly unique combat dice opponent dice casualty object die side combat simple inventive deep
18;RoboRally;"The robots of the RoboRally automobile factory spend their weekdays toiling at the assembly line. They put in hard hours building high-speed supercars they never get to see in action. But on Saturday nights, the factory becomes a world of mad machines and dangerous schemes as these robots engage in their own epic race.It takes speed, wits, and dirty tricks to become a racing legend! Each player chooses a robot and directs its moves by playing cards. Chaos ensues as all players reveal the cards they've chosen. Players face obstacles like industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyor belts -- but those can also be used to their advantage! Each player aims to make it to each of the checkpoints in numerical order. The first player to reach all of the checkpoints wins. &#10;&#10;In RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.&#10;&#10;In general, players will first fill all of their robot's &quot;registers&quot; with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it!&#10;&#10;Robots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style.&#10;&#10;The game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in 2005.&#10;&#10;UPC 742818050029&#10;&#10;";1994;7.05045;2.4285;2;8;120;12;Maze, Miniatures, Racing, Science Fiction;robot roborally automobile factory spend weekday toil assembly line hard hour build high speed supercar action saturday night factory world mad machine dangerous scheme robot engage epic race take speed wit dirty trick racing legend choose robot direct card chaos ensue reveal card ve choose face obstacle like industrial laser gape pit conveyor belt advantage aim checkpoint numerical order reach checkpoint roborally different robot race dangerous factory floor place navigate robot specific order combine different way accommodate different count race long short desire general fill robot register facedown card happen simultaneously time element involve don t act fast force place card randomly fill rest start register reveal card card high number resolve reveal card example card degree leave right forward space backward space big variety plan perfect route robot run push course disastrous t reprogram card fix robot fire laser factory element resolve robot damage damage certain card fixed long change destroy entirely robot claim correct order award tournament style reprint avalon hill hasbro wotc upc
19;Wacky Wacky West;"A long time ago, in a village far, far away, some disturbed townsfolk decided to destroy their entire town in order to rid themselves of an evil menace (it's technically a dog-mouse, but I think it's an idiomatic thing).  Anyway, so the villagers rebuilt all the buildings in the town (including their precious outhouses), but forgot to include city walls, a river, or roads.  To rectify this, players lay tiles with one of these three things onto the board, and any building caught underneath them is automatically eliminated, except for outhouses.  When an outhouse would be destroyed, players take a vote on whether to place that particular section.  Each player is trying to retain the most of one type of building, and once all the pieces have been placed the winner is the person with the highest valued buildings still standing.&#10;&#10;Wacky, Wacky West re-make description:&#10;&#10;Fans of Klaus Teuber will be interested in this remake/redesign of Drunter und Dr&uuml;ber, a 1991 Spiel des Jahres winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;Just south of nowhere, there's the junction of the Mayfair &amp; Rossdorf RR and the Turvy Trunk Line. Springing up from the desert like a tumbleweed lies the eccentric little town of Rossdorf. Like most western towns, Rossdorf has a Land Agent: Guy Dough, the brother of that wicked varmint Black Benny. A shrewd opportunist, Guy's done sold all the town land ('ceptin' the outhouses) four times over! Every acre in town that ain't got an outhouse on it is owned by the miners, the railroads, AND the fort captain. Just about a year ago, miners digging in the shadow of Fort Rossdorf struck the mother lode! But it wasn't gold, and it wasn't silver. No, my friend, it was just a little spring. Not any ordinary spring, though! It was a torrent of that mind-marbling drink the locals call &quot;Wacky Water!&quot; &#10;&#10;&#10;Now that water's done what the sun and the wind couldn't do: it's made those landholders brave enough to take matters into their own hands. Now they'll use whatever means they can to bowl over the competition and lay claim to the only fertile spots left in town! Now the only thing stoppin' 'em is the Town Charter Amendment #5, which states: &quot;no landholder may move, remove, or detonate any outhouse without a majority vote of the Town Citizens...&quot; Now one thing's for sure: something's gonna stink in Rossdorf, purty darn soon.....&#10;&#10;&#10;In Wacky Wacky West you and your fellow townfolk place track tiles, street tiles, and river tiles hoping to destroy your rivals' buildings. Every time someone tries to build over a precious outhouse, the town votes! You try to enlist your supporters (represented by cards) to vote with you to stop or encourage the play of certain tiles-perhaps saving some of your buildings or taking out those of your dastardly opponents.&#10;&#10;";1991;6.27644;1.8204;2;4;45;9;American West, Bluffing, City Building;long time ago village far far away disturb townsfolk decide destroy entire town order rid evil menace technically dog mouse think idiomatic thing villager rebuild building town include precious outhouse forget include city wall river road rectify lie tile thing building catch underneath automatically eliminate outhouse outhouse destroy vote place particular section try retain building piece place winner person high value building stand wacky wacky west description fan klaus teuber interested remake redesign drunter und dr uuml ber spiel des jahres winner south junction mayfair amp rossdorf rr turvy trunk line spring desert like tumbleweed lie eccentric little town rossdorf like western town rossdorf land agent guy dough brother wicked varmint black benny shrewd opportunist guy sell town land ceptin outhouse time acre town ain t get outhouse own miner railroad fort captain year ago miner dig shadow fort rossdorf strike mother lode wasn t gold wasn t silver friend little spring ordinary spring torrent mind marbling drink local wacky water water sun wind couldn t landholder brave matter hand ll use mean bowl competition lie claim fertile spot leave town thing stoppin em town charter amendment state landholder remove detonate outhouse majority vote town citizen thing sure go to stink rossdorf purty darn soon wacky wacky west fellow townfolk place track tile street tile river tile hope destroy rival building time try build precious outhouse town vote try enlist supporter represent card vote stop encourage certain tile save building take dastardly opponent
20;Full Metal PlanÃ¨te;"In this game of science fiction strip mining, players land on a planet and try and grab as much ore as possible and take off before the game is over.  Each player has tanks, boats, barges, mining equipment and a base ship at his disposal and will have to contend with the weather and the other miners.  The game uses an action point allowance system and thus is dice free.  Each player on his turn has a pool of points that he can divide in a variety of ways, putting all the points into one unit's movement or dividing them among several units.  Each turn is timed so players have to think quickly, and once a move has been made it cannot be retracted.  The game itself is beautifully put together, with a detailed hex grid and real metal miniatures for all of the units.&#10;&#10;Online Play: &#10;&#10;    Full Metal Galaxy&#10;    Full Metal Program&#10;    VASSAL module&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Full Metal Conqu&#195;&#170;te (as a two-player version)&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Full Metal Planete: Plateau Modulaire.&#10;&#10;&#10;Microbadges:&#10; - Full Metal Plan&egrave;te fan  Buy It&#10;&#10;";1988;7.50139;3.1429;2;4;90;12;Miniatures, Science Fiction;science fiction strip mining land planet try grab ore possible tank boat barge mining equipment base ship disposal contend weather miner use action allowance dice free pool divide variety way put unit divide unit time think quickly retract beautifully detailed hex grid real metal miniature unit online metal galaxy metal program vassal module implement metal conqu te expand metal planete plateau modulaire microbadge metal plan egrave te fan buy

22;Magic Realm;"From the 2nd edition rulebook intro for MAGIC REALM:&#10;&#10;MAGIC REALM is a game of fantasy adventuring, set in a land filled with monsters, fabulous treasures, great warriors, and magicians. The scene is set in the ruins of a mighty kingdom, now inhabited by sparse groups of natives and swarms of monsters. Beneath it all are the rich remnants of a magical civilization, scattered and lost across the map.&#10;To this scene come the adventurers, seekers of riches and fame, to make a name for themselves in this promising field. Swordsman and Dwarf, Magician and Sorceror, the humans and the half-humans come seeking to loot the legendary riches of a lost civilization. Now you can play the part of one of these adventurers, stepping into an unknown Realm of magic and monsters, battles and treasures.&#10;&#10;As a player, you will take on the role of one of the sixteen major characters who are represented in detail in the game. You will control where he goes, what he tries to do, how he handles himself in combat, and much more. In the course of the game, you will run into deadly monsters, tribes of humans ranging from old friends to sworn enemies, and treasures that will enhance your abilities in many ways.&#10;&#10;MAGIC REALM is a complex game designed to recapture the suspense and desperate struggles of fantasy literature. The game creates a small but complete fantasy world, where each game is a new adventure with a new map where everything lies hidden at new locations. The game includes many more playing pieces than are actually used in a single playing. The additional pieces are set up and can appear, depending on the directions in which the characters explore, but many of the treasure troves, treasures, and spells will still be set up, unfound, when the game ends, and many of the monsters and natives might never be met. The result is an extremely unpredictable game full of surprises, a game that plays very differently each time it is played.&#10;The complete game system includes hiking, hiding and searching, fatigue, wounds, rest, trade, hiring natives, and combat between characters, monsters, and natives using a variety of weapons on horseback and afoot, as well as many magical effects.&#10;&#10;Between exploring a new land where the mountains, caves, valleys, and woods change every game, and not knowing what you will find in each place, you will find each game a new and unpredictable adventure, filled with surprises. You will find this like no other board game you have ever played.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 9&#10;&#10;See also the list of articles about Magic Realm in The General.&#10;&#10;";1979;7.29996;4.562;1;16;240;12;Adventure, Exploration, Fantasy, Fighting;nd rulebook intro magic realm magic realm fantasy adventure set land fill monster fabulous treasure great warrior magician scene set ruin mighty kingdom inhabit sparse group native swarm monster beneath rich remnant magical civilization scatter map scene come adventurer seeker rich fame promising field swordsman dwarf magician sorceror human half human come seek loot legendary rich lost civilization adventurer step unknown realm magic monster battle treasure role sixteen major character represent detail go try handle combat course run deadly monster tribe human range old friend swear enemy treasure enhance way magic realm complex recapture suspense desperate struggle fantasy literature create small complete fantasy world new adventure new map lie hide new location include piece actually single additional piece set appear depend direction character explore treasure trove treasure spell set unfound end monster native meet result extremely unpredictable surprise differently time complete include hike hiding search fatigue wound rest trade hire native combat character monster native variety weapon horseback afoot magical effect explore new land mountain cave valley wood change know find place find new unpredictable adventure fill surprise find like avalon hill complexity rating list article magic realm general

And there is a mighty army to be raised before the player can lay siege to the tower and fight either to glorious victory or crushing defeat.&#10;&#10;Dark Tower was technologically impressive when it was released in 1981.  Gameplay was facilitated by a small computer inside the black plastic shell of the tower itself.

Players attempt to figure out not simply the spelling but the actual letter structure of the hidden words.&#10;&#10;Players take turns putting one letter segment in a letter box on another player's board; they get a point if the segment belongs to that letter and the other player gets a point if it doesn't.

41;Can't Stop;"In this Sid Sackson classic, players must press their luck with dice and choose combinations tactically to close out three columns. The board has one column for each possible total of two six-sided dice, but the number of spaces in each column varies: the more probable a total, the more spaces in that column and the more rolls it takes to complete. On their turn, a player rolls four dice and arranges them in duos: 1 4 5 6 can become 1+4 and 5+6 for 5 &amp; 11, 1+5 and 4+6 for 6 &amp; 10, or 1+6 and 4+5 for 7 &amp; 9. The player places or advances progress markers in the open column(s) associated with their chosen totals, then chooses whether to roll again or end their turn and replace the progress markers with markers of their color. A player can only advance three different columns in a turn and cannot advance a column which any player has closed out by reaching the end space; if a roll doesn&rsquo;t result in any legal plays, the turn ends with that turn&rsquo;s progress lost.&#10;&#10;A predecessor from 1974, The Great Races, exists as a paper-and-pencil game.&#10;&#10;";1980;6.92532;1.1439;2;4;30;9;Dice;sid sackson classic press luck dice choose combination tactically close column column possible total sided dice number space column vary probable total space column take complete dice arrange duos amp amp amp place advance progress marker open column associate choose total choose end replace progress marker marker color advance different column advance column close reach end space doesn rsquo t result legal end rsquo progress predecessor great race exist paper pencil
42;Tigris & Euphrates;"Regarded by many as Reiner Knizia's masterpiece, Tigris &amp; Euphrates is set in the ancient fertile crescent with players building civilizations through tile placement. Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized. Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board, i.e., external conflicts, with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict. Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts.&#10;&#10;Starting in the Mayfair edition from 2008, Tigris &amp; Euphrates included a double-sided game board and extra components for playing an advanced version of the game. This &quot;ziggurat expansion&quot;, initially released as a separate item in Germany for those who already owned the base game, is a special monument that extends across five spaces of the board. The monument can be built if a player has a cross of five civilization tokens of the same color by discarding those five tokens and replacing them with the ziggurat markers, placing a ziggurat tower upon the middle tile. The five ziggurat markers cannot be destroyed. All rules regarding monuments apply to the ziggurat monument as well. If your king is inside the kingdom of the ziggurat, you will get one victory point in a color of your choice at the end of your turn.&#10;&#10;Some versions of Tigris &amp; Euphrates are listed as being for 2-4 players, while others incorrectly state that they're for 3-4 players. Tigris &amp; Euphrates is part of what is sometimes called Reiner Knizia's tile-laying trilogy.&#10;&#10;";1997;7.70218;3.4959;2;4;120;14;Abstract Strategy, Ancient, Civilization, Territory Building;regard reiner knizia masterpiece tigris amp euphrate set ancient fertile crescent build civilization tile give different leader farm trading religion government leader collect category end number weak category encourage overly specialize conflict arise civilization connect e external conflict leader survive conflict leader replace civilization internal conflict start mayfair tigris amp euphrate include double sided extra component advanced ziggurat initially release separate item germany own base special monument extend space monument build cross civilization token color discard token replace ziggurat marker place ziggurat tower middle tile ziggurat marker destroy monument apply ziggurat monument king inside kingdom ziggurat color end tigris amp euphrate list incorrectly state tigris amp euphrate call reiner knizia tile lay trilogy
43;Airlines;"Airlines' theme is exactly as suggested by the title. The game is similar to the Sid Sackson classic, Acquire, in that players are competing to become majority stockholders in several highly-abstracted companies with the player owning the most valuable portfolio at the end being the winner.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player chooses from one of two actions: expand an airline and put stock into his hand, or play stock from his hand. Expanding an airline adds to its route(s) on the board and increases its value but the trick is that when a scoring card shows up (randomly), only played stock counts as a player's holdings.&#10;&#10;";1990;6.57678;2.4242;2;6;90;12;Aviation / Flight, Economic;airlines exactly suggest title similar sid sackson classic acquire compete majority stockholder highly abstract company own valuable portfolio end winner choose action expand airline stock hand stock hand expand airline add route increase value trick card show randomly stock count holding
44;David & Goliath;"This game adds a very interesting twist to the standard trick-taking genre.  There are five suits and players must follow suit, if they can.  However, the winner of the trick is the highest card played, regardless of suit.  The winner gets all the cards from the trick, minus the card he won it with.  That card is given to the player that played the lowest card.  After all tricks have been played, the scoring begins.  Players score the face-value of the cards in the suits that they only collected one or two of, and one point per card for suits with more than two.  The player with the most points after a number of hands wins the game.&#10;&#10;";1997;6.49205;1.623;3;6;60;8;Card Game;add interesting twist standard trick take genre suit follow suit winner trick high card regardless suit winner get card trick minus card card give low card trick begin face value card suit collect card suit number hand
45;Perudo;"Liar's Dice, a.k.a. Bluff, Perudo or Dudo, is a South American dice game in which each player is given five dice and cup to roll and hide them with. Players make successively higher declarations regarding the results of all the dice remaining in the game, e.g. &quot;there are ten sixes&quot;. However, someone can always contest the bid. When that happens, all the dice are revealed and either the bidder or the caller loses dice, depending on who was correct. The last player with dice is the winner.&#10;&#10;As a public domain dice game, there are a number of variants or similar games called Liar's Dice. This includes one that is often played with Poker Dice, and differs from the marketed versions in that players only declare on their own hand's value (as opposed to all dice being in play), using poker-hand values.&#10;&#10;";1800;6.92315;1.2518;2;6;30;8;Bluffing, Children's Game, Dice, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Party Game;liar dice k bluff perudo dudo south american dice give dice cup hide successively high declaration result dice remain e g six contest bid happen dice reveal bidder caller dice depend correct dice winner public domain dice number similar call liar dice include poker dice differ marketed declare hand value oppose dice poker hand value
46;Medici;"Another Reiner Knizia standby, this game plays very well with varying numbers of people.  The object is to accrue the most points during three rounds, which you do by spending your points to bid on sets of cards.  Each turn the current player turns up one to three cards for all the players to bid on, with the highest bid taking all cards.  The cards denote a commodity type and quantity/value.  The round ends when each player's ships are full, or the commodity card deck is exhausted.  After each round, points are awarded to each player having the most of a given commodity, and to the one with the most valuable total &quot;cargo load&quot;.&#10;&#10;Part of the Knizia auction trilogy.&#10;One of the Knizia Florentine auction games.&#10;&#10; Related Games: &#10;&#10;&#10;     Medici vs Strozzi (two-player version)&#10;     Strozzi&#10;     Mercator, included in Neue Spiele im alten Rom (ancestor to Medici).&#10;&#10;&#10;";1995;7.18231;2.2212;2;6;60;10;Renaissance;reiner knizia standby vary number people object accrue spend bid set card current card bid high bid take card card denote commodity quantity value end ship commodity card deck exhaust award have give commodity valuable total cargo load knizia auction trilogy knizia florentine auction relate medici vs strozzi strozzi mercator include neue spiele m alten rom ancestor medici
47;Chinatown;"This is a negotiation game in the truest sense of the word. In it, players acquire ownership of sections of city blocks then place tiles, representing businesses, onto the block-sections.  At the end of each turn, each tile you've laid gives you some sort of payout, but completed businesses (formed of three to six connected tiles of the same type) pay quite a bit better.  All these resources are dealt to the players randomly, however, so players must trade to get matching businesses and adjacent locations.&#10;&#10;This game is #2 in the Alea big box series.&#10;&#10;";1999;7.43746;2.2359;3;5;60;12;City Building, Economic, Negotiation;negotiation true sense word acquire ownership section city block place tile represent business block section end tile ve lay give sort payout complete business form connect tile pay bit well resource deal randomly trade match business adjacent location alea big box series
48;Krieg und Frieden;"Taking on the roles of land-owners in a feudal society, players are charged with running their lands and accruing favor from the bishop by building his cathedral.  Each turn, players use their resources to bid for that year's agenda, and some resources have more or less value in the bid depending on what type of agenda is available.  Then players use their remaining resources to build their lands, sack others' lands, bribe others' knights away from defense, or help to build the bishop's cathedral.  Finally, players harvest new resources for the next turn.  After all the pieces of the cathedral have been built, the game is over with the victory going to the player with the most victory points.  This game was originally released as Charlemagne by Think Games at Essen 1998, and later slightly shortened as Krieg und Frieden.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Charlemagne&#10;&#10;&#10;";1999;6.09079;2.4638;2;4;90;12;Medieval, Political;take role land owner feudal society charge run land accrue favor bishop build cathedral use resource bid year agenda resource value bid depend agenda available use remain resource build land sack land bribe knight away defense help build bishop cathedral finally harvest new resource piece cathedral build go originally release charlemagne think essen later slightly shorten krieg und frieden implement charlemagne
49;Mamma Mia!;"Designer Uwe Rosenberg has a talent for dreaming up new and inventive card games, and Mamma Mia! is a perfect example of this talent, with players placing pizza ingredients into a combined pool, then trying to time their pizza baking in order to make use of what's available in the kitchen.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with eight different pizza orders to fill, with one of those order cards in hand; each player also starts with a hand of ingredient cards (showing pepperoni, mushroom, pineapple, green pepper or olive). On a turn, a player lays down one or more ingredient cards of a single type into a common stack, then optionally adds a pizza order card to that stack. He then refills his hand by drawing as many cards as he played from either the shared ingredient deck or his own order deck.&#10;&#10;After the draw pile is exhausted, the shared pile of cards is flipped over and sorted by ingredients until an order comes up. If enough ingredient cards are available to fill that order, the owner scores it; if not, the player can make up the difference by playing cards from his hand (and thereby scoring the order) or else return the card to the bottom of his order deck.&#10;&#10;Once all the orders are scored or returned, shuffle the ingredients used in pizzas and start another round of play. After three complete rounds, the player who's filled the most orders wins!&#10;&#10;";1998;6.48129;1.362;2;5;30;10;Card Game, Memory;designer uwe rosenberg talent dream new inventive card mamma mia perfect example talent place pizza ingredient combine pool try time pizza bake order use available kitchen start different pizza order fill order card hand start hand ingredient card show pepperoni mushroom pineapple green pepper olive lay ingredient card single common optionally add pizza order card refill hand draw card share ingredient deck order deck draw pile exhaust share pile card sort ingredient order come ingredient card available fill order owner difference card hand order return card order deck order return shuffle ingredient pizza start complete fill order
50;Lost Cities;"Lost Cities is a card game in the Kosmos two-player series. The game originally consisted of a single deck of cards of rank 2&ndash;10 in five different colors with three special &quot;handshakes&quot; (&quot;HS&quot; in scoring examples below) in each suit, but as of 2018 the game now includes six colored suits, with the sixth color being optional for gameplay. A game board is included to organize discarded cards and help players organize their card collections.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the colored suits of cards. On a player's turn, they must first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the color-appropriate discard pile, then draw one card, either from the deck or from the top of a discard pile. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order, but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.&#10;&#10;The game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the deck. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total; one handshake doubles an expedition's value, while two handshakes triples that value and three handshakes quadruple it. Expeditions start at a value of -20, so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least eight cards played into it. A complete game of Lost Cities lasts three matches, with scores for each match being added together.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 1: An expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30. This expedition is worth 10 total points: 30 plus the initial -20.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 2: An expedition has 2 HS, and 4,5,6,7,8,10 for a total of 40. This expedition is worth 80 total points: 40 points for cards, plus the initial -20, &times;3 for the two multipliers, plus the 20-pt bonus for playing 8+ cards.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 3: An expedition has 1 HS, and 4,6,7 for a total of 17. This expedition is worth -6 total points: 17 plus the initial -20, &times;2 for the multiplier.&#10;&#10;";1999;7.24936;1.476;2;2;30;10;Card Game, Exploration, Math;city card kosmos series originally consist single deck card rank ndash different color special handshakes hs example suit include colored suit sixth color optional include organize discard card help organize card object gain mount profitable archaeological expedition different site represent colored suit card card expedition discard color appropriate discard pile draw card deck discard pile card expedition ascend order need consecutive handshake consider low represent investment expedition red red card high future long handshake continue fashion alternate final card take deck rest card hand discard expedition expedition card card expedition worth rank handshake count multipli final total handshake double expedition value handshake triple value handshake quadruple expedition start value card expedition order profit leave negative value handshake multipli apply bonus award expedition card complete lost city last match match add example expedition total expedition worth total plus initial example expedition hs total expedition worth total card plus initial time multiplier plus pt bonus card example expedition hs total expedition worth total plus initial time multipli

There's a four-piece modular board that forms a large room with walls spread around the board. There are also color-coded targets on boards. Placed on top of the surface are four robots. The idea for each turn/puzzle is to get the like-colored robot to a randomly selected target. The trick is that once a robot starts moving, it will continue to move until a wall or another robot stops it. Therefore, players are seeking a sequence of moves for the robots that will enable them to move the required robot to the target in the fewest moves.&#10;&#10;";1999;7.0339;2.3801;1;99;30;10;Abstract Strategy, Maze, Puzzle, Real-time;ricochet robot puzzle explain odd number solution possible piece modular form large room wall spread color code target place surface robot idea puzzle like colored robot randomly select target trick robot start continue wall robot stop seek sequence robot enable require robot target few

64;Joan of Arc;"Joan of Arc, a game of &quot;Conquest and Perfidy in the Kingdom of France&quot;, deals with the conflicts in France during the Hundred Years' War.  It's a multiplayer wargame with a card-driven combat system and a political layer that players must contend with.&#10;&#10;For just over one hundred years England and France battled over who would sit on the French throne. Even within France itself factions developed, putting forth their own candidates challenging the rights of the Dauphin. From this struggle heroes emerged, notably the Black Prince and Jeanne d'Arc, The Maid of Orleans. Tremendous battles were fought at Crecy, Poitiers and Agincourt, yet their impact on the war was ephemeral. Long sieges followed short campaigns, bands of the notorious Free Companies, temporarily unemployed, marauded across the countryside in search of rapine and plunder. Complicating matters, both famine and plague poisoned the seasons. All in all, 'twas a grand time!&#10;&#10;The game randomly lasts from 8 to 10 turns.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player with the most Pretender Points.  &#10;Points are gained at the end of each turn for each Province a player controls.  &#10;Controlled cities gain revenue. Those can be spent on Battle Cards and fortification.&#10;&#10;Battles are resolved by playing Battle Cards (yellow(numerical) or red(special cards), combined with Influence, fortifications, and die roll.&#10;&#10;TURN SEQUENCE&#10;Income phase: based on controlled cities&#10;Political phase: vote for War or Peace&#10;Battle Cards collection  &#10;Purchase fortifications and/or cards.  &#10;Player Order phase&#10;Event(s) phase&#10;Foreign Intervention phase&#10;Player Turns: In player order, each player resolves:  &#10;1-Expansion moves&#10;2-Combat only if 2+ Yellow cards; Resolve battle, then repeat combat if needed.&#10;Pretender Points: Players gain points (depending on regions they control), then Influence points (up to 6), then discard all cards.&#10;GAME END: check on turn 8 and 9, automatic on 10&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;1 mounted game board &#10;80 cards (a la Tarot) &#10;20 resin cast castles and 10 resin cast strongholds &#10;die-cut coin markers and garrisons representing the factions of France, England, Navarre, Brittany, Flanders and Burgandy.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Sequel Renaissance&#10;&#10;&#10;";1998;6.28019;2.5424;3;6;150;10;Card Game, Medieval, Political, Wargame;joan arc conquest perfidy kingdom france deal conflict france year war wargame card drive combat political layer contend year england france battle sit french throne france faction develop put forth candidate challenge right dauphin struggle hero emerge notably black prince jeanne d arc maid orleans tremendous battle fight crecy poitier agincourt impact war ephemeral long siege follow short campaign band notorious free company temporarily unemployed maraud countryside search rapine plunder complicate matter famine plague poison season twa grand time randomly last winner pretender gain end province city gain revenue spend battle card fortification battle resolve battle card yellow numerical red special card combine influence fortification die sequence income base city political vote war peace battle card purchase fortification card order event foreign intervention order resolve combat yellow card resolve battle repeat combat need pretender gain depend region influence discard card end check automatic component mount card la tarot resin cast castle resin cast stronghold die cut coin marker garrison represent faction france england navarre brittany flander burgandy sequel renaissance

67;Conquest;"Conquest was designed to be a diceless wargame.  Its latest version updates the original with plastic units and a colorful map.  Set in ancient times, Conquest has players utilizing troops, cavalry, chariots, elephants and ships to try to capture their opponents' fortifications or occupy the &quot;quest&quot; locations.  The map is designed for point-to-point movement, and play hinges on a pool of action points that each side uses to move its different units.

71;Civilization;"Civilization is a game of skill for 2 to 7 players. It covers the development of ancient civilizations from the invention of agriculture c. 8000 B.C. to the emergence of Rome around the middle of the third century B.C. Each player leads a nation of peoples over a map board of the Eastern Mediterranean and Near East as they attempt to carve a niche for themselves and their culture.&#10;&#10;Although battles and territorial strategy are important, this is not a war game because it is not won by battle or conquest. Instead, the object of play is to gain a level of overall advancement involving cultural, economic, and political factors so that such conflicts that do arise are a result of rivalry and land shortage rather than a desire to eliminate other players. Nomad and farmer, warrior and merchant, artisan and citizen all have an essential part to play in the development of civilization. It is the player who most effectively changes emphasis between these various outlooks who will achieve the best balance and win.&#10;&#10;(from the Introduction to the Avalon Hill edition rulebook)&#10;&#10;This game has a huge following and is widely regarded as one of the best games about ancient civilizations. Each player takes on the role of leader of an ancient civilization, such as the Illyrians or Babylonians. Your task is to guide your people through the ages by expanding your empire and using its proceeds to finance new technological advances, such as Literacy, Metalworking, or Law. The advancements help your civilization better cope with its problems as well as help bring new advancements.&#10;&#10;Civilization is widely thought to be the first game ever to incorporate a &quot;technology tree,&quot; allowing players to gain certain items and abilities only after particular other items were obtained.

75;Falling;"This game is from an odd genre, real-time card games.  Each of the players (except the dealer) is a person falling to his death.  The goal is not to live, rather just to be the last one to go splat.  The dealer continues dealing cards to players, eventually giving them 'ground' cards.  But on the way down players can do all kinds of nasty stuff to each other to ensure their relative longevity.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.50551;1.218;4;8;5;8;Card Game, Fantasy, Print & Play, Real-time;odd genre real time card dealer person fall death live splat dealer continue deal card eventually give ground card way kind nasty stuff ensure relative longevity
77;EastFront: The War in Russia, 1941-45;"EastFront details the conflict between Germany and the Soviet Union during WWII.  Players have to contend with production, supply, command control and whether to try and break the other side's lines.  Several scenarios cover every major point of the war.  The game comes with a fantastic, detailed map of Eastern Europe and Russia printed on cardstock and many wooden blocks for the units.  This is a stand alone game that can also serve as one element of the complete EuroFront series which covers the entire European conflict of WWII.&#10;&#10;This title uses the Columbia Games Block system.  While there are variations in the rule sets, all of the &quot;Front&quot; series of games are based on the block system.  Basically this means that rather than using traditional counters to represent units on the map the game uses wooden blocks that stand upright with unit details only shown on one side.  This accomplishes two things:  First it provides an easy way of producing a &quot;fog of war&quot; because your opponent cannot tell, save through good memory or deduction, what type of unit a specific piece is or its current strength.  Second, having the blocks stand on end allows the possibility of rotating a block so the current strength is the top number.  Although most war games have some type of mechanism that allows units to take losses in steps of their overall strength, counters normally have at most two steps because they only have two sides.  Blocks, however, have four so you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide.&#10;&#10;With the use of blocks, Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding complex layers of bookkeeping, allowing interesting and relatively short sessions of play.&#10;&#10;";1991;7.67447;3.6;2;2;240;12;Wargame, World War II;eastfront detail conflict germany soviet union wwii contend production supply command try break line cover major war come fantastic detailed map eastern europe russia print cardstock wooden block unit stand serve element complete eurofront series cover entire european conflict wwii title use columbia games block variation set series base block basically mean traditional represent unit map use wooden block stand upright unit detail show accomplish thing provide easy way produce fog war opponent tell save good memory deduction unit specific piece current strength second have block stand end allow possibility rotate block current strength number war mechanism allow unit loss step overall strength normally step side block easily track twice detail war provide use block columbia provide way add good deal depth war add complex layer bookkeeping allow interesting relatively short session

It comes with a beautiful card-stock map from Vicksburg to Cincinnati and heaps of wooden blocks for the North and South.  The game utilizes both a strategic layer of the conflict but also provides a slightly more tactical layer of combat with additional battle maps that allow for center, and flank positions of specific units.

91;Paths of Glory;"(from GMT Games' website:)&#10;&#10;They called it the Great War. In over four years of titanic struggle, the ancient Europe of Kings and Emperors tore itself to pieces, giving birth to our own violent modern age. The bloody battles fought in the trenches of the Western Front, the icy plains of Poland, the mountains of the Balkans, and the deserts of Arabia, shaped the world we know today. We are all orphans of the Great War.&#10;&#10;Paths of Glory: The First World War, designed by six-time Charles S. Roberts awards winner, Ted Raicer, allows players to step into the shoes of the monarchs and marshals who triumphed and bungled from 1914 to 1918. As the Central Powers you must use the advantage of interior lines and the fighting skill of the Imperial German Army to win your rightful 'place in the sun.' As the Entente Powers (Allies) you must bring your greater numbers to bear to put an end to German militarism and ensure this is the war 'to end all wars.' Both players will find their generalship and strategic abilities put to the test as Paths of Glory's innovative game systems let you recreate all the dramatic events of World War I.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;     316 full-color die-cut counters:&#10;         176 5/8&rdquo; die cut counters&#10;         140 1/2&rdquo; die cut counters&#10;    &#10;     One 22x34&quot; full-color mapsheet showing most of Europe and the Near East&#10;     110 Strategy Cards&#10;     32-page Rule Book including sample game replay (21 pages of actual rules)&#10;     Two Player Reference Cards &#10;&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Ted Raicer&#10;DEVELOPER: Andy Lewis&#10;ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

The game covers WWI from its outbreak to American intervention and spans all of Europe and the Middle East.  Not only is the game innovative, but it also plays fast, usually within just an evening.&#10;&#10;While the game itself has all of the normal expectations of a wargame, with various units, CRT charts and period chrome, at heart the game rests within the card play.  Players are given a hand of cards to play out six sub-phases of a turn.  Each sub-phase allows for the use of a card or a pass with a minimal movement of units.  Each card has four possible uses: operational movement, strategic movement, special events, and replacement points.

93;El Grande;"In this award-winning game, players take on the roles of Grandes in medieval Spain.  The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions.  To that end, you draft caballeros (knights) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions.  After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).&#10;&#10;A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards vary from round to round.&#10;&#10;The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had there into the region you secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande and in the region containing the king.&#10;&#10;";1995;7.76343;2.9434;2;5;120;12;Medieval, Renaissance;award role grande medieval spain king power flag powerful lord vie region end draft caballero knight court subsequently help seize region region ninth winner select power card determine order number caballero province general supply court personal supply consist select action card allow variation additional opportunity addition determine caballero court region castillo secretive tower normally place caballero region adjacent contain king hard fast el grande king region action card available allow king new region action card vary caballero majority region castillo possible follow castillo place cube region secretly indicate region dial region individually accord table print region bonus award have sole majority region contain grande region contain king
95;Igel Ãrgern;"Translated literally, the title means &quot;Hedgehog Irking&quot; (or a bit more loosely, &quot;Annoying the Hedgehogs&quot;), but the game is usually referred to in English as &quot;Hedgehogs in a Hurry.&quot; This game gives players several wooden disks (the hedgehogs) to place in one of six rows.  During a turn, you roll a die, optionally move any of your hedgehogs one row left or right, then move any hedgehog (not necessarily yours!) in the row your rolled forward one space.  But watch out for black spaces; hedgehogs caught there can't continue moving until they're in last place.  The first player to get three of their four hedgehogs to the end of the board wins.

97;Conquest of the Empire;"Conquest of the Empire is part of Milton Bradley&#039;s Gamemaster series.  It is set during the Roman Empire and depicts the struggle around the Mediterranean as rival factions attempt to take control of the empire.  Each player plays one of these factions and receives a Caesar figure, several general figures, and ships of a specific color.  Along with these leaders, players utilize a pool of generic units composed of infantry, cavalry, and catapults.  All game pieces are plastic figures.&#10;&#10;Players attempt to conquer their neighbors and build up cities and fortifications to increase production of wealth.  Players also may build road networks that allow for faster movement, by all armies.  Along the way players have to contend with rising inflation which makes military units more and more expensive.  Eventually through elimination one player pulls ahead for the win.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Eagle Games&#039;s Conquest of the Empire (2005)&#10;&#10;&#10;";1984;6.29748;2.5294;2;6;240;10;Ancient, Economic, Wargame;conquest empire milton bradley gamemaster series set roman empire depict struggle mediterranean rival faction attempt empire faction receive caesar figure general figure ship specific color leader utilize pool generic unit compose infantry cavalry catapult piece plastic figure attempt conquer neighbor build city fortification increase production wealth build road network allow fast army way contend rise inflation make military unit expensive eventually elimination pull ahead implement eagle games conquest empire
99;Fortress America;"Fortress America, originally part of Milton Bradley's Gamemaster series, depicts an alternate near-future in which all of the world attacks and invades the continental United States. From the west arrives hordes of Asian foes; from the south arrives a union of South American countries through Mexico, and from the east lands come legions of Soviets who have taken over all of Europe. America besieged has to rely on the remaining ground and air forces left in the country along with partisan uprisings to defend mom's apple pie.&#10;&#10;Up to four players can play Fortress America, one player being the U.S. and up to three others controlling the invading units from a particular direction. Being a near future scenario, the units in the game include conventional infantry, APCs, hovertanks, helicopters, bombers, US partisan units, and special &quot;Star Wars&quot; laser relay systems that fire from space.&#10;&#10;The game emphasizes combined arms in that players receive a bonus if infantry, mechanized, and air power are all used in a conflict. For the invading countries, all the units they receive for the game are given at the start so they must manage them wisely. The U.S., however, starts with a skeleton defense and builds up throughout the game through a random deck of cards. Further, the U.S. slowly builds up its Star Wars system, so the longer the invaders are delayed, the more powerful the U.S. becomes both conventionally and through its defense system.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Fortress America (2012)&#10;&#10;&#10;";1986;6.72281;2.6305;2;4;180;12;Modern Warfare, Science Fiction, Wargame;fortress america originally milton bradley gamemaster series depict alternate near future world attack invade continental united states west arrive horde asian foe south arrive union south american country mexico east land come legion soviet take europe america besiege rely remain ground air force leave country partisan uprising defend mom apple pie fortress america u invade unit particular direction near future unit include conventional infantry apc hovertank helicopter bomber partisan unit special star war laser relay fire space emphasize combined arm receive bonus infantry mechanized air power conflict invade country unit receive give start manage wisely u start skeleton defense build random deck card u slowly build star war long invader delay powerful u conventionally defense reimplemente fortress america
101;Detroit-Cleveland Grand Prix;"This game is part of a family which includes Top Race, Daytona 500, and Formel 1.  Players are dealt a hand of cards which have movement numbers for one or more of the cars.  When a card is played, the cars are advanced the number of spaces indicated in order from top to bottom.  However, if the track is blocked, then that movement is lost, so the idea is to use the cards that help your opponents (which you'll likely have to play eventually) only when they won't be able to take advantage of the movement.&#10;&#10;";1996;6.77692;1.713;2;6;60;8;Card Game, Racing;family include race daytona formel deal hand card number car card car advance number space indicate order track block idea use card help opponent ll likely eventually t able advantage
103;Titan;"This classic game of the Fantasy Monster Slug-a-thon is a standby from the The Avalon Hill Game Co of yore.  The game still has a very devoted following, which is a tribute to the depth of the various strategies and approaches.  The game is divided into two realms, the masterboard and the battleboards.  On the masterboard, legions of mythical creatures roam about trying to recruit bigger and badder monsters and kill opposing legions in the process.  When a combat occurs, the action moves to the corresponding battleboard type corresponding to the area the fight is taking place in.  After lots of dice are tossed, the army that remains standing is returned to the masterboard with the spoils of war: points.&#10;&#10;The points are used to recruit Angels and Archangels and to augment the leader character of the player's army: The Titan.  As the points increase, the Titans become ever more powerful; at game end, the titan is able to kill most other character with a single blow. But be careful: If the Titan dies, the player is out of the game.&#10;&#10;The last Titan standing is the ruler of all, and winner of the game.&#10;&#10;";1980;6.96394;3.4642;2;6;240;12;Fantasy, Wargame;classic fantasy monster slug thon standby avalon hill co yore devoted following tribute depth strategy approach divide realm masterboard battleboard masterboard legion mythical creature roam try recruit big badder monster kill oppose legion process combat occur action correspond battleboard correspond area fight take place lot dice toss army remains stand return masterboard spoil war recruit angel archangel augment leader character army titan increase titans powerful end titan able kill character single blow careful titan die titan standing ruler winner
105;Colossal Arena;"Colossal Arena/Titan:The Arena is a strategic card game for 2 to 5 players: you play, not as combatants, but as spectators, cheering and betting on the melee ongoing in a fantasy arena/colosseum in which fantasy creatures are pitted against each other in battle!&#10;&#10;Each round one of the creatures will die. To decide which unlucky soul will be the victim, players put numbered power cards in front of the creatures, with the lowest one going to the graveyard.  The jockeying for position and strategic diplomacy in playing the numbered power cards can be intense - but what makes this game even more interesting is that the players' place bets throughout the game which will sometimes allow them to use a creature's special power in battle!&#10;&#10;The winner at the end of the game is the bettor who's raked in the most winnings - just another day in the life of a fantasy monster gambler.&#10;&#10;Titan: The Arena is actually a reworking of a Reiner Knizia game called Grand National Derby, but The Avalon Hill Game Co's remake was quite significant from a gameplay standpoint.&#10;&#10;The Titan: The Arena printing is often confused with its namesake, Titan.

107;Peaceful Resistance;"This small-publisher game comes with loads of wooden hex-shaped tiles, a hex board, and three pawns.  The object of the game is to move your pawn from one corner of the hex board to the opposite corner.  However, instead of taking your move, you can place a hex tile on the board.  These are used to block your opponent, because while your pawn can always go down any number of hex tiles, it can only step up one level at a time.&#10;&#10;";1995;5.72353;1.0;2;3;30;0;Abstract Strategy;small publisher come load wooden hex shape tile hex pawn object pawn corner hex opposite corner instead take place hex tile block opponent pawn number hex tile step time
109;Wettstreit der Baumeister;"Jean du Po&#195;&#171;l put this game out on the market for about a year before the game's name was changed to Wettstreit der Baumeister in 1998.&#10;&#10;This translates to &quot;Contest of the Architects&quot;. The game has a beautiful assortment of large, thick tiles to represent the cities. Players bid on a single building tile every turn, with half the proceeds going to the auctioning player. When a player is ready to start construction of his city, the tiles are laid out in order with the single restriction that not two touching tiles are the same type. The building types are city halls, churches, towers, and gates. When the one of the two draw piles is exhausted, the cities are judged for symmetry, with the highest scoring city winning.&#10;&#10;Rules apply to either game:&#10;&#10;Within two decks of 20 cards are contained the City Wall, Towers and Gates, Churches, City Halls, etc. During play, one of the decks lies face up, the other face down. There are three parts to each player's turn. First, the player rolls a die in an attempt to better his finances (1 to 5 on the die; the sixth side gives a sabotage-counter instead). Second, he alone may look at the top hidden card before he makes an offer on either of the two top cards from the two decks. The other players then bid on the two cards. If the player (the Auctioneer) makes the highest bid, he may take the card and pay the bank. If, on the other hand, one of the other players buys the card, that player pays half the money to the bank and half to the Auctioneer. Third, a player may either build (lay down another card on his city) or sabotage a City Card of another player. The player receiving the sabotage must then pay the value of the card or remove it.&#10;&#10;The game ends when either of the decks is depleted.&#10;&#10;";1994;6.11169;1.9643;3;4;45;10;City Building;jean du po l market year change wettstreit der baumeister translate contest architect beautiful assortment large thick tile represent city bid single building tile half proceed go auction ready start construction city tile lay order single restriction touching tile building city hall church tower gate draw pile exhaust city judge symmetry high city apply deck card contain city wall tower gate church city hall etc deck lie face face part die attempt better finance die sixth give sabotage instead second look hide card make offer card deck bid card auctioneer make high bid card pay bank hand buy card pay half money bank half auctioneer build lie card city sabotage city card receive sabotage pay value card remove end deck deplete
111;RheinlÃ¤nder;"This Reiner Knizia game, produced by Hasbro&#039;s European division, casts players in the roles of dukes who are trying to establish duchies along the banks of the Rhine River.  Players hold a hand of cards that correspond to numbered plots on each bank, and they place knights in open plots for which they hold the corresponding cards.  After establishing duchies, players attempt to expand them to include more plots of land, as well as buildings - such as castles, cathedrals, and cities. These buildings both add to the value of a duchy and provide their owners with advantages during game play.  Combined with a uniquely Knizia-style scoring system, this game has some very interesting dynamics.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.65568;2.3139;3;5;45;12;Abstract Strategy, Medieval, Territory Building;reiner knizia produce hasbro european division cast role duke try establish duchy bank rhine river hold hand card correspond numbered plot bank place knight open plot hold correspond card establish duchy attempt expand include plot land building castle cathedral city building add value duchy provide owner advantage combine uniquely knizia style interesting dynamic
113;Plotters, Inc.;"Plotters, Inc., first released as Mit List und T&uuml;cke (&quot;With Cunning and Treachery&quot;), is a trick-taking game with quite a few twists. The deck consists of cards in four suits, and the deck is adjusted based on the player count so that everyone receives a hand of 14 cards to begin a round. At the start of a trick, the lead player plays any card, setting trump for that trick. Each other player plays any card that they like &mdash; except that once three colors of cards have been played, the fourth color cannot be played. Whoever plays the highest trump card wins the trick and collects two of the cards played (or three cards in a game with five or six players), placing these cards in front of them. Whoever plays the lowest non-trump card collects the remaining cards; this player leads to the next trick.&#10;&#10;Once a player has cards of all four colors in front of them, they must choose two colors and leave cards of this color face up, placing all other cards face down. As they collect more cards, they place them face up or face down based on their colors. The round ends after 14 tricks or when a player would be forced to play a card of the fourth color to a trick; in this latter case, the round ends immediately. Each player then scores the cards they've collected. For their two face-up colors, they multiply these numbers together; they then divide this product by the number of cards that they placed face down, rounding this number down. For example, if you have 6 yellow cards, 4 red cards, and 2 blue cards, then you have (6 &bull; 4)/2 = 12 points. If you collect cards of only one color, then you score 0 points!&#10;&#10;Play as many rounds as the number of players.

115;I'm the Boss!;"The six Investor cards are shuffled and one is dealt face up to each player. Any Investor cards not dealt to the players are set aside for now. The Influence Card deck is shuffled and each player is dealt five cards face down. The player whose Investor is first in alphabetical order goes first. The player to the starting player&rsquo;s right places the Dollar marker on any space on the game board.&#10;&#10;Each space on the game board represents a potential deal which Investors have to approve the deal and the number of dividends to be paid to those investors.&#10;&#10;On one&rsquo;s turn, a player can open negotiations on the deal where the Dollar marker rests or roll the six-sided die. If the player rolls the die, the Dollar marker is advanced clockwise around the game board counting the available deals as spaces. Once the Dollar marker rests, the player may try to negotiate that deal or draw three Influence cards. If by drawing cards, the player&rsquo;s hand exceeds twelve the player chooses which cards to discard to the limit.&#10;&#10;Should a player choose to make the deal, the player negotiates with the player or players representing the Investors how to divide the money at stake. The amount is number of dividends written on the space multiplied by value of the shares written on the deal tile. Any or all of the players may use their Influence cards to affect the outcome of the deal:&#10;&#10;&bull;    Clan cards may act in place of Investors whether the Investors are in play or not.&#10;&bull;    Travel cards put Investors out of play for the negotiations. Some are specific for a given Investor; some are wild to be played on any Investor.&#10;&bull;    Recruitment cards can only be played in sets of three to steal another player&rsquo;s Investor and make it your own.&#10;&bull;    Boss cards give the player control of the negotiations.&#10;&bull;    Stop cards immediately stop the effects of Travel, Recruitment, and Boss Influence cards.&#10;&#10;The players are paid from the bank when a deal has been struck. The game board space is covered with the Deal tile (effectively closing the space from further game play), the Dollar marker is moved to the next open space, and play continues with next player.&#10;&#10;Once nine deals have been made, a die is rolled after each subsequent deal to determine whether the game ends (with the odds increasing each time).

On your turn you simply draw a tile and decide where to place it, extending the network of tiles already on the board.&#10;&#10;Several refinements make this simple proposition into an engrossing game.  First, each tile is 3x1 (to be played on a 19x19 board) and has exactly three outlets (potential connection points). Second, your score is not simply the number of spots you've reached on one edge added to the number of spots you've reached on the other, but is the product of those two numbers.  So you can't just concentrate on one side and ignore the other, because zero times anything is still zero.  Third, on each side of the board there are three special points which score double if reached, adding a dab of focus to the choices.&#10;&#10;Interestingly, you need to play both offense and defense and will often have to decide to which use to put a particular tile.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.94747;2.0662;2;4;45;10;Abstract Strategy;ta y uuml connection try extend start tile center reach western eastern edge oppose try reach northern southern edge simply draw tile decide place extend network tile refinement simple proposition engrossing tile x x exactly outlet potential connection second simply number spot ve reach edge add number spot ve reach product number t concentrate ignore zero time zero special double reach add dab focus interestingly need offense defense decide use particular tile
119;Cosmolancer;"Auf Heller und Pfennig takes participants to a medieval marketplace. Each turn, players place tiles onto the grid board that modify (either positively or negatively) the amount of money to be made by the shops that share that tile's row or column. Three times the board is filled with tiles and shop money is earned, after which the player with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;In Kingdoms, the first English-language version of Auf Heller und Pfennig, players try to collect the most gold by establishing castles in the richest regions of the realm while avoiding hazards like dragons, swamps, and trolls. The 2011 edition includes detailed plastic castles, a streamlined rulebook, and the addition of a wizard tile &mdash; one that increases the rank of adjacent castles, multiplying their scores &mdash; previously available only at game conventions.&#10;&#10;As of 2024, Cosmolancer is the newest version of this design, with players taking the role of freelance photographers...in space!

On a turn, you either:&#10;&#10;&bull; Draw a tile and place it in an empty space on the 6x5 grid.&#10;&bull; Place the tile in your hand.&#10;&bull; Place one of your tokens, which are numbered 1-4, in an empty space.&#10;&#10;When all of the spaces are filled, you score each of your tokens, multiplying the number on the token by the sum of the tiles in its row and column, with some special tiles nullifying positive values or splitting a row into two segments.

121;Dune;"Set thousands of years in the future, Dune the board game is based on the Frank Herbert novels about an arid planet at the heart of the human space empire's political machinations.&#10;&#10;Designed by the creators at Eon of Cosmic Encounter fame, some contend that the game can best be described as Cosmic Encounter set within the Dune universe, but the two games bear little in common in the actual mechanisms or goals; they're just both set in space. Like Cosmic Encounter, it is a game that generates player interaction through negotiation and bluffing.&#10;&#10;Players each take the role of one of the factions attempting to control Dune. Each faction has special powers that overlook certain rules in the game. Each turn players move about the map attempting to pick up valuable spice while dealing with giant sandworms, deadly storms, and other players' military forces. A delicate political balance is formed amongst the factions to prevent any one side from becoming too strong. When a challenge is made in a territory, combat takes the form of hidden bids with additional treachery cards to further the uncertainty.&#10;&#10;The game concludes when one faction (or two allied factions) is able to control a certain number of strongholds on the planet.&#10;&#10;Note that the Descartes edition of Dune includes the Duel Expansion and Spice Harvest Expansion, the Landsraad variant from Avalon Hill's General magazine, and additional character disks not provided by AH.&#10;&#10;";1979;7.58628;3.4498;2;6;180;12;Bluffing, Fighting, Negotiation, Novel-based, Political, Science Fiction;set thousand year future dune base frank herbert novel arid planet heart human space empire political machination creator eon cosmic encounter fame contend well describe cosmic encounter set dune universe bear little common actual mechanism set space like cosmic encounter generate negotiation bluffing role faction attempt dune faction special power overlook certain map attempt pick valuable spice deal giant sandworm deadly storm military force delicate political balance form faction prevent strong challenge territory combat take form hidden bid additional treachery card uncertainty conclude faction allied faction able certain number stronghold planet note descartes dune include duel spice harvest landsraad avalon hill general magazine additional character disk provide ah

Whoever bid the highest sum takes the four cards to the left or right of the deck or another player's bid, adds these cards to their hand, then places their bid next to the deck or in front of the player whose bid they took. (Alternatively, the player can return their bid to hand.) Then the next player with the highest bid resolves their bid similarly. Once all players have resolved their bids, draw cards from the deck to refill the lots to the left and right of the deck to four cards. When the deck runs out, play one final round, then score your cards in hand.&#10;&#10;If you have 200 or more in a single currency, score that many points.

Although there is a rescue attempt in the works, it's still a month away.  In the meantime, the characters will have to live off the land or off of each other depending on how it goes.  Players attempt to guide the members of their group around the island, keeping them alive with the food they find in the desert.  However if their foraging is less than successful, finding some poor schmuck's meaty thigh is a viable substitute.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.13096;2.5455;2;6;120;18;Exploration, Horror;frischfleish fresh flesh represent unique group individual strand desert island rescue attempt work month away meantime character live land depend go attempt guide member group island keep alive food find desert foraging successful find poor schmuck meaty thigh viable substitute
135;Kontor;"Kontor is a two-player tile-laying game which can also be played by two teams of two players. The name means 'Trading House' and the players act as merchants vying for supremacy in late 17th century Amsterdam. By building trading houses at the canals you aim to control three major commodities (Spices, Tea and Wine) in each harbor area. During the game you expand by playing Land and Water cards in the large area of the harbor. By the end of the game points are awarded according to ownership of the largest commodity majorities in each harbor area.&#10;&#10;This game has many optional rules, scenarios, expansions and variations.

137;Pass the Bomb;"This frantic game is a wonderful exercise in word-summoning.  In it, players try to come up with a word that contains a certain sequence of letters before the ticking time-bomb in their hands explodes.  The bomb is an electronic timer with a variable time allotment, and a player is only allowed to pass the bomb to the next person when he comes up with a word that contains the needed letters.  While creative spelling of the words in question can be frowned upon, it's up to the guy next to you to determine your fate.&#10;&#10;Awards&#10;&#10;1996 &#195;&#133;rets Familiespil, Family Game of the Year Denmark&#10;&#10;";1994;5.82183;1.2872;2;10;20;12;Electronic, Party Game, Real-time, Word Game;frantic wonderful exercise word summon try come word contain certain sequence letter tick time bomb hand explode bomb electronic timer variable time allotment allow pass bomb person come word contain need letter creative spelling word question frown guy determine fate award ret familiespil family year denmark
139;Hoax;"The basic idea in Hoax is to pretend to be somebody you are not while working towards the goal of figuring out who other people are. Each player is assigned one of six different characters -- each with its own unique abilities -- but can pretend to be any character and use its corresponding powers.  Abilities are used to acquire 3 different types of goods, which can be spent to get clues to opponents' identities.  If the majority of the other players think you're pretending to be a character that you're not, you must either admit that you are not that character (and permanently lose the use of its power), or reveal that you are and win the game.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented as:&#10;&#10;    Die Erben von Hoax&#10;&#10;&#10;";1981;5.90022;1.3529;3;12;45;10;Bluffing, Deduction, Fantasy, Medieval;basic idea hoax pretend somebody work figure people assign different character unique pretend character use correspond power acquire different good spend clue opponent identity majority think pretend character admit character permanently use power reveal implement die erben von hoax
141;Andromeda;"Each player controls bases/stations (in the form of little wooden cubes) which they use to attempt to build Economic Centers on the moons of seven planets in an alien planetary system.  After moving their tokens on to a planet, players use an interesting little device ('planet ring'/'wormhole' - functions like a blind draw bag) to select one of the tokens on the planet.  Players take actions by collecting sets of cards which correspond to the the various planets.  The game also features a unique trading system which facilitates the card collecting. Careful card trading and calculating risk of establishing economic centers, and some variants, mitigate some of the luck factor.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;Setup: 9 cards/player. Place 1 cube per planet per player, plus additional cube per planet matching cards dealt out; remaining cubes on earth. Each gets 2 special action cards.Each round: First, players may play a single special action card, in order. Then, Trade Step. Finally, Action Step.&#10;&#10;Trade Step: Start player first plays cards (2-3) to offer, one at a time; other players simultaneously show cards to trade, different than offered. Start player must trade; recipient either accepts cards into hand, or leaves out. Clockwise from Start Player, next player with cards still in front of them either makes a trade or takes their cards back. Continue till 0-1 people left with cards in front; they take them back to hand.&#10;&#10;Action Step: Start player takes 3 actions, then others take 2 each. Actions can be:&#10;- discard 2 cards, then draw 2&#10;- turn in set of 3-7 cards to send half (rounding down) as many cubes from earth to a planet&#10;- turn in set of 3-7 cards to advance Ship Level, Tech Level, or to make attempt to establish colony on a planet matching cards played: place cubes on that planet into the cosmic ashtray, randomize, then reveal up to as many cubes as attempts made. If reveal your cube, place it on a station; turn over. If other player's cube, send it back to earth.&#10;- Sets: if no wilds (&quot;pure&quot;), take appropriate bonus wild card matching the size of the set (if available); wilds can be used later as parts of sets&#10;&#10;Then rotate starting player to the left.

151;Piratenbillard;"This interesting dexterity game is played on a table-like board that is a wooden lattice with a piece of linen stretched over the bottom.  Little colored balls are placed in the resulting holes, and then players use long wooden mallets to strike the bottom of the table.  When a ball is hit correctly, it will pop out of the space it's in and land in another space closer to the opposite side of the board.

153;Take 5!;"Relying heavily on his previous effort, 6 Nimmt!, Wolfgang Kramer has transformed it into a more strategic game.  The deck is numbered from 1 to 98, with some of the cards having green bullheads and others having red bullheads.  In this game greens are positive points and reds are negative points.  As in 6 Nimmt!, players are constructing sets of cards, with the fifth card in a set taking the whole thing.  This time, however, players take their turns sequentially and can play one to three cards from their hands.&#10;&#10;In a confusing twist, the Dutch edition of 6 Nimmt! is called Take 5! but is the progenitor game, not this game.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.55906;1.474;2;6;60;10;Card Game, Number;rely heavily previous effort nimmt wolfgang kramer transform strategic deck number card have green bullhead have red bullhead green positive red negative nimmt construct set card fifth card set take thing time sequentially card hand confusing twist dutch nimmt call progenitor
155;Was sticht?;"This is a two-trump, trick-taking card game, with several twists.  At the beginning of the game, players draft tasks they intend to complete in order to win the game.  (Tasks include things like &quot;Take no tricks&quot;, &quot;Take 1 Trick&quot;, or &quot;Take No Red Cards&quot;.)  Then, all of the cards are dealt out in front of the players before each hand.  Row by row, the players draft cards, and the dealer declares who would have won each row's trick, if it had been played that way.  Players use this information to deduce what the trump number and suit are.  After all the cards are drafted, each player - except the dealer - selects one of the task tiles she drafted, which will be her mission for the hand.  The dealer is stuck trying to uniquely accomplish someone else's task for the round - but at least doesn't have to preselect which person's goal he is trying to &quot;steal&quot;.  The hand is then played in the traditional fashion, with each player trying to take tricks or not, based on the goal she selected.  The first player to complete five tasks wins the game.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    M&#195;&#188; and Lots More&#10;&#10;&#10;";1993;6.98204;2.377;3;4;60;12;Card Game, Deduction;trump trick take card twist beginning draft task intend complete order task include thing like trick trick red card card deal hand row row draft card dealer declare row trick way use information deduce trump number suit card draft dealer select task tile draft mission hand dealer stick try uniquely accomplish task doesn t preselect person try steal hand traditional fashion try trick base select complete task implement m lot

The real points come when you slowly reveal your secret plan to him &mdash; or leave him to be eaten by sharks.

Use your initial investment to build track.  Then pick up commodities where they are grown, mined, or manufactured and deliver them to a lucrative place of demand.  Complete a delivery and make the money you need to buy larger, faster trains, and expand your railroad empire.  Win the game by building the most effective railroad empire!&#10;&#10;The original and flagship of Mayfair&#039;s crayon-rails line allows players, using washable crayons, to draw their train routes over a map of North America.  Players start with an initial sum of money which they use to build short lengths of track during their first couple of turns.  For the rest of the game, players operate their trains over the track network drawn on the board to pick up and deliver loads to various cities, and then have the opportunity to add to their track network or improve their train.  The game uses demand cards which list three demands, each of a commodity to be delivered to a specified city for a given payoff.  Each player has three demand cards to provide opportunities for income.&#10;&#10;Each turn consists of an operations phase and a building phase.  During the operations phase, trains are moved to cities where commodities are picked up at no cost and moved to one of the cities on that player's demand cards.  When the commodity is delivered, the player receives the payoff and trades that demand card for a new one.  Event cards are mixed in the deck with the demand cards.  When an event card is drawn the instructions are followed.  During the building phase a player may pay to build more track or upgrade his train.&#10;&#10;A player wins by being the first to connect his track network to six of the seven major cities on the board and acquire $250,000,000 in cash on hand.&#10;&#10;";1982;6.96426;2.6318;2;6;180;12;Economic, Trains, Transportation;epic railroad building north america discover modern north american classic celebrate vital endure passion railroad use initial investment build track pick commodity grow mine manufacture deliver lucrative place demand complete delivery money need buy large fast train expand railroad empire build effective railroad empire original flagship mayfair crayon rail line allow washable crayon draw train route map north america start initial sum money use build short length track couple rest operate train track network draw pick deliver load city opportunity add track network improve train use demand card list demand commodity deliver specified city give payoff demand card provide opportunity income consist operation building operation train city commodity pick cost city demand card commodity deliver receive payoff trade demand card new event card mix deck demand card event card draw instruction follow building pay build track upgrade train connect track network seven major city acquire cash hand

170;Family Business;"Family Business takes mob warfare to a new level of backstabbing, revenge, and general bloodthirstiness, which is what makes it such a blast to play.  Every player controls a 'family' and plays various cards to off other players' family members.  In a game with this little structure, it's possible for everyone to gang up on one unlucky soul, or for the damage to be fairly evenly spread.  Either way, the last family standing is victorious.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a gang of nine characters. To try to get rid of other gangsters, contracts are played on them. If these contracts are not blocked by anyone, the targeted gangster is placed on the hitlist. As soon as six gangsters are on the hitlist a mobwar is started. This means that, at the start of every turn, the first character on this list is eliminated. This goes on until the list is empty.&#10;&#10;Mobwars can also be triggered by cards being played. When no more than the last six or fewer characters are in play a constant mobwar is going on, until only one player has characters left.&#10;&#10;In general players take turns clockwise, however, the turn goes to any player who plays a response card and then clockwise mode is resumed with the player next to him/her.

171;Chess;"Chess is a two-player, abstract strategy board game that represents medieval warfare on an 8x8 board with alternating light and dark squares. Opposing pieces, traditionally designated White and Black, are initially lined up on either side of the board. Each type of piece has a unique form of movement and capturing occurs when a piece, via its movement, occupies the square of an opposing piece. Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture, attack, defend, or develop their positions. Chess games can end in checkmate (when the king cannot escape from the opponent's pieces), resignation (when one player recognizes that defeat is inevitable and ends the game), or one of several types of draws.&#10;&#10;Chess is one of the most popular games in the world, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. Between two highly skilled players, chess can be a beautiful thing to watch, and a game can provide great entertainment even for novices. The 2020 Netflix series, The Queen's Gambit was enjoyed by both chess players and non-players alike. There is also a large literature of books and periodicals about chess, typically featuring games and commentary by chess masters. Chess is so well known and highly regarded that it is often used as a metaphor in journalism, poetry, fiction, and film.&#10;&#10;Chess has its origins in the Indian game Chaturanga, which became Shatranj when introduced to the Persians. The current form of the game emerged in the second half of the 15th century when the Persians brought Shatranj to Southern Europe. The tradition of organized competitive chess began in the 16th century. The first official World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886.

During the game's two distinct phases, players first bid for several buildings then, after all buildings have been bought, sell the buildings for the greatest profit possible.&#10;&#10;The original Ravensburger/FX Schmid edition (1997/98) has slightly different rules than later English editions, and only 20 buildings instead of 30.&#10; The &#195;&#156;berplay 2005 Edition has new art, rules and card distribution changes, and it accommodates 3-6 players.&#10;&#10;The Gryphon 2009 Edition uses the &Uuml;berplay art for the faces of the property cards, while replacing most other art.  The rules are the same as the &Uuml;berplay edition, with the exception of the rounding rule (which was stated in different ways in different printings of the &Uuml;berplay edition).&#10;&#10;Rounding rule&#10;&#10;The rounding rule preferred by the designer Stefan Dorra is that players get back half of their bid rounded DOWN (not UP), as confirmed in correspondence with him here and here.  A history of how the rounding rule has changed in different editions is documented here.&#10;&#10;";1997;7.26127;1.2523;3;6;30;10;Card Game, Economic;sale quick fun nominally buy sell real estate distinct bid building building buy sell building great profit possible original ravensburger fx schmid slightly different late english building instead berplay new art card distribution change accommodate gryphon use uuml berplay art face property card replace art uuml berplay exception rounding state different way different printing uuml berplay prefer designer stefan dorra half bid confirm correspondence history rounding change different document
173;Formula DÃ©;"Formula D&eacute; is a fast-paced racing game in which the cars' top speeds are limited by having to end a certain number of turns in each curve of the racetrack.  This can be tricky, because although players can regulate their speeds by choosing which gear to be in and each gear allows a certain range of movement, the exact amount is determined randomly.   Great fun for a big group.&#10;&#10;A winner of the 1990 Concours International de Cr&#195;&#169;ateurs de Jeux de Soci&#195;&#169;t&#195;&#169;.&#10;&#10;Expanded by: (Ludod&#195;&#169;lire Expansions)&#10;&#10;

174;T-Rex;"Many regard this game as a trick-taking game, however that would be a very liberal interpretation of trick-taking.  Players are each given an equal set of cards, which they randomly pick a hand of seven.  Each hand one suit is a trump suit, and one suit is a non-trump suit.  Players place one of their cards in front of themselves, and this continues until the hand ends.  At that time, the top card on their piles are compared and the best card picks his reward first, and the remaining reward going to the second place.  The reward cards give players points, and the highest total at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.50693;1.9091;3;5;45;10;Card Game;regard trick take liberal interpretation trick take give equal set card randomly pick hand seven hand suit trump suit suit non trump suit place card continue hand end time card pile compare good card pick reward remain reward go second place reward card high total end
175;What the Heck?;"Rarely is a game broken down to its barest elements like this one.  Players are given an equal deck of bidding cards from one to fifteen.  Each turn, a prize tile is randomly selected from a pool.  A prize tile is worth either positive or negative points (from -5 to +10).  Each player is attempting to gather the most positive points from these prizes.  Players secretly select one of their remaining bidding cards and reveal them simultaneously.  For positive prizes, the highest card gets the prize; For negative prizes, the lowest card is stuck with the prize.  However, if two people play the highest (or lowest) card, they cancel each other out and the prize goes to the next in line.  The highest total score after all fifteen prizes are awarded wins.&#10;&#10;";1988;6.48163;1.1636;2;5;20;7;Animals, Bluffing, Card Game;rarely break bare element like give equal deck bidding card prize tile randomly select pool prize tile worth positive negative attempt gather positive prize secretly select remain bidding card reveal simultaneously positive prize high card get prize negative prize low card stick prize people high low card cancel prize go line high total prize award

Except for the brain part - there is, in fact, one brain - that's the premise of Give Me the Brain!, a card game in which players take on the roles of zombies in a fast-food restaurant in hell.  They all have to complete a number of tasks before leaving work, and the work keeps piling on.  Even worse, some of the tasks require basic intelligence and there's only one brain to go around.&#10;&#10;Note: Give Me the Brain: Superdeluxe Edition has 100 cards, instead of 112 with a few cards adjusted from previous versions.&#10;&#10;";1996;5.83541;1.2727;3;8;15;10;Card Game, Zombies;work fast food hell employee zombie t find single brain brain fact brain premise brain card role zombie fast food restaurant hell complete number task leave work work keep pile bad task require basic intelligence brain note brain superdeluxe card instead card adjust previous
177;Advanced Civilization;"The use of the word &quot;Advanced&quot; to describe this expansion followed existing Avalon Hill tradition. &quot;Enhanced&quot; is likely more appropriate.  Playing with this expansion is no more difficult than playing the base Civilization game.  This expansion reworks a few of the original rules, includes a reworked version of Civilization: Expansion Trade Cards Set and adds more civilization advancements to the technology tree.&#10;&#10;Included are more civilization advancements (both quantity and type), which give the players new options for advancement, as well as a slightly restructured commodity trading round, which has new resources and disasters to be traded. The most significant aspect of the game is a restructuring of the advancement/victory conditions, which remove the limits on advancement cards.  Some claim this makes the strategies more homogeneous while others claim the reverse is true.&#10;&#10;";1991;8.00796;3.6651;2;8;480;12;Ancient, Civilization, Economic, Expansion for Base-game, Negotiation;use word advanced describe follow exist avalon hill tradition enhance likely appropriate playing difficult base civilization rework original include rework civilization trade card set add civilization advancement technology tree include civilization advancement quantity new option advancement slightly restructure commodity trading new resource disaster trade significant aspect restructuring advancement condition remove limit advancement card claim make strategy homogeneous claim reverse true
178;Mole Hill;"In this strange little game, players take the roles of a gardener protecting his lawn and a mole digging it up.  The gardener must try to block the mole's moves and fence him in quickly, while the mole must dig as many holes as possible before being caught.&#10;&#10;Essentially, the mole may move any direction, horizontally or diagonally from square to square, while the gardener places boundary sticks down along the edges of the square, which the mole may not cross.  The mole and gardener may either move or place down a boundary stick, and move alternately.  Eventually, the gardener will hem the mole in completely and the round is over.  In addition, if the mole can move into flower beds, extra points are scored.  By moving to the center, the mole may also tunnel deeply to any selected square on the board, thus escaping the (by then) rapidly closing trap of boundary sticks.  Depending on how many moves this took, more or less points are earned by the mole.&#10;&#10;Once points are totaled up, the roles are reversed and another round is played.  The winner is the player who scored the most points as the mole.&#10;&#10;";1997;5.99224;1.7188;2;2;15;8;Abstract Strategy;strange little role gardener protect lawn mole dig gardener try block mole fence quickly mole dig hole possible catch essentially mole direction horizontally diagonally square square gardener place boundary stick edge square mole cross mole gardener place boundary stick alternately eventually gardener hem mole completely addition mole flower bed extra center mole tunnel deeply select square escape rapidly close trap boundary stick depend take earn mole total role reverse winner mole
179;Nuba;"The board is a 5 x 6 grid. Each player has ten tokens, numbered 1 - 9 and one 'X'. Players alternate setting their pieces in the two rows nearest them. The lower the number on the token, the better a wrestler that piece is. The higher the number, the better the musician (but that makes that piece a lousy wrestler). The idea is to get your highest possible piece to the opposite side of the board.&#10;&#10;When a piece successfully reaches the opposite side of the board, it is placed in the honorable musician space. It remains there unless another piece (of either player) with a higher value reaches the opposite side, in which case it supplants this piece as the best musician. The game ends when no one can oust the reigning musician (which means no one has a piece left on the board of a higher value). If a player's piece marked with the 'X' reaches the opposite side, the game immediately ends and that player is victorious.&#10;&#10;A variant is given in which all pieces which cross the board are summed to determine the winner, although a player exiting their 'X' still wins immediately.&#10;&#10;The original magazine publication also suggests playing on a 6x6 board with additional '10' and '11' pieces.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.20585;2.0;2;2;10;12;Abstract Strategy;x grid token number x alternate set piece row near low number token well wrestler piece high number well musician make piece lousy wrestler idea high possible piece opposite piece successfully reach opposite place honorable musician space remain piece high value reach opposite case supplant piece good musician end oust reign musician mean piece leave high value piece mark x reach opposite immediately end victorious give piece cross sum determine winner exit x immediately original magazine publication suggest x additional piece
180;Pool Position;"The setting is pool side at a swanky hotel and players are trying to get their beach towels into the choice locations next to the pool.  Players use equal sets of power cards to determine the number of placement points for each round.  These movement points are then used to place their towels or dislodge others' towels.  However activity in a particular row of towels attracts the attention of the cabana boys, who can eventually lock a row up permanently.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.77071;1.7273;2;5;30;10;Abstract Strategy, Card Game;setting pool swanky hotel try beach towel location pool use equal set power card determine number place towel dislodge towel activity particular row towel attract attention cabana boy eventually lock row permanently
181;Risk;"Possibly the most popular, mass market war game.  The goal is conquest of the world.&#10;&#10;Each player's turn consists of:&#10;- gaining reinforcements through number of territories held, control of every territory on each continent, and turning sets of bonus cards.&#10;-  Attacking other players using a simple combat rule of comparing the highest dice rolled for each side.  Players may attack as often as desired.

182;Hungry;"In this quick, fun, and fairly abstract game, players play cards in an effort to acquire tiles that are either color-coded or number-coded.  Players take turns, first playing a card onto a tile that matches either the card's number or its color, then drawing to refill their hands.  When all cards have been played, each tile is evaluated, and whichever player has the most cards played to that tile gets that tile's points.  After calculating point totals and figuring in bonuses, the player with the highest score is the winner.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.36164;1.4239;2;4;30;8;Card Game, Medieval;quick fun fairly abstract card effort acquire tile color code number code card tile match card number color draw refill hand card tile evaluate whichever card tile get tile calculate total figure bonus high winner
183;Stonehenge;"Stonehenge is a two-player game that has druids competing at Stonehenge to be the Master Druid.&#10;&#10;Each player has 8 coloured megaliths (tall wooden blocks) and 9 matching discs (numbered 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,5, &amp; 6). The board is a triangle of 5 dissecting lines, with the corners lopped off, so the lines are 2,3,4,5,4 spaces long. On each side are 5 extra spaces, where players put their megaliths.&#10;&#10;Players take turns putting down a numbered disc on the intersections of the lines on the board. When you have the majority total in any direction, you claim that line by placing your megalith on the end point. Ties on a line are lost by the last placing player; a clever balancing rule which forces careful choices. The player to get their eighth megalith down wins.&#10;&#10;Stonehenge is the same as Linea (Spielbox 1992, smaller board).&#10;&#10;The Megalith edition is Selection #9 of The Games Collection by Pin International.&#10;&#10;";1994;6.29456;1.8571;2;2;15;10;Abstract Strategy;stonehenge druid compete stonehenge master druid colour megalith tall wooden block match disc number amp triangle dissect line corner lop line space long extra space megalith put numbered disc intersection line majority total direction claim line place megalith end tie line place clever balancing force careful eighth megalith stonehenge linea spielbox small megalith selection pin international
185;Devil Bunny Needs a Ham;"In this wacky Cheapass title, players are Sous Chefs trying to get to the top floor of a skyscraper by scaling the outside.  However the maniacal Devil Bunny is hopping about in a mad lust for blood thinking he'll get a ham by knocking you off.  Yeah, right, whatever.&#10;&#10;The game board is a rectangular grid representing the side of a building, with the starting space at the bottom, and the goal at the top. There is a dotted line near the top that represents a critical height (see below). Furthermore, there are special spaces on the sides of the buildings that represent &quot;fear&quot; that cannot be moved into (As a show of Cheapass Games' signature humor, these fears included &quot;spiders&quot; and &quot;Wesley Snipes.&quot;)&#10;&#10;In the basic game, each player controls two sous-chefs; on each turn, the player rolls two six-sided dice. Any roll other than a 6 can be used to move one or both sous-chefs up the side of the building, either horizontally or on upwards diagonals (a player cannot voluntarily move down the building). If a 6 is rolled, the Devil Bunny token is moved to the highest sous-chef on the board and knocks him off; if there is a sous-chef vertically below the one that was knocked off, the player controlling that one may opt to catch the falling sous-chef, placing the token in the spaces immediately below him. If no player that is able to catch the sous chef offers to help, the chef will crash to the ground. If the chef fell from a height below the marked line on the board, the chef is safe but must restart him climb back from the start. However, if the chef was above this line, the chef is dead, leaving the player with one fewer token to win. The players earn points for the order in which their chefs arrive at the top, and the weighting is such that a player with second and third-place chefs can beat a player with a first-place and a dead (non-scoring) chef.&#10;&#10;Variants include ignoring the effects of the fear spaces (which normally cluster the players into the center columns), and using 3 sous-chef tokens for each player.&#10;&#10;In 2022, Greater Than Games created a boxed edition with upgraded components.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.39836;1.1757;2;5;30;8;Abstract Strategy, Dice, Print & Play;wacky cheapass title sous chef try floor skyscraper scale outside maniacal devil bunny hop mad lust blood think ll ham knock yeah right rectangular grid represent building start space dotted line near represent critical height furthermore special space side building represent fear cheapass signature humor fear include spider wesley snipe basic sous chef sided dice sous chef building horizontally upwards diagonal voluntarily building devil bunny token high sous chef knock sous chef vertically knock opt catch fall sous chef place token space immediately able catch sous chef offer help chef crash ground chef fall height marked line chef safe restart climb start chef line chef dead leave few token earn order chef arrive weighting second place chef beat place dead non chef include ignore effect fear space normally cluster center column sous chef token great create boxed upgrade component

The game still features the patented SPLIT half cards and looks much better than the original (design wise) and seems to have some adjustments to the rules.&#10;&#10;In this surprisingly solid offering from Hasbro, players use cards to take actions on a board.  The cards depict halves of a standard deck of cards, and players attempt to match the halves with those next to the board.  Depending on the quality of the match (perfect, strong, weak), the action is likewise powerful or weak.  The object of the game is to place a series of your markers in a continuous line across the board.  Also the game is scalable for two to six players, with four through six using partners to keep the action interesting.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented as:&#10;&#10;    Split (Revised Edition)&#10;&#10;&#10;";1999;5.93023;1.1333;2;6;30;12;Card Game;new split available publisher gdc gamedevco ltd patent split half card look well original wise adjustment surprisingly solid offering hasbro use card action card depict half standard deck card attempt match half depend quality match perfect strong weak action likewise powerful weak object place series marker continuous line scalable partner action interesting implement split revise
188;Go;"By all appearances,  Go is just two players taking turns laying stones on a 19&times;19 (or smaller) grid of intersections.  But once its basic rules are understood,Go shows its staggering depth. One can see why many people say it's one of the most elegant brain-burning abstract games in history.&#10;&#10;Players place one stone at a time on the board at an empty intersection. The goal of the game is to try to claim the most territory by walling off sections of the board and surrounding or capturing each other's stones.  The game doesn't end until the board fills up, or, more often, when both players agree to end it, at which time whoever controls the most territory wins.&#10;&#10;";-2200;7.65578;3.9253;2;2;180;8;Abstract Strategy;appearance take lay stone time small grid intersection basic understand show staggering depth people elegant brain burn abstract history place stone time intersection try claim territory wall section surround capture stone doesn t end fill agree end time territory
189;Die Siedler von NÃ¼rnberg;"Based on the well-known Settlers of Catan, this stand-alone game published in commemoration of the anniversary of the founding of the city of N&uuml;rnberg gives players some new twists to the familiar experience.  Unlike standard Settlers, the game layout is not modular.  Instead the board features a split map, half of which has the goods-producing hexes of a conventional Settlers game where settlements will be built and the other half showing a closeup of N&uuml;rnberg where &quot;workshops&quot; will be built (in lieu of promoting settlements to cities as in the original Settlers).  The players also get currency for manufactured goods which in turn they spend on walls and towers to surround the city, which earn prestige points which ultimately count toward victory points.  Probably the most interesting other detail is that instead of rolling dice, a special deck of cards is used to reveal the production number -- and possibly an event -- at the beginning of each player's turn.&#10;&#10;Belongs to the Catan Series.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.90314;2.7792;3;4;90;10;Medieval, Negotiation;base know settler catan stand publish commemoration anniversary founding city n uuml rnberg give new twist familiar experience unlike standard settler layout modular instead split map half good produce hex conventional settler settlement build half show closeup n uuml rnberg workshops build lieu promote settlement city original settler currency manufactured good spend wall tower surround city earn prestige ultimately count probably interesting detail instead dice special deck card reveal production number possibly event beginning belong catan series
190;Dolce Vita;"Players are socialites who are trying to take as many high-value luxuries as they can manage.  A number of luxuries (boats, mansions, watches, boats, etc.) of values varying from one million to seven million are laid out in a matrix.  Players take turn placing power cards in the columns, and after five of the six cards have been played, the highest bid takes the first luxury in the column, the second highest gets the next one up, and so on.  However, if you collect a second luxury item you already own, then the newest one replaces the older one, which could mean exchanging a lavish seven million dollar car for a paltry one million dollar one!  After the specified number of rounds, the highest valued collection is deemed the best.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.14089;1.6875;3;5;30;10;Card Game;socialite try high value luxury manage number luxury boat mansion watch boat etc value vary million seven million lay matrix place power card column card high bid take luxury column second high get collect second luxury item new replace old mean exchange lavish seven million dollar car paltry million dollar specify number high value deem good
192;Nicht die Bohne!;"This warped but fun card game is more intense than it first appears to be.  Players try to collect points in four different suits, but along the way points can be made negative instead of positive or even canceled entirely by taking one of the 'Nicht die Bohne' cards.  With its interesting trading mechanism, this game can be a little hard to grasp at first, but it's worth the effort.

193;Fill or Bust;"Fill or Bust is all about rolling dice and pressing your luck. On your turn, roll the dice and set aside at least one die that scores you points. If you want, you can roll the remaining dice &ndash; but if none of those dice score for you, you lose all points accumulated that round!

Of course, this is no picnic, hindered as it is by other players' rampaging armies and the frequent bumbling visitations of Groo the Wanderer, determined by the roll of a set of dice, which can also grant players resources with which to build and 'Groo heads' with which to damage the unfortunates who have Groo in their village.

195;NASCAR Champions;"It looks a bit like Daytona 500 with its oversized racetrack gameboard, but it's a much simpler game.  The main thing going on is that you roll the five dice on your turn and pick which three you want to play.  Each die has the five colors for the five cars in the race and one &quot;checkered flag&quot; side which means you draw a card.  The dice are numbered 1 to 5 (that is, each die has one of the five numbers), and the three you pick have to be played in order.  If you draw a card, it might instruct you to move a particular car, or the car in last place, or to spin a car out; or it might make you a &quot;Sponsor&quot; of a car, meaning you could get prize money for a car other than your main car.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.515;1.1;2;5;30;8;Dice, Racing, Sports;look bit like daytona oversized racetrack gameboard simple main thing go dice pick want die color car race checker flag mean draw card dice number die number pick order draw card instruct particular car car place spin car sponsor car mean prize money car main car
196;Kremlin;"A game of political intrigue set in the Soviet Politburo of the early 20th century, with a satirical edge.  With politicians like Eduard Boremtodev, Nikolai Shootemdedsky and Natasha Nogoodnik vying for control of the party, you know the battle will be an entertaining one.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, a number of politician cards are laid out to fill the positions of the politburo.  Players then secretly note influence on ten politicians they hope to control during the game, indicated by a number from 1 to 10.&#10;Gameplay is not clockwise, but proceeds phase by phase with the politician holding the relevant office performing the appropriate action by the player who reveals the greatest influence on the politician in question.  Players attempt to remove politicians opposed to their interests by purging, exiling them to Siberia or by demoting them within the Politburo.  One&rsquo;s own preferred politicians can be promoted or pardoned of their previous &lsquo;sins&rsquo;. &#10;But each action a politician takes causes him (or in one case, her) to age by one or more years (a measure of the aging effect of the stress of the job). Each turn, politburo members face a health check which can result in the politician becoming ill, or even dying.  The 'older' a politician gets the more likely it is that he (or she) will become ill.&#10;At the end of each turn, the Party Chief must be healthy enough to wave to the crowd at the October parade. Controlling a politician who succeeds at this three times makes you the winner.&#10;&#10;The original Fata Morgana edition included rules requiring the players to hold funeral speeches for deceased party chairmen and drinking vodka with it, for instance. The later Avalon Hill edition scrapped these rules and gave the game a less satirical and more serious tone.&#10;&#10;Jolly Roger reimplemented an edition providing three different KREMLIN games in one box -See Kremlin (Third Edition)-:&#10;&#10;1: The 'original' with fictional politicians, set in a USSR where KGB investigations send those found guilty to Siberia. This version will have victory conditions based on the original Fata Morgana rules.&#10;&#10;2: A version inspired by the Avalon Hill variant titled 'Revolution'. Set in the 1920s, it uses historical politicians as well as fictional politicians. It's a more violent game as those arrested by the KGB are shot and removed from the game&#10;&#10;3: A new version, set in the modern USSR and Russia, an era of entrenched bureaucracy and alternatives for escaping KGB persecution. This version introduces the concept of &quot;Going into Exile&quot; to avoid Siberia. It also includes modern politicians from the 1960s onwards, whether it is Kosygin or Putin and Gorbachev.&#10;&#10;";1986;6.96878;2.8493;3;6;75;12;Negotiation, Political;political intrigue set soviet politburo early th century satirical edge politician like eduard boremtodev nikolai shootemdedsky natasha nogoodnik vie party know battle entertaining start number politician card lay fill position politburo secretly note influence politician hope indicate number clockwise proceed politician hold relevant office perform appropriate action reveal great influence politician question attempt remove politician oppose interest purge exile siberia demote politburo rsquo preferred politician promote pardon previous lsquo sin rsquo action politician take cause case age year measure age effect stress job politburo member face health check result politician ill die old politician get likely ill end party chief healthy wave crowd october parade politician succeed time make winner original fata morgana include require hold funeral speech deceased party chairman drinking vodka instance late avalon hill scrap give satirical tone jolly roger reimplemente provide different kremlin box kremlin original fictional politician set ussr kgb investigation send find guilty siberia condition base original fata morgana inspire avalon hill title revolution set use historical politician fictional politician violent arrest kgb shoot remove new set modern ussr russia era entrenched bureaucracy alternative escape kgb persecution introduce concept go exile avoid siberia include modern politician onwards kosygin putin gorbachev
197;HellRail: Second Perdition;"Based on Dante&#039;s Inferno, HellRail: 2nd Perdition has players creating rail to deliver the souls of the damned to the appropriate circles of Hell.  The card mechanics are clever, as every card can become a load to be delivered, or be used to build rail, move trains, or draw more cards.  Additionally, upon arriving at each circle, players have the choice to call forth that circle's powers, possibly putting a serious crimp in their opponents' efforts.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    HellRail&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented as:&#10;&#10;    FrachtExpress&#10;    HellRail: Third Perdition&#10;&#10;&#10;";1999;6.04218;2.0;3;4;75;13;Card Game, Trains, Transportation;base dante inferno hellrail nd perdition create rail deliver soul damned appropriate circle hell card clever card load deliver build rail train draw card additionally arrive circle forth circle power possibly put crimp opponent effort implement hellrail implement frachtexpress hellrail perdition

Ultimately, each player seeks to have built the tallest buildings in the most city blocks of the Island.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players will play a card that illustrates which part of a city block they may place a &quot;floor&quot; on a building. The placement card is unique for each player in that the section they may place in is relative to their seating at the table. The player who has placed the top most floor controls that building. Each round, scores are tallied based on control of each of the neighborhoods.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the player who has scored the most points through area control and tallest buildings wins.&#10;&#10;Note: In the Finnish edition, the districts are named after six great cities of the world: Hong Kong, Sao Paulo, Cairo, Sydney, Frankfurt and Manhattan.&#10;&#10;(Espa&ntilde;ol)&#10;&#10;En Manhattan los jugadores construyen un 'skyline' de rascacielos en distintos distritos o zonas de la isla de Manhattan.

In short - if your Entdecker's board has a scout trail leading to native huts, it's not this Entdecker.]&#10;&#10;Entdecker starts with a blank game board that represents an unexplored sea. Tiles are drawn and placed on squares on the board. As the tiles are placed islands develop on the board and players pay to place settlements, bases, or scouts on these islands in an effort to become the most powerful discoverer of all. Completed islands yield victory points to all who have invested in exploration on an island, but of course the most points go to the player who has established the strongest presence.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Die Neuen Entdecker or Entdecker: Exploring New Horizons&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     In 2004, a smaller version of the Entdecker game was released, based on the online version available on the www.playcatan.de site.&#10;         Oceania.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     In 2007, the game system was revamped in a new &quot;Entdecker&quot;-series of 3 titles (so far):&#10;         Im Reich der Jadegottin (published 2007)&#10;         Im Reich der W&#195;&#188;stensohne (published 2008)&#10;         Im Reich der D&auml;monen (not yet published)&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;";1996;6.42022;2.2468;2;4;60;10;Exploration;careful similar entdecker title don t confuse entdecker die neuen entdecker know entdecker explore new horizon different short entdecker scout trail lead native hut entdecker entdecker start blank represent unexplored sea tile draw place square tile place island develop pay place settlement basis scout island effort powerful discoverer complete island yield invest exploration island course establish strong presence implement die neuen entdecker entdecker explore new horizon small entdecker release base online available www playcatan de site oceania revamp new entdecker series title far m reich der jadegottin publish m reich der w stensohne publish m reich der d auml monen publish
201;The Rose King;"Originally published as Texas by db-Spiele.&#10;&#10;The battle between farmers and ranchers is fairly abstract. A single pawn travels on a square grid. Each player has a hand of cards face up. These each have a direction and a distance. The player can either draw a card and add it to his hand, or play a card. If he plays a card, then the pawn moves the appropriate distance to an empty square, and the player places one of his markers. Each player also has judge symbols that can each be used only once. The judge lets you move onto a previously placed opposition marker and reverse it. Players score points for each contiguous region equal to the square of the number of markers. If a player is not careful, such a move may be forced, as there is a maximum number of cards that a player may hold.&#10;&#10;Contains rules for playing with 4 (in two partnerships of two players).&#10;&#10;Later republished 1999 as Rosenk&ouml;nig by Kosmos, as part of the two-player game series. The republication also included a re-theming of the game. The setting changed from Texas to England, and the factions changed from farmers and ranchers to the factions of the Plantagenet family from the Wars of the Roses (1455-1485) - the Lancaster (red rose) and the York (white rose) factions in a similarly abstracted fashion.&#10;&#10;Rosenk&ouml;nig is part of the Kosmos two-player series.&#10;&#10;";1992;6.81552;1.9375;2;2;30;10;Abstract Strategy, Medieval;originally publish texas db spiele battle farmer rancher fairly abstract single pawn travel square grid hand card face direction distance draw card add hand card card pawn appropriate distance square place marker judge symbol judge let previously place opposition marker reverse contiguous region equal square number marker careful force maximum number card hold contain partnership later republish rosenk ouml nig kosmos series republication include setting change texas england faction change farmer rancher faction plantagenet family war rose lancaster red rise york white rise faction similarly abstract fashion rosenk ouml nig kosmos series
202;Targui;"Conquer and occupy the valuable desert grounds. And also keep your home village! By tactically moving groups of camels through the different desert grounds and by using its specialties you can rule the desert. -- from the rulebook&#10;&#10;Targui has a board made of large square tiles representing the different types of desert ground. These provide varying economic and strategic value, from 0-5, and with a salt mine in the center, random distribution (with a little tinkering) makes a varied map each game. Players have a village tile which they place on the outer edge, and start with some camels and money. Your turn simply consists of moving and buying camels, expanding your control of the land.&#10;&#10;Targui has very simple mechanisms, and is in effect a simple rolling war game with obvious tactics. But the random turn order creates a wonderful world of rapidly shifting alliances, with players making and breaking promises within moments. The winner is not the one with most money or camels, but with the most economic value under their control.&#10;&#10;The game plays nicely with 3 or 4 players. However, Targui is a long game. Eight rounds takes about three hours, so using the whole deck of 20 fortune cards makes for an over-long game.

206;Jalape-NO!;"Jalape-NO!, first released as Pepper, is a trick-taking game in which you want to dodge the spiciness to end up with the lowest score possible.&#10;&#10;The deck consists of 108 cards (102 number cards and 6 pepper cards), with cards being numbered 1-18 in six colors and with the 1s being peppers. Based on the player count, you use 4-6 colors of cards ranging from 1-9 to 1-18.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, you receive 12 cards in hand, and you must place any peppers on the table in front of you. The lead player in a trick plays any card from their hand or one of their peppers. Each other player must follow suit, if possible, except that you are not forced to play the matching pepper card, should you have it. (However, if you do have it, you cannot play a pepper of another color to this trick.) Whoever plays the highest card in the suit led wins the trick and leads the next trick. If you win a pepper in a trick, place it on the table in front of you; you can play this pepper on a future trick, whether to lead off the trick or to play it on a trick that's already in progress.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player has no cards in hand, the round ends. All players add any cards in hand to the cards in front of them, whether peppers or cards claimed in tricks. Each pepper you have is worth 2 points, and each card in the same suit as a pepper you have is worth 1 point.

208;Ex & Hopp;"A quick and simple card game for 2-6 milk-drinking players. Each player places a color card down as their marker and the matching sets of cards numbered 1-12 in those colors make up the deck. The deck is shuffled and players get 4 cards, the remainder goes down as a draw deck. There is a set of small tiles in red and black for negative or positive points (red are 4,4,5,5,6,6, black are 2,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,6,6,6). These are shuffled face down and 4 turned up to start 4 rows.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you can place a card against a row or try to swap a card with another player. If you want to swap, you simply offer a color for another color, mentioning no numbers. Swap with the player of your choice, but if nobody wants to swap, you've wasted your turn.&#10;&#10;When you play a card to a row, you draw back so you have 4 cards. When the row is full, determined by the number on the tile, the player with the highest total in the cards has to take the tile, be it positive or negative. Usually your choices are obvious, but sometimes it is worth assisting another player to take a row, rather than waste a good card for you on a low or negative tile. If a row is tied between players, the cards are discarded and the tile stays for more cards.&#10;&#10;The discard deck is shuffled over, taken tiles refreshed by new ones. The game ends when the tiles are all taken, deduct the negative from the positive to get your score.&#10;&#10;This game was re-themed and expanded on with Relikt.&#10;&#10;";1996;5.48116;1.1667;2;6;30;10;Card Game;quick simple card milk drinking place color card marker matching set card number color deck deck shuffle card remainder go draw deck set small tile red black negative positive red black shuffle face start row place card row try swap card want swap simply offer color color mention number swap want swap ve waste card row draw card row determined number tile high total card tile positive negative usually obvious worth assist row waste good card low negative tile row tie card discard tile stay card discard deck shuffle take tile refresh new one end tile take deduct negative positive expand relikt

All of the gang members are placed around an oblong table, with some of the places indicating certain benefits.  If a place has a picture of a business, then the player makes money until the mobster is killed or moved.  If the place has a gun, then he can use it to shoot a mobster across the table.  If a place has a knife, then he can use it to stab someone seated next to him.  Plus, some of the mobsters have the ability to kill others all the time by carrying their own knives and guns.

Each player or team starts the game with a set of brackets or tokens (depending on the version of the game), and the first player to rid herself of brackets wins.&#10;&#10;On a turn, all players are confronted with a trivia question, say, &quot;When did the first Star Wars arrive in theaters?&quot; Each player then uses one bracket to mark a particular year or series of years on her individual year chart. Once everyone has placed their answers, the questioner reveals the answer and everyone sees whether that year appears in the range they guessed. If so, they remove that bracket from the game; if not, they keep the bracket.

215;Tichu;"Tichu took much of its rules and mechanics from Zheng Fen. It is a partnership climbing card game, and the object of play is to rid yourself of your hand, preferably while scoring points in the process.&#10;&#10;The deck is a standard 52-card pack with four special cards added: dog, phoenix, dragon and Mah Jong (1). When it's your turn, you may either beat the current top card combination &mdash; single card, pair of cards, sequence of pairs, full house, etc. &mdash; or pass. If play passes all the way back to the player who laid the top cards, they win the trick, clears the cards, and can lead the next one. The card led determines the only combination of cards that can be played on that trick, so if a single card is led, then only single cards are played; if a straight of seven cards is led, then only straights of seven cards can be played, etc.&#10;&#10;The last player out in a round gives all the cards they won to the player who exited first, and the last player's unplayed cards are handed to the opposite team. Fives, tens and Kings are worth 5, 10 and 10 points, with each hand worth one hundred points without bonuses &mdash; but the bonuses are what drive the game. At the start of a round, each player can call &quot;Tichu&quot; prior to playing any card. This indicates that the player thinks they can empty their hand first this round; if they do so, their team scores 100 points, and if not, their team instead loses 100 points. Cards are dealt at the start of a round in a group of eight and a group of six; a player can call &quot;Grand Tichu&quot; after looking at only their first eight cards for a &plusmn;200 point bonus. If both players on a team exit a round prior to either player on the opposite team, then no points are scored for cards and the winning team earns 200 points (with Tichu/Grand Tichu bonuses and penalties being applied as normal).&#10;&#10;The first team to 1,000 points wins.&#10;&#10;";1991;7.57542;2.3385;4;4;60;10;Card Game;tichu take zheng fen partnership climbing card object rid hand preferably process deck standard card pack special card add dog phoenix dragon mah jong beat current card combination mdash single card pair card sequence pair house etc mdash pass pass way lay card trick clear card lead card lead determine combination card trick single card lead single card straight seven card lead straight seven card etc give card exit unplayed card hand opposite team five ten king worth hand worth bonus mdash bonus drive start tichu prior card indicate think hand team team instead card deal start group group grand tichu look card plusmn bonus team exit prior opposite team card team earn tichu grand tichu bonus penalty apply normal team

Royalists and Jacobins fight for superiority in the 25 city districts, which are represented by the game board. The two players alternately place one of their counters in order to control that space. When a player puts one of his number counters on the board, he projects influence onto the neighboring spaces in that row and column, and onto the space the counter itself is on. The amount of the influence corresponds to the number on the counter.

217;A la carte;"In one of his sillier games, Karl-Heinz Schmiel casts the players as semi-psychotic cooks attempting to hone their culinary skills. Each player receives a miniature pan and a hotplate. Then each turn you can either attempt to turn up the heat, season your dish, or attempt to steal another cook's recipe in the making. Heating your hotplate is a random affair with a die, and could raise the heat on everyone's plate. Spicing the dish is heart of the game and done by up-ending small bottles filled with little colored wood pellets. When the pellets tumble out of the bottle (sometimes, if they do), the number of pellets can't exceed two, because over-spicing the dish ruins it and you have to throw it in the trash!&#10;&#10;The 2009 version includes some changed rules, a new victory condition, additional recipes and some new mechanics in comparison to the 1989 version.&#10;&#10;";1989;6.45804;1.2932;2;4;30;8;Action / Dexterity;sillier karl heinz schmiel cast semi psychotic cook attempt hone culinary skill receive miniature pan hotplate attempt heat season dish attempt steal cook recipe making heat hotplate random affair die raise heat plate spice dish heart end small bottle fill little colored wood pellet pellet tumble bottle number pellet t exceed spice dish ruin throw trash include change new condition additional recipe new comparison
219;Volle HÃ¼tte;"Players take on the role of club-owners vying for customers' Deutsch Marks in this unique board game, called Full House in German.&#10;&#10;Each player is given a small board representing their cafe or pub. In your turn, you can either place a tile in your pub, representing different types of seating (bar, patio, formal) &amp; activities (dancing, shooting pool, playing fooseball), or you can select a customer card, to draw in customers to those specific tiles, if you have the seating available. A third choice is to take a Billing card, which gives you a tip in cash money, and makes all customers in all the players bars pay their bills too. Yellow customers are worth 10 DM, red 20 DM and blue customers pay 30 DM.&#10;&#10;When there are at least ten customers floating around, players can also spend a Action card which moves customers around. The cards either move off a specific tile type to a type you choose, or from a tile type you choose to a specific tile. So you might move customers specifically from the terrace seating to any other type of your choice (such as the disco floor), or from a tile of your choice (such as the bar) to specifically a Pool Table. The cards allow from 1-4 customers to move, depending on the tiles.&#10;&#10;This is the clever part. As the customers move, they normally pay their bill, unless the Action card shows a No Pay symbol, making them bill-dodgers. When customers move, they first look for a suitable spot within the same pub! Only if they can't find one (either it lacks that type of tile, or there isn't enough room to accommodate them), do they then start wandering clockwise to the next pub, and keep going until they find a suitable spot. If they can't, they leave the game.&#10;&#10;So if you have an Action card that pays a bill, and you have the right empty spaces in your bar (because you've carefully put in a variety of attractions), you move your customers around inside your bar and collect the money (&quot;Hey, we're paying our bar tab now, we're gonna shoot some Pool&quot;). If you have a suitable Action card with a No Pay symbol, you move customers from another player's bar into yours (&quot;This place stinks guys, let's skip out and find a Fooseball!&quot;). It is this clever management of customers that will net you big profits.&#10;&#10;And if your bar is pretty full, especially with blue and red customers, you call a billing as your first action. The other players also collect, but you should have a margin on them, plus the tip (from 30-70 DM).&#10;&#10;There are always three Customer cards and three Action cards face up, and two fresh tiles, so you should be able to make good choices and plan ahead a little. The game ends when the Action cards or the Billing cards are exhausted.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player with the most money, having milked the punters as much as possible.&#10;&#10;";1997;6.17446;2.0909;3;5;30;12;Economic;role club owner vie customer deutsch mark unique call house german give small represent cafe pub place tile pub represent different seat bar patio formal amp activity dance shoot pool fooseball select customer card draw customer specific tile seating available billing card give tip cash money make customer bar pay bill yellow customer worth dm red dm blue customer pay dm customer float spend action card customer card specific tile choose tile choose specific tile customer specifically terrace seating disco floor tile bar specifically pool table card allow customer depend tile clever customer normally pay bill action card show pay symbol make bill dodger customer look suitable spot pub t find lack tile isn t room accommodate start wander clockwise pub go find suitable spot t leave action card pay bill right space bar ve carefully variety attraction customer inside bar collect money hey pay bar tab go to shoot pool suitable action card pay symbol customer bar place stink guy let skip find fooseball clever management customer net big profit bar pretty especially blue red customer billing action collect margin plus tip dm customer card action card face fresh tile able good plan ahead little end action card billing card exhaust winner money having milk punter possible
221;Ikusa;"Shogun / Samurai Swords is the last game in the original Milton Bradley Gamemaster series. It was later rereleased by HAH under the name Ikusa. The game focuses on the chaotic feudal society of Japan during the Middle Ages. Players play one of several factions that erupt into a civil war, trying to consolidate their strongholds and then defeat other armies for the right to be called Shogun, the supreme ruler.&#10;&#10;In the game, players command forces on islands of feudal Japan.  Player forces include provincial forces in the provinces and mobile armies commanded by daimyos.  In each turn, players will allocate their koku into bids and purchases for the round.  The round begins with the allocation of turn order, which is determined by bid, and in the case of tied bids, by player agreement or random draw.  Then players other bids and payments are accounted for in purchases of castles and fortresses, drafting of new troops and ronin, and a bid for the lone ninja.  Following the bids phase, players in turn order plan and execute attacks against enemy territories, with attacks resolved through die rolls.  A player wins the game when he or she has captured a certain number of territories, either via straight conquest or by vanquishing the last of an opponent's diamyos and taking over that player's forces.&#10;&#10;The game was originally published as Shogun and was later changed to Samurai Swords due to a name conflict with James Clavell&#039;s Shogun. Ikusa is the latest iteration of the game.&#10;&#10;Winner of 1988 Origins Awards:&#10;&#10;     Best Pre-20th Century Board Game&#10;     Best Graphic Presentation of a Board Game&#10;&#10;&#10;";1986;7.02952;2.9544;2;5;360;12;Civil War, Medieval, Territory Building, Wargame;shogun samurai sword original milton bradley gamemaster series later rerelease hah ikusa focus chaotic feudal society japan middle age faction erupt civil war try consolidate stronghold defeat army right call shogun supreme ruler command force island feudal japan force include provincial force province mobile army command daimyos allocate koku bid purchase begin allocation order determine bid case tie bid agreement random draw bid payment account purchase castle fortress draft new troop ronin bid lone ninja follow bid order plan execute attack enemy territory attack resolve die capture certain number territory straight conquest vanquish opponent diamyos take force originally publish shogun later change samurai sword conflict james clavell shogun ikusa late iteration winner origin award well pre th century good graphic presentation
222;Space Beans;"This game is a successor to the popular Bohnanza but is less complex and is not based on trading.&#10;&#10;Players attempt to collect 30 points in &quot;trophies&quot; to win the game. This is accomplished by working with up to two collections of space beans - 1 public (face-up) and 1 secret (face-down).&#10;&#10;The primary mechanic is drawing beans, placing them in one of your collections (public or secret) if you have any matching cards to play, then passing your entire hand to the player on your right. If you compile a collection that contains a number of beans equal to the number value on one of beans in the collection, you may redeem the collection for the same amount of points on that card.&#10;&#10;For example: If a player has three violet beans, and one of them has a value of 3, that collection can be converted for three trophy points. The card numbered 3 would go into the trophy pile, and the other cards into the discard pile.&#10;&#10;Space Beans is part of the Bohnanza family of games.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.08904;1.3833;2;6;40;10;Card Game, Science Fiction;successor popular bohnanza complex base trading attempt collect trophy accomplish work space bean public face secret face primary draw bean place public secret matching card pass entire hand right compile contain number bean equal number value bean redeem card example violet bean value convert trophy card number trophy pile card discard pile space bean bohnanza family
223;Expeditions: Around the World;"Based on Wolfgang Kramer's earlier effort Wildlife Adventure, Expedition &mdash; which is on the market as Expeditions: Around the World since 2023 &mdash; is a game about moving three commonly held expeditions around the world in search of various archaeological sites. The board shows a map of the world with many different branching paths, and players advance the expeditions by placing plastic arrows. When an expedition arrives at a location that matches one of your private site cards or one of the public site cards, you score that card. Certain spaces on the board allow you to play again immediately, and other spaces allow you to pick up a bonus action card that you can play at any time on one of your turns.&#10;&#10;The game ends when someone has scored all of their cards, then whoever has the highest total score wins.&#10;&#10;";1996;6.73042;1.9771;2;6;45;8;Adventure, Educational, Exploration, Transportation, Travel;base wolfgang kramer early effort wildlife adventure expedition mdash market expedition world mdash commonly hold expedition world search archaeological site show map world different branching path advance expedition place plastic arrow expedition arrive location match private site card public site card card certain space allow immediately space allow pick bonus action card time end card high total
224;History of the World;"History of the World works under the assumptions that all empires eventually fade and that the only things differentiating great empires from lesser ones is how much territory they conquer and how long it takes for their civilizations to disappear.  The game is played out over 7 epochs or rounds, from the ancient 3000 B.C. Sumerians to the pre-WW1 Germany, with every player controlling a new rising empire from history.  Some empires are stronger than others (like the Romans), but the game's clever mechanisms can help balance that out.  At the end of each epoch, players score points for all units of their color (from both the current and any previous empires) remaining on the board.&#10;&#10;Before the start of their turn a player may play up to two Event cards from their hand.  The Events played are resolved before the player starts his Empire's actions.  If the player's active Empire has navigation a ship token is placed in each sea or ocean listed (if an ocean is listed all adjacent seas to the ocean have ship markers put into them).  A Reallocation Greater Event allows an Empire with Navigation to exchange Fleets in seas and oceans for Coins that can be used to buy back defeated troops (1 coin per troop).  If the active Empire has a capitol it is taken and placed in the Empire's starting land with one unit of the Empire's available troops.  Since each land space may only contain one troop the player begins expanding from their starting land by placing troops in any adjacent land space that they wish to occupy or conquer.  To conquer a land the attacker moves one unit into the land space either from adjacent land or through a sea with a ship in it.  Then dice are rolled, the attacker gets 2 dice and the defender only one, unless the attacker traveled across a strait or the defender's land has either a forest, the great wall of China, or mountains on the border of the land that the attacker came from.  In this case the defender receives 2 dice as well.  If the attack comes from the sea the defender gets 3 dice for defense.  Highest score wins with ties killing off both the defender and attacker.  In this case the attacker can merely place the next troop, if he has any left, in the now-empty land space.&#10;&#10;At any time the active Empire player may exchange an unplaced troop for a fort.  On later turns, a fort gives the player a +1 to defensive rolls in that land.  Also, if the defender in a fort loses or ties with an attacker only the fort is removed and the battle continues.  Whenever an army conquers a land with a capitol the capitol mini is flipped reducing it to a city (if it was a city to begin with it is removed from board when conquered).  After the active player's Empire is finished with it's actions check to see if it conquered to land spaces with resource symbols, if so it can build a monument.&#10;&#10;Then scoring takes place.  Each area (Middle-East, Northern Europe, Eurasia, etc...) has a tile with 3 values for the current Epoch.  One value is for having a presence in the area (at least one land).  Another value is for having Dominance in the area (at least 2 lands and more than any other player in area). The last value is for having Control of an area (at least 3 lands and no other player has any in area).  These values vary from Epoch to Epoch and Area to Area (Middle-East is more valuable in early Epochs and fades in later Epochs, for example).  Total the scores from each area for all pieces of the player's color from all Empires controlled that remain on board.  Then add 2 points for each capitol controlled, 1 point per city and one point for each monument controlled. After all areas are scored the next Empire called takes its turn.&#10;&#10;After all players have taken their turns and scored, for the first Epoch, the player with the highest score gets to take a pre-eminence marker and places it in front of him.  These are secret bonus points (worth somewhere from 3 to 6) for the end of the game and may not be examined till then.  This bonus to leader helps balance the Empire-draw mechanic and makes it valuable to score maximal points even early in the game, rather than tanking to get a better draw later. Then drawing begins for the next Epoch with the player having the lowest score drawing first on up to the person with the highest score drawing last (and likely being given a less than optimal Empire by another player).&#10;&#10;After the last player has scored for Epoch 7 and the leader has drawn a pre-eminence marker, all players reveal their pre-eminence markers and add them to their scores.  The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;";1991;7.11455;2.766;3;6;270;12;Civilization, Ancient, Medieval, Napoleonic, Post-Napoleonic, Renaissance, Wargame, World War I;history world work assumption empire eventually fade thing differentiate great empire less one territory conquer long take civilization disappear epoch ancient b c sumerian pre ww germany new rise empire history empire strong like romans clever mechanism help balance end epoch unit color current previous empire remain start event card hand event resolve start empire action active empire navigation ship token place sea ocean list ocean list adjacent sea ocean ship marker reallocation great event allow empire navigation exchange fleet sea ocean coin buy defeat troop coin troop active empire capitol take place empire start land unit empire available troop land space contain troop begin expand start land place troop adjacent land space wish occupy conquer conquer land attacker unit land space adjacent land sea ship dice attacker get dice defender attacker travel strait defender land forest great wall china mountain border land attacker come case defender receive dice attack come sea defender get dice defense high tie kill defender attacker case attacker merely place troop left land space time active empire exchange unplaced troop fort later fort give defensive land defender fort tie attacker fort remove battle continue army conquer land capitol capitol mini reduce city city begin remove conquer active empire finish action check conquer land space resource symbol build monument take place area middle east northern europe eurasia etc tile value current epoch value have presence area land value have dominance area land area value have area land area value vary epoch epoch area area middle east valuable early epoch fade later epoch example total area piece color empire remain add capitol city monument area empire call take take epoch high get pre eminence marker place secret bonus worth end examine till bonus leader help balance empire draw make valuable maximal early tank well draw later draw begin epoch have low drawing person high drawing likely give optimal empire epoch leader draw pre eminence marker reveal pre eminence marker add high
225;Icehouse;"This is the game that introduced Icehouse Pieces. In December 1989, an initial test run of 100 Icehouse sets were made and sold, packaged in black boxes. Later, a few more of these handmade sets were produced, but in very limited quantities.&#10;&#10;This game doesn't use turns, or rounds, or anything else to break up the action.  Players place their pieces as quickly or slowly as they like, in attacking or defending positions.  Only when time runs out or when everyone has used up all their pieces is the game scored, with people getting points for their safe defenders and successful attackers.&#10;&#10;Stashes of Icehouse Pieces without rules, later released as Looney Pyramids, have an accessory entry here: Looney Pyramids.&#10;&#10;";1989;6.62816;2.5957;3;5;20;8;Abstract Strategy, Real-time;introduce icehouse piece december initial test run icehouse set sell package black box later handmade set produce limited quantity doesn t use break action place piece quickly slowly like attack defend position time run piece people get safe defender successful attacker stash icehouse piece later release looney pyramid accessory entry looney pyramid
226;Isi;"Isi is a colorful abstract strategy game played on two levels.  On a basic level, each player is moving a pawn around the island of Isi, picking up tokens - there's a little strategy here, because which tokens you pick up are important, and one player's pawn can interfere with the other's.  But on another level, players are spending those tokens to build 'trade routes' between cities on the same island.  Cities grow as they become connected by trade routes, and at the end of the game whichever city's grown the most becomes the capital city; whoever is connected the most to the capital wins the game.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Morisi&#10;&#10;&#10;";1999;6.58333;0.0;2;2;30;12;Abstract Strategy;isi colorful abstract strategy basic pawn island isi pick token little strategy token pick important pawn interfere spend token build trade route city island city grow connect trade route end whichever city grow capital city connect capital implement morisi

230;Merchant of Venus;"Merchant of Venus makes players take on the roles of space traders chasing wealth and fortune. Each player moves their ship through interconnected systems on a fixed map, discovering new alien worlds to trade with. As players start to make money delivering commodities, their earnings can be used to purchase equipment and construct their own infrastructure. The player who first acquires enough total value in cash and port/factory deeds wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game uses a basic roll-and-move mechanism for movement, but modifies it with engine ship upgrades that let the players skip certain spaces during movement. When players reach cities and spaceports, they can buy and sell commodities. Different species are randomly distributed throughout the universe at the start of the game, and players will only uncover which species lives where through exploration in the course of the game - the layout of which species lives where works to offset the rigidity of the fixed map by making different routes through the map profitable each game.&#10;&#10;The prices a player receives for selling their cargo is determined by the species that lives in the system, and what commodities a port offers for purchase is determined by a unique and dynamic supply-and-demand mechanism. With their money, players can replace their spaceships with better models, or build factories (which create better commodities) and spaceports (which speed up trading). They can also buy upgrades for their ships (like shields, lasers, or engines).&#10;&#10;Variations included in the rulebook allow for interplayer combat and solo play, and the exact target wealth players have to acquire in order to win is decided on before each play.&#10;&#10;";1988;7.13279;2.8327;1;6;180;12;Economic, Exploration, Science Fiction, Space Exploration, Transportation;merchant venus make role space trader chase wealth fortune ship interconnect fix map discover new alien world trade start money deliver commodity earning purchase equipment construct infrastructure acquire total value cash port factory deed use basic mechanism modify engine ship upgrade let skip certain space reach city spaceport buy sell commodity different specie randomly distribute universe start uncover specie live exploration course layout specie live work offset rigidity fix map make different route map profitable price receive sell cargo determine specie live commodity port offer purchase determine unique dynamic supply demand mechanism money replace spaceship well model build factory create well commodity spaceport speed trading buy upgrade ship like shield laser engine variation include rulebook allow interplayer combat solo exact target wealth acquire order decide
231;Geronimo;"The U.S. - Indian conflicts, a tragic period of history.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players are randomly assigned a side to play -- either Indian tribes or the U.S. Only one player represents the U.S. each turn, while the other players each have a number of Indian tribes under their control. Indian players get to select one or two of their active tribes, but the rest are dealt to them randomly. There are usually more Indian tribes available than what are active each turn, but players don't really know which ones are inactive.  This can be unsettling to the U.S. player as he must decide where to deploy his limited troops and columns.&#10;&#10;All players compete to earn victory points.  The U.S. player is faced with the task of building up sufficient resources (settlements, towns, railroads, mines, etc.) to maintain existing states and convert territories into states. The Indian players play the role of guerrillas to earn victory points, but also can deny resources to the U.S. player. However, he must be very careful not to suffer too many casualties, as this could cause his tribe to go on reservation or become extinct, which costs the player dearly in victory points.&#10;&#10;";1995;5.75161;3.1935;1;5;480;12;American Indian Wars, American West, Wargame;u indian conflict tragic period history randomly assign indian tribe u represent u number indian tribe indian select active tribe rest deal randomly usually indian tribe available active don t know one inactive unsettling u decide deploy limited troop column compete earn u face task build sufficient resource settlement town railroad mine etc maintain exist state convert territory state indian role guerrilla earn deny resource u careful suffer casualty cause tribe reservation extinct cost dearly
232;Serenissima;"The Theme&#10;&#10;In the fourteenth century, the Atlantic was an ocean without end and America was yet to be discovered. The Mediterranean was a sea of great prosperity - the only route between East and West. The greatest fleets of the age battled for the most lucrative trade routes.&#10;&#10;Trade cities like Venice, Genoa, Barcelona or Istanbul grew as powerful as whole nations, establishing trade routes as far as North Africa or Middle East, bringing back Spice, Gems or Gold to the western Mediterranean. SERENISSIMA recreates this era, when the Mediterranean was at the centre of world trade.&#10;&#10;The Game&#10;&#10;Each players assume the role of one of those four city-states. Their goal is to establish their sphere of influence in the Mediterranean, and share all sorts of commodities to make their trading empire the most prosperous. In the course of a game, players must build galleys, hire crew and buy/sell commodities. The value of goods can be influenced by players having monopolies in certain commodities. Players can also take control of ports, thereby earning extra income from players using the port, as well as being able to get this port's specific commodity.&#10;&#10;In the end, the scoring is based on the number of ports each player control, but also on the fact that those ports have commodities of different kind available. Ports come in three types : small, medium, and city-states. Whereas small ports are quite easy to satisfy (they need only two commodities to be considered &quot;full&quot;), the four starting city-states are far more difficult to please, as they will need all kind of commodities available (6 additional commodities, plus the one they produce).&#10;&#10;During the course of the game, the number and type of commodities available in ports also controls the number of crew members you can hire, if you can build galleys or forts, and the price of commodities when you sell them. For example, a player won't be able to build new galleys until they have wood and iron available in one of the ports they control. Once a galley has been built, it has 5 spaces available, that can be filled by the crew or the goods. Every crew member allows movement through one space, and makes the galley more powerful. But those spaces are also needed to carry the goods that are worth money. Money that can be used to hire new crews, build new galleys, or commodities. A balance thus needs to be struck between trading commodities and taking control of ports - between a fleet of merchant galleys and a fleet of warships.&#10;&#10;The game lasts between 5 to 8 turns depending on the number of active players. Turn order is defined by bidding. The winner of the bid choose whether he will play first, second, third or last. Depending on the situation and what the player wants to do, playing first or last might be equally interesting. For example, by playing first, a player would be unable to react to other players move, but he could avoid having his galleys blockaded.&#10;&#10;";1996;6.85083;3.0347;2;4;120;12;Economic, Nautical, Renaissance;fourteenth century atlantic ocean end america discover mediterranean sea great prosperity route east west great fleet age battle lucrative trade route trade city like venice genoa barcelona istanbul grow powerful nation establish trade route far north africa middle east bring spice gem gold western mediterranean serenissima recreate era mediterranean centre world trade assume role city state establish sphere influence mediterranean share sort commodity trading empire prosperous course build galley hire crew buy sell commodity value good influence have monopoly certain commodity port earn extra income port able port specific commodity end base number port fact port commodity different kind available port come small medium city state small port easy satisfy need commodity consider start city state far difficult need kind commodity available additional commodity plus produce course number commodity available port number crew member hire build galley fort price commodity sell example t able build new galley wood iron available port galley build space available fill crew good crew member allow space make galley powerful space need carry good worth money money hire new crew build new galley commodity balance need strike trading commodity take port fleet merchant galley fleet warship last depend number active order define bid winner bid choose second depend situation want equally interesting example unable react avoid have galley blockade

It presents a conflict between two super-powers of Antiquity from classical Clausewitzian perspective, according to which a power only reverts to military operations when there is no other way to achieve the goal: political dominance.&#10;&#10;Players use Strategy Cards for multiple purposes: moving generals, levying new troops, reinforcing existing armies, gaining political control of the provinces involved in the war, and introducing historical events.

235;Blackbeard;"Introduction (from the rule book):&#10;&#10;BLACKBEARD recreates &quot;The Golden Age of Piracy&quot; at the turn of the 18th century. Each player becomes one or more pirates and attempts to amass a fortune and retire before a King's Commissioner tracks him down, a Warship stumbles across him, or his own crew cuts his throat! Merchant ships plying the trade routes are the targets. Prizes range from near-worthless supplies to the fabulous Spanish and Mogul treasure ships. Luck, skill and cunning all play a part as you comb the Seven Seas (well ... at least three of them) for fame and fortune. Players should be aware that the game simulates 18th century piracy and therefore features random happenstance. Little can be planned. Players who are ready to strike when opportunity presents itself and are wily and aggressive without being rash will fare best in the long run.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players take up the roles of famous pirates navigating the major sea lanes during the golden age of piracy.  Plunder and pirateering await as each player moves about on the map in a variable system through a deck of cards.  Rather than the normal turn order in games, players move when their designation is drawn in a deck.  When not in the role of their pirate they can take on the role of one of the English military ships hunting the sea for pirates.

240;Britannia;"&quot;Britannia&quot; is a historical Strategic board-wargame that broadly depicts the millennia-long struggle for control of England, Scotland, and Wales. The game begins with the Roman invasion of 43 A.D., continues through the many struggles between Angles, Saxons, Picts, Norsemen, Scots, Irish, and other tribes, and ends with the Norman invasion of 1066.&#10;&#10;Britannia allows players to re-create this epic history, re-enacting important battles in some cases, altering the course of history in others. The game rules discourage players from making historically unrealistic moves, but also give players the freedom to alter Great Britain&rsquo;s history in important ways, creating countless interesting &ldquo;what if?&rdquo; scenarios. What if Boudicca&rsquo;s Revolt against the Romans had been more successful? What if the Romans and the Romano-British had repelled the Saxon invasions of the 5th and 6th centuries?

242;Junta;"Players represent various families in Republica de los Bananas. Each game turn has between 7 and 9 rounds, drawing cards, President assigns roles, foreign aid money is drawn, the president proposes a budget which is voted on, locations are chosen, there are assassination attempts, then the bank may be open or not, there may be a coup and aftermath, then the next round starts. The game is won by whoever has the most pesos in their Swiss bank account when the money runs out.&#10;&#10;The game is for 4 to 7 players (although there are 2 and 3 player variants).  A president for life (El Presidente) is elected and then she or he allocates roles for all other players.  Depending upon his or her office and the various cards they hold, each player has a certain number of votes. These are important for the first vote to elect El Presidente and then there are votes each turn on the budget proposed by the President. The budget starts when the President draws 8 money cards face down from the money deck (which varies in denomination from $1 to $3) and proposes allocations. Not everyone will be included in the budget and the amounts are at the President's discretion. The President can keep undisclosed foreign aid money.&#10;&#10;Players may attempt to assassinate the other players including the President by guessing where they will be from among five locations. Players who successfully assassinate another player take that player's unbanked money, the only safe money is the money that has been deposited in a players' Swiss bank account, and the only way to get to the bank is to survive the assassination round. Players assassinated or killed simply become another member of their family and begin again with new cards, but keeping any of their family's funds deposited in their Swiss bank account.&#10;&#10;If players are unhappy, see an advantage, or just want to, and there is a 'coup excuse', they can start a coup. A coup sees players compete using armed forces to control a majority of the 5 power centers. Rebel players control the forces of the role which they were assigned prior to the coup  (e.g. army, navy, air force), and players loyal to the President do the same, seeking to control the strongholds until the coup is over. At the conclusion of each coup players who have control of the 5 power centres vote to be pro-President or pro-Junta determining if the President stays, or the Junta wins and elects a new President. And someone is sent to the firing squad.&#10;&#10;";1979;6.68805;2.858;2;7;240;16;Economic, Humor, Negotiation, Political;represent family republica de los bananas drawing card president assign role foreign aid money draw president propose budget vote location choose assassination attempt bank open coup aftermath start peso swiss bank account money run president life el presidente elect allocate role depend office card hold certain number vote important vote elect el presidente vote budget propose president budget start president draw money card face money deck vary denomination propose allocation include budget amount president discretion president undisclosed foreign aid money attempt assassinate include president guess location successfully assassinate unbanked money safe money money deposit swiss bank account way bank survive assassination assassinate kill simply member family begin new card keep family fund deposit swiss bank account unhappy advantage want coup excuse start coup coup see compete armed force majority power center rebel force role assign prior coup e g army navy air force loyal president seeking stronghold coup conclusion coup power centre vote pro president pro junta determine president stay junta elect new president send firing squad

In the Chariot Race game you pick your team of horses, driver, and chariot car, each of which have special characteristics . . . In Gladiator, you pick up your weapons and step onto the bloodstained sands, simultaneously maneuvering, striking, and waiting for that fatal step that puts you inside your opponent's guard.&quot;&#10;&#10;Battleline&#039;s Circus Maximus would later be developed by Don Greenwood and published in 1980 by The Avalon Hill Game Co as separate titles: Circus Maximus and Gladiator.&#10;&#10;Violent and bloody, Circus Maximus details the chariot races that occurred in ancient Rome.  Eight teams race around the track three times to determine victory.  Players prepare for the race by selecting the composition of their team of horses, their rider's skills, and the type of chariot that will be driven.  Once the race begins the players are free to do as they wish to hamper the other racers including whipping the rider, ramming chariots with scythed wheels, smashing into horses, and running over crashed opponents.  A campaign game of multiple races, in which players have to manage their teams and can increase their income by betting on races, is also possible.&#10;&#10;";1979;6.77623;2.6205;2;10;120;12;Ancient, Fighting, Racing;battleline original publisher grandeur decadence ancient rome living room thrill dust chariot race skillful bloodshed gladiatorial combat circus maximus chariot race pick team horse driver chariot car special characteristic gladiator pick weapon step bloodstaine sand simultaneously maneuver strike wait fatal step put inside opponent guard battleline circus maximus later develop don greenwood publish avalon hill co separate title circus maximus gladiator violent bloody circus maximus detail chariot race occur ancient rome team race track time determine prepare race select composition team horse rider skill chariot drive race begin free wish hamper racer include whip rider ram chariot scythe wheel smash horse run crash opponent campaign multiple race manage team increase income bet race possible

249;Lifeboats;"Also known as 'Rette Sich Wer Kann' ('Each Man for Himself') and often times referred to as 'The Lifeboat Game,' this pure negotiation game puts a different spin on the typical ocean catastrophe.  There's been a boating accident, and a rag-tag group of six lifeboats is trying to make its way to one of several islands just over the horizon.  However only one boat will make any forward progress in a given turn, so players try to convince everyone to vote for his particular favorite.  To further complicate matters, the sailors can't seem to decide which boat they want to be in, so they're constantly jumping out of boats to swim to another one.  As if all that wasn't enough, one of the boats springs a leak each turn.  If the boat is at maximum occupancy when the leak occurs, then players vote to decide who to toss to the sharks!&#10;&#10;";1993;6.58034;1.7821;3;6;90;12;Nautical, Negotiation, Party Game;know rette sich wer kann man time refer lifeboat pure negotiation put different spin typical ocean catastrophe boat accident rag tag group lifeboat try way island horizon boat forward progress give try convince vote particular favorite complicate matter sailor t decide boat want constantly jump boat swim wasn t boat spring leak boat maximum occupancy leak occur vote decide toss shark

255;Jena-Auerstadt: The Battle for Prussia, 14 October 1806;"Extrapolated from a short review written by Francois Charton for the SPI Compendium&#10;&#10;A small mini-game picturing the twin battles of October 1806, about 100 counters (a little less in fact), one half regular size map, representing the two battlefields, connected by a series of off-map movement boxes. Game takes about 10 minutes to learn and 1-2 hours to play, high solitaire playability.  The rules are as simple as possible. Units have Zones of control, which cannot be exited. When in enemy ZOC, combat is mandatory. Units may advance after combat. Retreats through ZOCs are forbidden, so you need to surround the enemy to eliminate him. Artillery may fire two hexes away (and not suffer from adverse results). Cavalry units are just faster and weaker infantry units .  There are two scenarios.  The historical one pictures Napoleon in Jena, outnumbering the Prussians, and Davout in Auerstadt, outnumbered by other Prussians. ). To win, you have to eliminate as many enemy units as possible at the end of the game (thus demoralizing the enemy).  The second &quot;what-if&quot; scenario assumes that all the Prussians have been sent to Jena, for the decisive battle. Davout will enter as reinforcement, on the flank/back of the Prussians, but in the end of the game.  Play balance to be pretty good, perhaps slightly favoring  the French.&#10;&#10;One on four games included in the Napoleon At War QuadriGame.

259;Atlantic Storm;"In this unique take on the trick-taking genre, cards represent the units that attacked or defended Allied convoys in the North Atlantic throughout World War II.&#10;&#10;For each trick, the lead player selects a convoy that traversed either the Arctic or the Atlantic in a given year (1940-1943), then declares whether the battle will be fought in the air, on the surface of the ocean, or under the sea.  He follows that up by playing a unit, either German or Allied, that was available in the chosen year and could fight in the chosen environment, and the other players subsequently either pass or play a unit (of either nationality) that meets the same conditions.  When all players have made their selections, dice (sometimes) are rolled and totals are compared to determine whether the Germans or the Allies won.  The player who contributed the most to the winning team gets to decide how the convoy and the opposing enemy ships, which are all worth victory points and possibly an increased hand size, are to be distributed amongst the players who were on the winning side.

261;Olympia 2000 (v. Chr.);"In this relative of Hols der Geier/Raj, players use simultaneously played cards to compete in ancient Olympic events, such as long-jump, discus, or archery.  The cards have a picture of the athlete as well as a rating for his skills in each of the different events.  Often times, an athlete will be very good at one event and be very poor in others, while some athletes are simply too inept for words, and still others are god-like.  The key to the game is using your cards wisely, because although the best athlete gets the prize for the current event, the worst athlete gets to pick the up-coming event.&#10;&#10;";1994;6.05641;1.3846;2;5;30;9;Ancient, Card Game, Sports;relative hol der gei raj use simultaneously card compete ancient olympic event long jump discus archery card picture athlete rating skill different event time athlete good event poor athlete simply inept word god like key card wisely good athlete get prize current event bad athlete get pick come event

265;Intrigue;"This pure negotiation game pits the players as Renaissance era families that are engaging in rampant nepotism.  Players are seeking positions in the other families' businesses, and to further that pursuit players offer bribes.  However, once accepting a bribe, the 'bought' player is under absolutely no obligation to honor the highest briber or any other verbal deal.  In a word, this game is vicious.&#10;&#10;The new AMIGO edition came out in 2005.&#10;&#10;The main difference between the F.X. Schmid and the AMIGO versions are that the the F.X. Schmid version uses five houses/buildings per player, with values of 1,2,3,5, and 10, but the AMIGO version uses four buildings/houses per player, with values of 1,3,6, and 10.  Accordingly, the F.X. Schmid version has five professions - knight, merchant, lawyer, writer, and clergy - but the AMIGO version retains only clergy and writer, and adds chemist and doctor.&#10;&#10;";1994;6.38083;1.9241;3;5;45;14;Negotiation, Renaissance;pure negotiation pit renaissance era family engage rampant nepotism seek position family business pursuit offer bribe accept bribe buy absolutely obligation honor high briber verbal deal word vicious new amigo come main difference f x schmid amigo f x schmid use house building value amigo use building house value accordingly f x schmid profession knight merchant lawyer writer clergy amigo retain clergy writer add chemist doctor
267;Tycoon;"In Tycoon, players are businessmen traveling around the world, doing what businessmen do: making money.  In this case, business is defined as opening hotels and factories in major cities, like Sydney, Cairo, and New York.&#10;&#10;Players are seeking to build hotels in as many cities as possible while also building the first or second most hotels in given cites to earn money, which is also your score. Additional money can be earned by building factories in each city, but these are limited in number.&#10;&#10;During the course of the game players will take turns buying and/or using plane tickets to move about the board's nine cities. A number of tickets are displayed in rows, divided into two types: The more expensive scheduled flights which allow you to move directly to the printed city, or move your token a number of city spaces orthogonally on the board. Cheaper charter flights allow movement directly between the two city spaces printed on the ticket. You may buy tickets at any time during your turn, and you are not required to move but must do so before taking any regular actions; you may also use any many tickets in a turn as you wish.&#10;&#10;The regular actions include building hotels and factories. Hotels are built on a u-shaped track. When a hotel is built on a red space the building that is oldest/furthest back on the track is removed. Players with the first and second most hotels on the track will be the only ones to score, with ties broken by the player with the earliest bulding on the track. There are only two factory spaces per city, and they will score points equal to the second place of the hotel scoring. In lieu of any actions or flying, or if you simply have no money, you may also take out loans; this removes your token from the board and forces you to use the more costly scheduled flights to return to the board.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game players are given all of their factories. Each round players are given a set number of hotels in addition to any they have left over from the previous round. When any player has built all of the hotels in front of them a scoring occurs. After three scorings the game ends and the player with the most money is the winner.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.75611;2.6375;2;4;90;10;Economic;tycoon businessman travel world businessman make money case business define opening hotel factory major city like sydney cairo new york seek build hotel city possible build second hotel give cite earn money additional money earn build factory city limit number course buy plane ticket city number ticket display row divide expensive schedule flight allow directly print city token number city space orthogonally cheap charter flight allow directly city space print ticket buy ticket time require take regular action use ticket wish regular action include build hotel factory hotel build u shape track hotel build red space building oldest furth track remove second hotel track one tie break early bulding track factory space city equal second place hotel lieu action flying simply money loan remove token force use costly schedule flight return start give factory give set number hotel addition leave previous build hotel occur end money winner

Each player represent one of five noble families attempting to build status for their family. Status is achieved by accumulating fiefs, money, history cards in sets (which include such things as Queens, scientists, cultural personalities, palaces, commanders, etc.), troops and merchants.&#10;&#10;The game is driven by event cards ... and there are a ton of 'em. On a turn, a player draws an event card and can play as many of them as he sees fit (whether during his turn or not). Thus, the game becomes a series of various events, usually aiding the player and/or hurting his opponents in some fashion.&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Svea Rike: Batalj&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Note:&#10;The game was first published by Casper in 1996, and after their demise by Anv&#195;&#164;ndbart Litet F&#195;&#182;retag (ALF) in the early 2000s.&#10;&#10;";1996;6.39677;2.4419;2;5;120;12;Civilization, Economic;user review create history sweden reign gustav vasa karl xiii represent noble family attempt build status family status achieve accumulate fief money history card set include thing queen scientist cultural personality palace commander etc troop merchant drive event card ton em draw event card see fit series event usually aid hurt opponent fashion expand svea rike batalj note publish casper demise anv ndbart litet f retag alf early

274;Guerilla;"Guerilla is a multi-player simulation card-wargame. Three to six players vie for control of the government as rebels wage a civil war against those in power. As in real guerrilla warfare, the government forces are handicapped by their inability to separate friend from foe. This &quot;fog of war&quot; is accomplished by a clever dichotomy of goals wherein each player simultaneously commands both government and rebel forces. However, each player is secretly backing either the government of rebel cause and is severely penalized if his &quot;side&quot; doesn't win the hand.&#10;&#10;Consequently, players are always torn between scoring for their &quot;side&quot;, or for themselves, or even sacrificing their own resources for the sake of an opponent who appears to be on their side. But is he? Even when you think you've figured out who is who, the Revolution card can appear to change loyalties and totally cloud the issue again.&#10;&#10;Players score by eliminating opposing forces, manipulating the media and world opinion, or controlling various installations such as the Port or Airfield which grant special abilities to those who hold them. Government air power and armor columns struggle against ambushing guerrilla bands which fade back into the jungle without a trace. If atrocities are committed, the U.N. may intervene and attempt to stop the open warfare. Then the battle is fought by secret police who ferret out traitors while propaganda battles are waged for the hearts and minds of the populace. Assassins abound as influential leaders are targeted in an attempt to paralyze opposing troops in preparation for the day when the U.N. withdraws.&#10;&#10;Game length is variable and selected at outset. A game can comprise a single hand or be combined into three or more - resulting in a game from one to four hours in duration.&#10;&#10;";1994;6.26961;2.641;3;6;120;12;Card Game, Civil War, Modern Warfare, Political, Wargame;guerilla multi simulation card wargame vie government rebel wage civil war power real guerrilla warfare government force handicap inability separate friend foe fog war accomplish clever dichotomy simultaneously command government rebel force secretly back government rebel cause severely penalize doesn t hand consequently tear sacrifice resource sake opponent appear think ve figure revolution card appear change loyalty totally cloud issue eliminate oppose force manipulate medium world opinion installation port airfield grant special hold government air power armor column struggle ambush guerrilla band fade jungle trace atrocity commit u n intervene attempt stop open warfare battle fight secret police ferret traitor propaganda battle wage heart mind populace assassin abound influential leader target attempt paralyze oppose troop preparation day u n withdraws length variable select outset comprise single hand combine result hour duration
275;Extinction;"&quot;The Last Game They Ever Played&quot;&#10;&#10;Extinction is a card game for 2-6 players, Ages 12 and up. The object of the game is to create large herds of dinosaurs while making your opponent's dino herds extinct.&#10;&#10;The game is played over 3 rounds, representing the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods. During each round, players can meld herds of herbivorous dinos to earn points at the end of the round, play egg cards in hopes of adding to an established herd later in the game. There are several calamity cards that can be drawn, or played by another player, to throw a wrench into a player's plans. Some of these include meat-eating dinosaurs, egg-eating cards and gene pool disasters.&#10;&#10;The larger your herds, and the more herds featuring different types of dinos, the more points you can earn at the end of each period.

276;La Guerre de l'Empereur: The Emperor's War, 1805-1815;"La Guerre de l'Empereur: The Emperor's War, 1805-1815 is a game of maneuver and battle between the forces under Napoleon Bonaparte and six other nations that both opposed and supported him at various times in the years between 1805 and 1815. Players vie for dominance of early 19th Century Europe. As the French player, you'll set Napoleon and his armies upon a continent whose differing political statures plays right into your hands. The greatest army in Europe is at your hands...&#10;&#10;Divide and conquer! As the British player, you'll utilize diplomacy, clever event play, a powerhouse economy and the greatest navy in the world to become the dominant nation. As Russia, Austria, Prussia, Spain or the Ottoman Empire, you must strike a balance between expansionist aggression and diplomatic harmony among your neighbors. Indeed, a nation must expand to triumph. However the means chosen to that end will largely decide the level of success. Play  the part of being everyone's friend and your nation will likely live in relative safety...and lose the game miserably. Play the part of the blind aggressor and you'll likely go down faster than the peace broker. Striking a balance is critical.&#10;&#10;The game map covers the territories from Scandinavia in the north to the Mediterranean and North Africa in the south, and from deep Russia in the east to Portugal and the Atlantic in the west. Movement is by areas (provinces) on land, and sea zones at sea. On land, the units of maneuver are (roughly) corps, while at sea each unit represents a naval squadron. When opposing land armies meet for battle, corps are broken down into divisions (loosely) and deployed on a eight zone battle map for combat resolution. The dice-less combat engine uses a system of battle options which are played and cross-referenced for resolution of actual casualties and morale loss. The number of battle options distributed, along with the initial army morale of the opposing sides, is determined by army size, nationality and leaders present. The battle options are of offensive and defensive nature. The offensive options cover standard maneuvers such as &quot;Flank Attack&quot;, &quot;Cavalry Charge&quot; and &quot;Assault&quot;, while the defensive options are things such as &quot;Refuse Flanks&quot;, &quot;Squares Formed&quot; and &quot;Reverse Slopes&quot;.&#10;&#10;The rules are relatively simple and fast moving, even though a host of subtleties and complexities of the Napoleonic period are represented within the game system. The means by which this relative simplicity was achieved was (largely) through the use of self-explanatory strategic event charts. Be warned: This game is easy to understand and play, but very difficult to master.&#10;&#10;The game system works the same whether you're playing with two players or seven. With multiple players, you'll need all of your diplomacy skills to enlist aid in achieving your goals. With fewer players, the event charts will handle the bulk of the diplomatic duties. Regardless of how many players you have, all seven major powers will actively participate to a greater or lesser degree.&#10;&#10;";1997;6.4589;3.3846;2;7;240;12;Economic, Napoleonic, Negotiation, Wargame;la guerre de l empereur emperor war maneuver battle force napoleon bonaparte nation oppose support time year vie dominance early th century europe french ll set napoleon army continent differ political stature right hand great army europe hand divide conquer british ll utilize diplomacy clever event powerhouse economy great navy world dominant nation russia austria prussia spain ottoman empire strike balance expansionist aggression diplomatic harmony neighbor nation expand triumph mean choose end largely decide success friend nation likely live relative safety miserably blind aggressor ll likely fast peace broker strike balance critical map cover territory scandinavia north mediterranean north africa south deep russia east portugal atlantic west area province land sea zone sea land unit maneuver roughly corp sea unit represent naval squadron oppose land army meet battle corp break division loosely deploy zone battle map combat resolution dice combat engine use battle option cross reference resolution actual casualty morale loss number battle option distribute initial army morale oppose side determine army size nationality leader present battle option offensive defensive nature offensive option cover standard maneuver flank attack cavalry charge assault defensive option thing refuse flank squares form reverse slope relatively simple fast host subtlety complexity napoleonic period represent mean relative simplicity achieve largely use self explanatory strategic event chart warn easy understand difficult master work seven multiple ll need diplomacy skill enlist aid achieve few event chart handle bulk diplomatic duty regardless seven major power actively participate great less degree
277;Res Publica;"In Res Publica you are the will of the people, guiding five ancient civilizations to greater heights of power and technology.&#10;&#10;Each turn, the active player makes a trade offer... and each player in turn responds in kind.

278;Catan Card Game;"Catan Card Game bears only a slight resemblance to The Settlers of Catan, the original game in the Catan series.  There are six resources: wool, wood, bricks, grain, ore, and gold. Before beginning the game, the players receive six square cards showing the resources, with a different die number on each card. In addition, the players start the game with two village cards and a road card connecting them. There are card stacks of more roads and villages, as well as cities, to be purchased during the game. With each new village or city comes two new resource cards. Villages and cities give victory points.&#10;&#10;When the number die is rolled, instead of collecting more cards, the players rotate the corresponding card 90 degrees to indicate a gain of one more of that resource; i.e., the brick card shows a picture of one brick on one edge of the card, two bricks on the next clockwise edge, three bricks along the third edge, and zero bricks on the fourth edge. There is also an event die, with five possible outcomes:&#10;&#10;&#10;     a reward for the player with more knight points or more 'windmill' points (a picture of a windmill on some cards),&#10;     a bonus resource,&#10;     an attack if a player has too many resources, and&#10;     one of six special events - civil war, conflict, master builder, plague, productive year, or progress.     &#10;&#10;&#10;There are 62 expansion cards in six stacks in the center of the table. Before beginning the game, players choose one stack, go through it, and choose three cards to hold in their hands. Forty-two of the expansion cards require spending resources to be put into play, gaining civic improvements or knights. Every civic improvement serves some useful function or adds victory points or both. Twenty of the cards are actions benefiting one of the players or harming the other. After a player pays to put a card down or uses an action card, he blindly draws a replacement. Unwanted or unusable cards can be traded in future turns. Some of the cards have flags on them, indicating victory points.&#10;&#10;Whoever first has twelve victory points wins the game!&#10;&#10;The Anniversary edition of this game (Jubil&auml;umsausgabe, tin box edition) can be found under a separate game entry due to some differences in content: Die Siedler von Catan: Das Kartenspiel &#226;&#128;&#147; 10th Anniversary Special Edition Tin Box.&#10;&#10;Belongs to the Catan Series.&#10;&#10;";1996;6.70132;2.4386;2;2;120;10;Card Game, City Building, Territory Building;catan card bear slight resemblance settler catan original catan series resource wool wood brick grain ore gold begin receive square card show resource different die number card addition start village card road card connect card road village city purchase new village city come new resource card village city number die instead collect card rotate corresponding card degree indicate gain resource e brick card show picture brick edge card brick clockwise edge brick edge zero brick fourth edge event die possible outcome reward knight windmill picture windmill card bonus resource attack resource special event civil war conflict master builder plague productive year progress card center table begin choose choose card hold hand card require spend resource gain civic improvement knight civic improvement serve useful function add card action benefit harm pay card use action card blindly draw replacement unwanted unusable card trade future card flag indicate anniversary jubil auml umsausgabe tin box find separate entry difference content die siedler von catan das kartenspiel th anniversary special tin box belong catan series
279;The Very Clever Pipe Game;"The game consists of a set of cards. The cards have white and black pipes in various six-outlet configurations, and players take turns placing them onto the table.  When a player constructs a completely closed-off section of pipe in their color, he takes all the cards from that section.  After all cards have been played, the player with the most scored cards wins.  Additionally, the cards also have two different floors (which appear underneath the pipes) that can be used to expand the game to a four-player affair.&#10;&#10;The game was re-released in 2002 with a reduced deck (48 cards instead of 120) as part of the Hip Pocket Games series.&#10;&#10;";1996;6.21525;1.5926;2;4;20;10;Abstract Strategy, Card Game;consist set card card white black pipe outlet configuration place table construct completely close section pipe color take card section card card additionally card different floor appear underneath pipe expand affair release reduced deck card instead hip pocket series
280;Neue Spiele im alten Rom;"Neue Spiele im Alten Rom (or New Games in Old Rome (NGIOR)) is a compendium of games from Reiner Knizia. In the box are fourteen games themed on ancient Rome. The games are themed to cover, albeit in a highly abstract fashion, the rise of Rome, the Roman Republic and finally, the Empire.&#10;&#10;(7 of the games are described below)&#10;&#10;The Wheel of History : 2-5 players&#10;&#10;This is an early version of what was to become Bunte Runde. 25 cards are laid out in a large circle, representing the tribes to be united under early Rome. Players may advance a pawn one, two or three spaces forwards and collect a card. Cards are scored on face value, but there are some quirks that vary this.&#10;&#10;The Seven Hills of Rome : 2 players&#10;&#10;This is one of the easier games in the compendium. The theme here is you are battling your opponent for control of the seven hills of Rome. The hills are represented by seven cards, numbered 1 to 7, laid out between the players. Cards are played from a hand against the 'hills' in an attempt to influence them to your side. You sum the hills you control at the end of the game, and the highest total wins.&#10;&#10;Mercator : 3-7 players&#10;&#10;This game is Medici&#039;s ancestor. It is a simplified version of Medici, with the chief differences being you can hold six cards on your ship, and you are competing for highest value totals only. The number of each suit taken is meaningless, except in a variant where you get paid a bonus if you get one of each. The game lasts only one round. Medici is worth purchasing on its own, but this is still worth a look.&#10;&#10;Imperium : 3-5 players&#10;&#10;The aim is to earn points for control of each of the 9 areas on the board. The game lasts 9 turns, and at the end of each turn, the area matching the turn number is evaluated for control and points are awarded. On your turn, 3 cards are revealed simultaneously. These cards are numbered 1 to 9, with 2 additional banner cards. The numbers correspond to the areas you want to place control markers into. The banner cards indicate you want one or two extra chips placed in the indicated area. After control markers are placed, the current turn's area is evaluated - points being awarded to the winner and perhaps the second and third places as well. After 9 turns, the player with the most points wins. As you progress, the points awarded for each area increases, giving a nice feeling of acceleration.&#10;&#10;Senator : 2-3 players&#10;&#10;You play a Roman faction trying to position your people (a hand of cards) into the senate. They can only get their via the senate steps. The board is a grid of 5x5 spaces, The 9 spaces in the center are the senate, while 12 of the remaining 16 are the steps spaces that run around the perimeter of the senate. Cards are placed initially on the steps, and then pushed into the senate by placing more cards on the steps.&#10;&#10;Circus Maximus : 3-5 players&#10;&#10;A simple chariot racing game where players are competing to be the first to get their team of three chariots around the hex map circuit and onto the podium. Each player has a set of cards face up in front of them, numbered 1 to 5. To move a chariot they select up to three cards per chariot which that is the movement allowance for that piece. The movement off each card must be in a straight line, so some rather clumsy cornering ability is built into the game. Cards used by a chariot are turned face down, becoming unavailable for the other chariots still to move. Each chariot must be moved at least once per turn, if possible. Therefore, the trick is to maximize your movement with your 15 points each turn.&#10;&#10;Consul : 2-4 players&#10;&#10;This is an intriguing memory game, that, like most of the games in this compendium, have a hard time being fitted into a theme! Twenty-five cards are turned face down in a grid. Players start the game each holding three cards in their hand. On their turn, players make a bid to take a turn. The highest bid gets to turn up cards until they choose to finish, or make a mistake. Cards in a set can be of the same value, or same color, or both.

292;Attacke;"Themed as a joust of knights, Attacke is a simple card laying contest. The cards are in 5 colors and are numbered 2,3,4,5, &amp; 7. From a hand of five, a player lays one or more cards of one color, declares the total value, and draws one card. Following players must lay cards to beat that total in that color to stay in the round. If you can't or choose not to play, you're out and draw a final card. The round continues with players adding more cards to their total or dropping out until one player remains and that player takes a token in that color. There are joker cards (shields) of 7 or 10. First to win 4 out of the 5 colored tokens, wins the game.&#10;&#10;Ridiculously simple and really great fun.

294;Keydom;"Independently produced by British game designer Richard Breese, the three hundred copies of this game sold within hours of its initial offering at Essen 1998.  Players represent a family of medieval professionals, such as Stonemasons or Fishermen.  Using a set of numbered tokens and some misdirection, players try to achieve control in several areas of the board.  Perhaps they are seeking resources.  Or perhaps they will use their hard-fought resources to purchase special actions, magical spells, or a piece of the royal Keylore.  The first player to acquire all three pieces of regalia and take them to the throne room is crowned King and is the winner.

The cities themselves have a variable number of spaces for players to develop business branches within, or alternatively establish new trade routes into wider reaching cities and towns.

Players take turns choosing any tile from the trail, but can never turn back to choose a tile they have already passed. There are 15 different sets of tiles (three sets each of 8, 6, 4, 2, and 1), and when the last tile of any set has been claimed, the player holding the most in that set scores that number of points, while the player holding second most scores half that number.

Actually very simple, players take turns to put their colored pieces in different rooms. Whenever a row, column, diagonal or room is full, it is scored, with the majority holder getting the value of the length, and any minority holders losing points. All lines or rooms are marked off when scored and when you run out of pieces to place, you must move a piece, which means you can suddenly lose a potential score you were building.&#10;&#10;";1988;6.74829;2.3514;2;6;45;10;Abstract Strategy, Ancient;long print popular wolfgang kramer publish franckh kosmos long box series actually simple colored piece different room row column diagonal room majority holder get value length minority holder line room mark run piece place piece mean suddenly potential build
304;Evergreen;"Combination of card play and timing from Wolfgang Kramer &amp; Michael Kiesling. There are some recording artists who are famous for singing certain standards. Players are putting on concerts and use numbered cards for each performer to take control of that singer. The singers are represented by old fashioned 45s, with a disc in the center showing values from 5 to 12. Each time a singer is transferred from control of one player to another, the disc is rotated, so the value can rise to 12, but next move, it drops to 5 again. You try to gain control of an artist at high value, or pass artists from one player to another to make them devalue. Scoring occurs when players choose to put on concerts at the end of their turn, including a gala show which doubles the value. The game rules state that the designers produced this game by phone and fax, without ever meeting. Perhaps that shows, as it has interest, but the game uses a sand-timer to apply pressure to your decisions.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.54669;1.8571;2;6;30;12;Card Game, Music;combination card timing wolfgang kramer amp michael kiesle recording artist famous singe certain standard put concert use numbered card performer singer singer represent old fashioned disc center show value time singer transfer disc rotate value rise drop try gain artist high value pass artist devalue occur choose concert end include gala double value state designer produce phone fax meet show interest use sand timer apply pressure decision

308;Santa Fe;"Each game is made up of rounds. A round begins with all players playing one card from their hands and placing it face down on the table. Then, all cards are exposed simultaneously.&#10;&#10;There are 66 City Cards and each carry a name of a city along with a number value (ranging from 2 to 7). Since the trains begin their expansion from the easternmost part of the board, the farther west the city, the higher its number value. Players score points only for City Cards that are played and placed face up. Cards that remain unplayed in hands have no value. The numerical value of a City Card is multiplied by the number of railroads connected to it.&#10;&#10;Players may also play a Double turn Card, a combination of a City Card with a Branch Line card or a combination of a Double Turn Card and a Branch Line Card.&#10;&#10;A Double Turn Card allows a player to place two pieces of track in both track phases of a turn (although only one piece of track may be placed if desired). Furthermore, all bonuses are doubled during the round that card is played.&#10;&#10;Each Railroad has two Branch Line Cards and a player may pay $1 and draw one of them. (Players may only hold one Branch Line Card in their hands at any one time.) If held, the Branch Line Card must be played immediately on the next round in conjunction with either a City or Double Turn Card.&#10;&#10;Play of a Branch Line Card allows a player to start a new route of track for the named railroad from any city that railroad connects, thereby extending the railroad.&#10;&#10;After exposing a card, the round continues with two turns of laying track. Players do not control any specific rail line. Each player can place track on any color provided that the played track connects to an existing corresponding rail network on the board. Once all track is placed, all players replenish their hands (up to five cards). The First Player passes the First Player Train to the player on the left (who becomes the First Player for the subsequent round) and the next round begins.&#10;&#10;The first player to connect the first railroad to any city earns $2. Certain cities are marked with colored squares (matching the colors of certain railroads). Should a corresponding color railroad enter that city, the player making that connection gets a bonus of $4. Double Turn Cards double all bonuses in a round.&#10;&#10;When all track pieces of all the railroads have been played or if a player is unable to play any piece of track because all playable railroads are &quot;dead-ended&quot;, the game ends and points are tallied.&#10;&#10;Points are received in two ways. First, players receive 1 point for each $1 they have. Second, each City Card is worth its value times the number of different rail lines connected to it. The player with the highest total wins! (In case of a tie, the player with the most City Cards valued at &quot;7&quot; is declared the victor.)&#10;&#10;";1992;6.94839;2.2;2;5;70;10;Trains;begin card hand place face table card expose simultaneously city card carry city number value range train begin easternmost far west city high number value city card place face card remain unplayed hand value numerical value city card multiply number railroad connect double card combination city card branch line card combination double card branch line card double card allow place piece track track piece track place desire furthermore bonus double card railroad branch line card pay draw hold branch line card hand time hold branch line card immediately conjunction city double card branch line card allow start new route track name railroad city railroad connect extend railroad expose card continue lay track specific rail line place track color provide track connect exist corresponding rail network track place replenish hand card pass train left subsequent begin connect railroad city earn certain city mark colored square match color certain railroad corresponding color railroad enter city make connection get bonus double card double bonus track piece railroad unable piece track playable railroad dead end end tally receive way receive second city card worth value time number different rail line connect high total case tie city card value declare victor

314;Highlanders;"Rheingold is basically a Castle Risk-style game without the dice combat. The board depicts, rather fetchingly, eighteen castles on or near the Rhine. These are given point values depending on their size or importance, ranging between 1 and 3. The castles are linked to numerous movement areas by tracks meaning that some of the castles are in powerful positions (especially those providing or guarding a river bridge) and others are stuck out on a limb. At the start of the game, the castles aren't owned by anyone and the winner of the game is the one with the most points of captured castles at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;";1993;6.17996;2.0;3;5;90;12;Medieval, Wargame;rheingold basically castle risk style dice combat depict fetchingly eighteen castle near rhine give value depend size importance range castle link numerous area track mean castle powerful position especially provide guard river bridge stick limb start castle aren t own winner capture castle end
316;Chase;"Each player starts Chase with a row of nine dice on their side of the hexagonal game board, with the faces of those d6s adding up to 25. On a turn, a player moves a die as many spaces in a straight line as the value showing on the die's face. A die can't move through another piece, but it can wrap around the side of the board and it can bounce off the front or back wall at an angle to move its full distance.&#10;&#10;If you land a die on an opponent's die, that second die is removed and the value of that die added to the lowest die on the opponent's team, keeping their pip count at 25. (If a die reaches 6, you add any remaining speed to what is now the lowest die.) If you land on one of your own dice, you bump that die one space in the same direction, possibly leading to another bump or a capture.&#10;&#10;Instead of moving, if you have two dice next to one another, you can spend the turn adjusting their values while keeping their sum the same. If, for example, you have a 2 and 5 adjacent to one another, you can change them to 1 &amp; 6, 3 &amp; 4, 4 &amp; 3, 5 &amp; 2, or 6 &amp; 1.&#10;&#10;The center of the board has a chamber on it. You cannot move a die through the chamber. If you land a die on the chamber, you split the value of that die on two dice as evenly as possible. (You start the game with one spare.) Those dice emerge from the chamber on spaces adjacent to it, possibly resulting in bumps or captures.&#10;&#10;If you knock an opponent down to only four dice, then they have a pip count below 25 and they lose the game.&#10;&#10;";1985;6.82064;2.6579;2;2;45;10;Abstract Strategy, Dice;start chase row dice hexagonal face d add die space straight line value show die face die t piece wrap bounce wall angle distance land die opponent die second die remove value die add low die opponent team keep pip count die reach add remain speed low die land dice bump die space direction possibly lead bump capture instead dice spend adjust value keep sum example adjacent change amp amp amp amp amp center chamber die chamber land die chamber split value die dice evenly possible start spare dice emerge chamber space adjacent possibly result bump capture knock opponent dice pip count

320;Scrabble;"In this classic word game, players use their seven drawn letter-tiles to form words on the gameboard. Each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses.  But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word.  This leads to slightly tactical play, as potential words are rejected because they would give an opponent too much access to the better bonus spaces.&#10;&#10;Skip-a-cross was licensed by Selchow &amp; Righter and manufactured by Cadaco.

322;Tonga Bonga;"In Tonga Bonga, each player pilots a ship around a little group of islands with the goal of visiting four of the five remote islands and returning to Tonga Bonga Bay.&#10;&#10;Winning the race does not win the game, however; what matters is having the most money. Each player has room for three sailors (represented by dice) on their ship, and at the start of a round, in order players decide how much money to offer the sailors who will serve as their captain and first mate that round. (The cabin boy always works for free.) Next, in order players roll their dice, then assign one die to each other ship &mdash; never their own! If you place a die with an equal or higher pip value on a ship where a die already present, you bump that earlier die to a lesser role. (In short, the ships always end up with the highest die in the captain position.) One side of each die has a seasick sailor, who doesn't go to sea that round, so not all ships will necessarily be full.&#10;&#10;Once all the dice have been placed, in order players move their ship, ideally reaching islands before others and leaving one of your tokens there. Whenever you land on an island, you reach $25 from the bank, but you must then pay $5 to each player who landed there ahead of you. At the end of a round, players collect the wages next to the captain and first mate spots holding their dice.&#10;&#10;A player who has visited four islands can return to Tonga Bonga Bay, collecting $10 when they dock there.

334;Advance to Boardwalk;"Don't let the name fool you. The game has nothing to do with Monopoly. The name was obviously chosen in an attempt to capitalize on that mega-selling monster.&#10;&#10;There are four tracts of land illustrated on the board, which depicts an ocean-front boardwalk. Each tract of land contains five properties valued from $1 million to $8 million. Each turn, a player rolls two regular dice and one special die. The special die has four sides depicting a color matching one of the land tracts, with the other two sides depicting a 'W' and 'F' respectively. The number rolled on the regular two dice is the amount of money the player can spend on development, while the color depicted on the special die is the tract of land he may build on. Thus, if a player rolled an 8 and a red, he has $8 million to spend on developing buildings in the red tract. He can split this $8 million as he sees fit. For example, he may build a building on the $5 million plot and one on the $3 million plot; or he may opt to build one building on the $8 million plot. Quite a few building options here.&#10;&#10;The 'W' on the special die is a 'wild' color. If it was rolled instead of a color, the player may select which tract he wishes to build on. The 'F' means that a player draws a Fortune card and does not build that turn. Fortune cards allow a player to perform a variety of actions, including constructing extra buildings, moving one of his already placed buildings, removing an opponent's building, etc. A player may play one of these Fortune cards per turn.&#10;&#10;When a player constructs a building and obtains the most buildings on a particular plot, he takes the deed to that property and moves his token along the boardwalk an amount equal to the value of the deed. If a player wrested control of the deed from an opponent, the opponent is then moved back that number of spaces. Buildings are placed on the board in a fashion identical to that used in Manhattan...they are stacked on top of existing buildings. If there is a tie for the most buildings, the player who built first on that plot possesses the deed.&#10;&#10;Some have described this game as 'Manhattan lite', and they're not far off. One certainly has similar thought processes and must constantly keep an eye out for optimum plays which will wrest control of deeds (control of buildings in Manhattan) from opponents. There's another planning element thrown in, too. Certain spaces along the boardwalk are marked with an 'F'. If a player advances his token to one of these locations, he draws a Fortune card. These cards can be extremely powerful and cause a severe swing in deed controls. Thus, it is not always wise to go for the largest deed acquisition if a lesser gain would allow you to move your token onto an 'F' location. Clever.&#10;&#10;The game continues until one player has placed all of his buildings (sounds a bit like Rheinl&#195;&#164;nder, doesn't it?) or until one player has reached the end of the boardwalk. The player with the highest total value of deeds is the victor.&#10;&#10;";1985;5.42863;1.5278;2;4;60;8;Economic;don t let fool monopoly obviously choose attempt capitalize mega selling monster tract land illustrate depict ocean boardwalk tract land contain property value million million regular dice special die special die side depict color matching land tract side depict w f respectively number regular dice money spend development color depict special die tract land build red million spend develop building red tract split million see fit example build building million plot million plot opt build building million plot building option w special die wild color instead color select tract wish build f mean draw fortune card build fortune card allow perform variety action include construct extra building place building remove opponent building etc fortune card construct building obtain building particular plot take deed property token boardwalk equal value deed wrest deed opponent opponent number space building place fashion identical manhattan exist building tie building build plot possess deed describe manhattan lite far certainly similar thought process constantly eye optimum wrest deed building manhattan opponent planning element throw certain space boardwalk mark f advance token location draw fortune card card extremely powerful cause severe swing deed wise large deed acquisition less gain allow token f location clever continue place building sound bit like rheinl nder doesn t reach end boardwalk high total value deed victor

338;Bargain Hunter;"This game illustrates Herr Rosenberg&#039;s talent for unique card games.  The deck is one through nine in six suits, with two of each card (two 1s, two 2s, etc.).  After the initial hand of eight is dealt, players select one card value to collect, which is placed face-up in front of each player.  A fairly standard trick-taking game takes place with the remaining cards, with players following suit if they can.  If you cannot, the card you play can be trump, if you desire.  If two cards of the same suit/value appear, the second can be declared as either high or low.  When a player wins a trick, the cards of the same value they are collecting are placed in his 'good' pile, with each worth one point.  All the rest are put in the 'bad' pile, with each worth minus one point.  However at the end of each hand, you can convert one value of cards from your 'bad' pile onto the 'good' pile.  Of course, if you had enough of them, you'll be collecting that value for the next hand...&#10;&#10;";1998;6.69097;1.8657;3;4;45;10;Card Game;illustrate herr rosenberg talent unique card deck suit card etc initial hand deal select card value collect place face fairly standard trick taking take place remain card follow suit card trump desire card suit value appear second declare high low trick card value collect place good pile worth rest bad pile worth minus end hand convert value card bad pile good pile course ll collect value hand
340;Frank's Zoo;"This game is played in several hands. In each hand the players try to be the first to get rid of all of their cards. Their scores are based on how early in the hand they get rid of all their cards. There are two ways to play: you can play where all hands are played the same, or you can play the game with changing partners.&#10;&#10;This is a climbing game, similar to The Great Dalmuti, Tichu, and others.  The difference here is that the ranks are different kinds of colorfully illustrated animals. Each is scared away only by certain other animals.  Players set out one to whatever cards of a particular variety, and someone can play onto that pile only if they have more of that animal or an equal number of some animal that can scare it away.  Players get points by playing all their cards, collecting lions, and collecting a hedgehog.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.61653;1.5201;3;7;60;10;Animals, Card Game;hand hand try rid card base early hand rid card way hand change partner climbing similar great dalmuti tichu difference rank different kind colorfully illustrate animal scared away certain animal set card particular variety pile animal equal number animal scare away card collect lion collect hedgehog

344;Classic Art;"In Classic Art, first released as Members Only, players attempt to predict how many works of art will be present in five exhibitions. The riskier your predictions in a season, the more you score &mdash; but only if you're correct, of course!&#10;&#10;The game consists of 65 cards, with 13 cards in each of five categories; eleven of the cards are &quot;positive&quot; and two are &quot;negative&quot;. At the start of each season, players get a hand of cards (7-11 depending on the player count) and two cards are placed face up from the deck in their respective exhibitions.&#10;&#10;In the first round of the season, players may predict how many works of art will be in an exhibition at the end of the current season by placing 1-2 tokens (along with their high risk token) on a prediction space. Each exhibition allows you to bet on whether the art will be rare (bet spaces 1-4) or plentiful (bet spaces 5-8). In each subsequent round, a player must place two cards from their hand in the appropriate exhibitions, then they may place a prediction. They may place only one &quot;double token&quot; prediction in a season, and predicting is optional. When all players have only three cards in hand, they each discard one face down, then place the other two cards in exhibitions. Whenever a negative card and positive card appear in an exhibition, remove them.&#10;&#10;At the end of a season, players score for correct predictions. If art in an exhibition is &quot;rare&quot;, i.e., four or fewer works, then all plentiful bets fail, and vice versa. What's more, a rare bet succeeds only if the number of works is equal to or fewer than the bet, e.g., if you bet 3, then you succeed only if three or fewer works of art are present. A plentiful bid succeeds only if the number of works is equal to or more than the bet. The riskier the bet, the higher the payout per token in that successful bet, with players recording points separately for each exhibition.&#10;&#10;At the end of a season, tokens on failed bets (other than the high risk ones) are removed from play, while tokens on successful bids are returned to players. If a player has zero or one tokens at the end of a season, all of their tokens are returned to them.&#10;&#10;A player can score at most 10 points in an exhibition. Continue playing seasons until at the end of a season, each exhibition has at least one player who has scored 5 points in it. The game ends at the point, and players tally their scores &mdash; but tokens in the 0-4 range in an exhibition are worthless. Whoever scores the most points wins!&#10;&#10;In Members Only players bet on odd things like how many royal scandals will happen in a month, and in Glenn's Gallery, another version of this design, players bet on the number of customers who will show up to look at types of art, but otherwise gameplay is nearly identical to Classic Art. The only difference is that each player has a dedicated &quot;double bid&quot; token instead of being allowed to bid two tokens once per season.&#10;&#10;Classic Art includes a two-player variant that can be used in prior releases. After dealing eleven cards to each player, set up a ten-card &quot;house&quot; deck. On each player's turn, they play the top card of the house in addition to two cards from their hand. In the last round, play the final two cards from the house along with the chosen two cards from both players.&#10;&#10;";1996;6.59574;2.087;2;5;60;10;Card Game;classic art release member attempt predict work art present exhibition risky prediction season mdash correct course consist card card category card positive negative start season hand card depend count card place face deck respective exhibition season predict work art exhibition end current season place token high risk token prediction space exhibition allow bet art rare bet space plentiful bet space subsequent place card hand appropriate exhibition place prediction place double token prediction season predict optional card hand discard face place card exhibition negative card positive card appear exhibition remove end season correct prediction art exhibition rare e few work plentiful bet fail vice versa rare bet succeed number work equal few bet e g bet succeed few work art present plentiful bid succeed number work equal bet risky bet high payout token successful bet record separately exhibition end season token fail bet high risk one remove token successful bid return zero token end season token return exhibition continue season end season exhibition end tally mdash token range exhibition worthless member bet odd thing like royal scandal happen month glenn gallery bet number customer look art nearly identical classic art difference dedicated double bid token instead allow bid token season classic art include prior release deal card set card house deck card house addition card hand final card house choose card

Essentially, players buy goods, load them onto wagons and send them for maximum profit in other cities.&#10;&#10;The whole game looks very inviting. The medieval cities depicted on the board, together with the player crests, cardboard coins, money pouches, sticker decorated wagons and wooden commodity pieces, immediately creates the right atmosphere for the players.&#10;&#10;There are six cities - Paris, Cologne, Brugge, Gent, Vienna and Genoa - which are interconnected by roads. Three wagons carry goods from one city to another. No-one owns the wagons or controls any of them single-handedly, and in principle a player can put commodities on any transport. There are six different commodities - salt, iron, wine, silk, cloth and food - all of limited supply.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to make money by delivering goods to the towns, and use the money to buy increases in status.  The game ends after a certain number of deliveries have been made and the winner is the player with the highest level of status.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.7325;3.0131;2;4;120;10;Economic, Medieval, Negotiation, Transportation;medieval trade commerce die h auml ndler set europe trade wagon carry ware city essentially buy good load wagon send maximum profit city look invite medieval city depict crest cardboard coin money pouch sticker decorate wagon wooden commodity piece immediately create right atmosphere city paris cologne brugge gent vienna genoa interconnect road wagon carry good city own wagon single handedly principle commodity transport different commodity salt iron wine silk cloth food limited supply money deliver good town use money buy increase status end certain number delivery winner high status
350;Hattrick;"extrapolated from the Game Cabinet:&#10;&#10;A card game with an unusual rule where two tricks can be opened at the same time&#10;&#10;The player to the left of the dealer starts by playing any one card. Now each player follows in clockwise order playing a card, until everybody played one. The second player has the option to play either a card with the same color, or to open a second trick by playing a card of an different color next to the already played card. When someone plays a second color, he starts a second trick on the table. If the second player started a second trick, the third player just has the options to follow either one of the colors or discard a card of the third color (pass). He may not place a card of the third color on one of the existing tricks or start a third trick. If the second player followed the color of the first card, the third one has the option to start a 2nd trick (and so on).&#10;&#10;The players who played the card with the highest number in the respective trick win the respective cards. They place them visible to everyone in front of themselves on the table, stacked by colors, so everyone can see which color they are collecting. The player with the highest card in both tricks starts to play a card for the next round&#10;&#10;After all rounds are completed highest score wins.&#10;&#10;3rd and 4th version of Sticheln by the same game designer allow to play Hattrick, too.

352;Trumpet;"In this light, short trick-taking game, there are six suits with cards numbered one through eleven, plus 3 wild cards. If you take a trick, you advance your scoring token, however each scoring space can only be occupied by one person, jumping the piece[s] immediately ahead of you. In addition, there are certain spaces which allow that player to set one of the suits as trump. Eventually all the suits are established as some form of trump, however each of them is ranked top to bottom. Once one of the players enters the home stretch of the scoring track, players can chose to move the leaders back a space instead of moving themselves up, but the winner is the player who crosses the finish line first.&#10;&#10;Won Games Magazine Game of the Year award in 1991.&#10;&#10;";1990;6.23365;1.4355;2;6;45;9;Card Game;light short trick taking suit card number plus wild card trick advance token space occupy person jump piece immediately ahead addition certain space allow set suit trump eventually suit establish form trump rank enter home stretch track choose leader space instead winner cross finish line magazine year award
354;Stick 'Em;"In the trick-taking card game Stick 'Em, first released as Sticheln, players seek to gather points each hand by taking as many cards as possible of all but one color, while trying to avoid cards of one color of their choosing.&#10;&#10;In more detail, at the beginning of each hand, each player simultaneously selects and reveals one card from their hand, with the color of this card representing their &quot;pain&quot; color. At the end of the hand, each card of this color that they've collected (including their initial choice from their hand) is worth negative points equal to the card's face value. Each card of another color that this player has collected is worth 1 point.&#10;&#10;To play out the hand, the active player leads a card, then each other player in clockwise order plays one card. If all cards are of the same color, then whoever played the highest card collects these cards, then leads the next trick; if all cards are not of the same color, then whoever played the highest card of a color not initially led collects these cards, then leads the next trick. (One exception: A zero card can never win a trick.) In effect, each color played in a particular trick that doesn't match the color of the card led is considered a trump card, and the highest trump wins. In the event of a tie, the earlier played card breaks the tie.&#10;&#10;Play as many hands as the number of players in the game, summing each player's points over those hands to determine a winner.&#10;&#10;Some versions of Sticheln allow for play with up to six players, while the third and fourth German editions of the game include enough cards to allow for play with up to eight players. (These versions also allow players to play the game Hattrick by the same designer, with rules for this game included as a variant.)&#10;&#10;";1993;7.04618;1.9038;3;8;60;10;Card Game;trick take card stick em release sticheln seek gather hand take card possible color try avoid card color choosing detail beginning hand simultaneously select reveal card hand color card represent pain color end hand card color ve collect include initial hand worth negative equal card face value card color collect worth hand active lead card clockwise order card card color high card collect card lead trick card color high card color initially lead collect card lead trick exception zero card trick effect color particular trick doesn t match color card lead consider trump card high trump event tie early card break tie hand number sum hand determine winner sticheln allow fourth german include card allow allow hattrick designer include

366;Viva Pamplona!;"In this fluffy, dice-intensive game set in Pamplona, Spain, players control 3-runner teams competing in the running of the bulls.  By rolling the dice and moving their runners (the most significant decisions are which runners to move, and how far to move them when a choice is available), the players try to keep their teams in front of and as close to the bull as possible, while pushing other runners into more cowardly locations.  The reason for all this is that after all players have had their turns, there's a chance that Toro will attack, and the players whose runners are in the most dangerous positions will score the most points.&#10;&#10;";1992;6.36903;1.3725;2;6;45;8;Racing;fluffy dice intensive set pamplona spain runner team compete running bull dice runner significant decision runner far available try team close bull possible push runner cowardly location reason chance toro attack runner dangerous position

374;Colorado County;"In this unique game, players buy plots of land on a large, grass-covered board. After a random-like placement of twelve placement markers, the players simultaneously bid for cards which will allow the players to put control markers on the board in the positions indicated on the cards. However, only three cards are available, so only the top three bidders will receive a prize. As if the pressure wasn't enough, players receive a supply of bidding chips (called cowboy tiles) at the beginning of the game, which are only replenished by bidding lowest or zero (missing out on a card/placement) or by selling an owned plot (only 4 or 5 sales per game).&#10;&#10;Some of the plots that the players own will score differently, depending on the timing.

Players may finance their acquisitions with loans from the Bank, although the interest rate may become exorbitant.&#10;&#10;Lancashire Railways is the first game in the Early Railways Series and is the progenitor of later Wallace titles such as Age of Steam and Railroad Tycoon.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.89167;3.1429;3;6;120;12;Economic, Trains;lancashire railway train birth commercial railroad central england silicon valley day manchester hub advanced engineering manufacturing liverpool large port manchester need access export cloth machinery lancashire railway set era unrestrained growth development start railway attempt acquire right way auction finance acquisition loan bank interest rate exorbitant lancashire railway early railway series progenitor later wallace title age steam railroad tycoon
380;Polarity;"Once rare and mysterious, now thankfully back in print, Polarity is a 2-player game using lots of magnets (so keep it away from credit cards, watches and so on). The plastic coated pieces look like Reversi/Othello discs, with black and white faces. Each piece contains a magnet, with the black side being North and the white side being South. Each player gets a stack, one plays black one plays white. A neutral red piece goes in the center of the game cloth and players start by place five each of their stack around the cloth. These flat pieces are the foundations.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you take one piece from your stack into your hand, then bring it to bear against one of your foundations. You keep your color face up, so the opposing polarity bears against your foundation piece. This way, you can very carefully balance your new piece in the air against the foundation stone! This is just fantastic to see. The board fills up with lots of discs teetering at 45 degrees, ready to fly about if the balances are upset.&#10;&#10;Get it right and your stack is one piece smaller. Make a mistake and  your turn ends. Either a piece falls flat somewhere (becoming a new foundation) or pieces jump together making towers or into your hand. Your opponent takes the tower you accidentally made and places it their side up where they like. Towers get you points at the game end.&#10;&#10;If a piece jumps to the stone in your hand, they both go back on your stack. The game ends when one player finishes their stack and points are calculated based upon towers and discs remaining. Causing the red piece to jump to another loses you the game outright.&#10;&#10;To be honest, the scoring matters less than the tension and joy of watching the natural but weird force of magnetism at play. Because the discs are discs, they can easily roll around, causing domino effects. Because the towers increase the magnetic pull, they make it so much harder to find a safe spot to play.&#10;&#10;If you want a strange fun game to amaze your friends and family, Polarity is hard to beat. If you want a serious 2-player game, you may prefer other abstracts. The rules could do with being shorter and simpler. Otherwise, a joyous game.&#10;&#10;Comment from the designer &quot;Polarity began as a sculpture. Polarity is zen. It represents that point where absolute opposites merge. In this case, the poles of the magnetic field. The quality of play is determined by one's ability to perceive balance in the midst of extremes. Each game is unique and can never be reproduced. It is in that uniqueness that I was awarded a patent from the U.S. Pat. &amp; Trdmks. office for magnetic principle. The strategy must be viewed 3-dimensionally. It is not just control of a 2-dimensional board but must include the space above and below the playing surface.&quot;&#10;&#10;";1986;6.34947;1.6814;2;4;20;8;Abstract Strategy, Action / Dexterity;rare mysterious thankfully print polarity lot magnet away credit card watch plastic coat piece look like reversi othello disc black white face piece contain magnet black north white south get black white neutral red piece go center cloth start place cloth flat piece foundation piece hand bring bear foundation color face oppose polarity bear foundation piece way carefully balance new piece air foundation stone fantastic fill lot disc teeter degree ready fly balance upset right piece small mistake end piece fall flat new foundation piece jump make tower hand opponent take tower accidentally place like tower end piece jump stone hand end finish calculate base tower disc remaining cause red piece jump outright honest matter tension joy watch natural weird force magnetism disc disc easily cause domino effect tower increase magnetic pull hard find safe spot want strange fun amaze friend family polarity hard beat want prefer abstract short simple joyous comment designer polarity begin sculpture polarity zen represent absolute opposite merge case pole magnetic field quality determine perceive balance midst extreme unique reproduce uniqueness award patent u pat amp trdmks office magnetic principle strategy view dimensionally dimensional include space surface
382;Heimlich & Co.;"The game board in Heimlich &amp; Co. is an oval movement track, with points allocated to the various spaces. Seven differently colored &quot;spies&quot; are placed on the board. On a player's turn, they roll a die, then move any combination of characters forward that number of spaces. The newly-moved spies then score points based on their new location. However, the trick here is that each player's color isn't known until the end of the game, so players are encouraged to deduce which color belongs to whom.&#10;&#10;Heimlich &amp; Co. includes advanced rules which allow players to score more points at the end of the game for correctly guessing everyone's identity.&#10;&#10;(&quot;Heimlich&quot;, by the way, is a German adjective meaning secretly or slyly.)&#10;&#10;";1984;6.46989;1.4745;2;7;30;8;Bluffing, Spies / Secret Agents;heimlich amp co oval track allocate space seven differently colored spy place die combination character forward number space newly spy base new location trick color isn t know end encourage deduce color belong heimlich amp co include advanced allow end correctly guess identity heimlich way german adjective meaning secretly slyly
384;TurfMaster;"Turfmaster is a horse-racing game for two to eight players, played over a &quot;meet&quot; of three races.  The board is two-sided, and hurdles are provided so that players can choose flat racing or steeplechases (races with fences that the horses must jump).&#10;&#10;Players each have their own deck of 32 movement cards, dice and a horse of their own colour.  Ten cards are randomly selected for each race, with two cards left over which can be drawn for use in any one race.  Cards played in a race are removed from the game.&#10;&#10;A round consists of two parts.  First all players simultaneously select a card and move the number on the played card (if able), in position order.  After this, a single pair of dice is rolled by one player (the rolling player rotates throughout the game).  The player rolling the dice decides if all horses move the value of one or both of the dice and all horses move (again in position order).&#10;&#10;Like a real horse race, inside position is important.  The game has rules for lane changing, blocking and handicaps on the leaders which restrict the values of the cards the players whose horses are in the first three spots are able to play, or how much (or even IF) a horse in one of those spots can move on a dice roll.  To try to counter this, players have &quot;joker&quot; cards which can be used to avoid being handicapped when in one of the first three spots.  The steeplechase introduces additional rules for jumping fences.  Horses can be forced to pull up short of a fence (because they are blocked on the other side and have nowhere to land safely) or can occasionally fall if their movement ends on a fence - which takes four movement points to jump.  Players will need to plan their moves carefully to prevent other players from getting their full amount of movement, and to avoid having players doing that to them.&#10;&#10;The first four horses to finish each race are awarded points towards their final total.&#10;&#10;The game comes in two versions.  The regular version which has single-colour plastic horses, and the &quot;DeLuxe&quot; version which has hand-painted pewter horses (each jockey wears a different coloured jersey) - each in a little protective case.   In addition, several other tracks are available - there are two course collections which can be purchased separately and a third (web-published) collection.&#10;&#10;";1998;7.24914;1.949;2;8;75;10;Animals, Racing, Sports;turfmaster horse racing meet race side hurdle provide choose flat racing steeplechase race fence horse jump deck card dice horse colour card randomly select race card leave draw use race card race remove consist part simultaneously select card number card able position order single pair dice rolling rotate dice decide horse value dice horse position order like real horse race inside position important lane change blocking handicap leader restrict value card horse spot able horse spot dice try joker card avoid handicap spot steeplechase introduce additional jumping fence horse force pull short fence block land safely occasionally fall end fence take jump need plan carefully prevent get avoid have horse finish race award final total come regular single colour plastic horse deluxe hand paint pewter horse jockey wear different coloured jersey little protective case addition track available course purchase separately web publish

388;Finale;"Another game in Kosmos two-player series, this game casts players as soccer (football) coaches on opposite teams.  Players use special square cards to represent the players they have in each of the positions: strikers, mid-fielders, defenders, and goalies.  Each turn, one of the two players will be the offense based on a simultaneous selection of cards from their respective play books.  Then players allocate their players to the current play, which rotates the used players.  A player card has a number of soccer balls on each edge, which tells how many skill points the player will contribute to a given play, and using the player (thusly rotating him) might actually weaken him for the next use.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented as:&#10;&#10;    Tooor!&#10;&#10;&#10;";1998;5.74142;1.8611;2;2;30;12;Card Game, Sports;kosmos series cast soccer football coach opposite team use special square card represent position striker mid fielder defender goalie offense base simultaneous selection card respective book allocate current rotate card number soccer ball edge tell skill contribute give thusly rotate actually weaken use implement tooor
392;Brawl;"From the Cheapass Games web site: (6 November 2011)&#10;&#10;History: In 1999, James Ernest refined his notion of Real Time card games. Building on his first real time card game, Falling, which was multi-player with a dealer, he created Brawl, a two-player card game with no dealer.&#10;&#10;Summary: Brawl is a lightning-fast combat game where two players burn through their 35-card decks in about 35 seconds. Each deck contains a unique mix of cards, and each deck requires a slightly different playing style to win.&#10;&#10;Mechanics: Each player takes one deck, sets a &quot;base&quot; card on the table, and begins to play. Players play their cards (Hit, Block, Clear, etc.) as fast as they like, trying to win each Base by playing more Hits on their own side. At the bottom of both decks are three Freeze cards. When every base is Frozen, the game is over.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.36668;1.3661;2;7;15;10;Card Game, Fighting, Print & Play, Real-time;cheapass web site november history james ernest refine notion real time card build real time card fall multi dealer create brawl card dealer summary brawl lightning fast combat burn card deck second deck contain unique mix card deck require slightly different playing style take deck set base card table begin card hit block clear etc fast like try base hit deck freeze card base freeze
394;Kahuna;"&quot;Who will rule the South Seas? Two Kahuna - ancient sorcerers of the Pacific - compete for dominance on an archipelago consisting of twelve small islands. Using their magic and wisdom, they struggle for control of the islands. They anxiously await the cards handed to them by fate. But when the time is right, they move to capture one, two, or even more islands, trying to gain the upper hand. At the mercy of the magical powers of the South Seas, they quickly realize that even the best magic is no good without strategy.&quot;&#10;&#10;Originally published in 1997 as Arabana-Ikibiti by the designer's own publisher Bambus Spieleverlag, then reprinted by Funagain in the U.S., Kosmos' Kahuna &ndash; part of its Kosmos two-player series &ndash; is the best known implementation of this design.&#10;&#10;It's a two-player game, played on a board depicting twelve islands. Players use cards to place bridges between these islands or remove opponent's bridges. If you get the majority of bridges around an island, you place one of your marker stones on it and also remove any of your opponent's bridges to that island &ndash; which might cause them to lose a bridge majority on an adjacent island and lose a marker stone there.&#10;&#10;The game is played in three rounds. A round ends when all cards from the face down deck and the three face up cards have been taken. Then points are scored for the islands with a marker stone on them. The game can also end sooner when one player has absolutely NO bridges left on the board.&#10;&#10;The Kosmos edition has excellent graphics and nice wooden pieces and plays very well.&#10;&#10;Reimplements:&#10;&#10;     Arabana-Ikibiti&#10;&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;     Kanaloa&#10;&#10;&#10;";1998;6.6128;2.0542;2;2;40;10;Abstract Strategy;south seas kahuna ancient sorcerer pacific compete dominance archipelago consist small island magic wisdom struggle island anxiously await card hand fate time right capture island try gain upper hand mercy magical power south sea quickly realize good magic good strategy originally publish arabana ikibiti designer publisher bambus spieleverlag reprint funagain u kosmos kahuna ndash kosmos series ndash well know implementation depict island use card place bridge island remove opponent bridge majority bridge island place marker stone remove opponent bridge island ndash cause bridge majority adjacent island marker stone end card face deck face card take island marker stone end soon absolutely bridge leave kosmos excellent graphic nice wooden piece reimplement arabana ikibiti reimplemente kanaloa

398;Wildlife Safari;"Wildlife Safari was originally published by AMIGO as Flinke Pinke. This game is one of those 'painfully simple' Reiner Knizia games. There are five different colored chips, with six cards, zero through five, in each of the colors.  The cards are dealt out, and then players take turns playing a card and taking any available chip.  When one color has all six cards played on it, then the game is over, and players use the last card played in each category to value their chips.  The highest total value wins.&#10;&#10;Description of 1994 Milton Bradley re-issue Quandary, for 2-4 players:&#10;&#10;A game of placement, shares and nerve by Reiner Knizia, this is a lovely edition with nice, heavy tiles akin to Mah-jong pieces in weight and feel. Players in turn lay numbered pieces on tracks curling to the centre, and then take a share in any colour. The round ends when a track is filled. Scoring is based on your total share multiplied by the value of the final tile played on each track. So if you are collecting blue shares, I'll try and lay a blue 1 as near last as possible. Then you'll want to play a blue 5 to raise your possible score, but must take a share in a different colour. Same game, different production.&#10;&#10;Description of 2003 Fantasy Flight Games re-issue, Loco!, for 2-4 players:&#10;&#10;Here is the FOURTH version of the game that was originally Flinke Pinke only this time, the added &quot;rule&quot; is that whenever you play a card with a value of &quot;0&quot;, you must say &quot;Loco!&quot; aloud or forfeit your opportunity to select one of the colored chips.  Apart from that, the game is identical.&#10;&#10;Description of the 2010 Eagle-Gryphon Games games re-issue, Botswana, for 2-5 players:&#10;&#10;This fifth version of the game adds a safari theme. Rules and gameplay are unchanged from the original version (no rules about animal noises), but the chips are replaced by plastic animal figures and the cards are covered in matching animal fur patterns.

Each turn, players select a card from 2 to 10, which is the number of spaces they're moving. After these are revealed remembering that players cannot duplicate a card played by someone previous, players move forward down the road. Each of the cards allows for a certain number of road tile placements from your supply, a number of maneuvers per turn, and the damage your current speed will inflict should you careen into another car. Additionally, a percent of the tiles have special actions associated with them, which give the car on them the ability to jump, or hit a semi-truck, or skid out of control, or just plain slow down 'cuz there's a Smokey comin' on his flipside... The game is over when a car reaches the edge of the table, which gives the game a variable ending.

416;A to Z;"Each player receives a plastic board with 25 spaces on it labeled A to Z (with X and Y sharing a space). The playing board has spaces marked 15, 30, hand and 2. Each player takes a turn moving the single pawn around the board. Once you land on a space, another player draws a card (each with 6 categories on them), looks up your die roll on that card and reads the corresponding category. If you landed on a 15 or 30 you have that many seconds to think of as many words in that category as you can and for each word you can come up with, you cover the appropriate space on your plastic board with a chip. The aim is to be first to fill all 25.&#10;&#10;If you land on a hand, you get 15 seconds and choose another player.

428;Galopp Royal;"While ostensibly a racing game - a &quot;racing your sedan chair around the gardens of Versailles&quot; game, no less - the heart of Galopp Royal is the auction rounds that precedes each race: a jumble of bluffing, bidding &amp; wild swings of luck.&#10;&#10;";1995;5.89918;1.6316;3;6;45;9;Dice, Racing;ostensibly racing race sedan chair garden versaille heart galopp royal auction precede race jumble bluff bid amp wild swing luck
430;Asterix: Das Kartenspiel;"The year is 50 B.C. Gaul is entirely occupied by the Romans. Well, not entirely... A simple card game themed on the famous comic graphic novels, with indomitable Gauls bashing unfortunate Romans. Players have a set of cards (Asterix, Obelix, Getafix, Cacofonix &amp; Vitalstatistix) numbered 1 to 10, each card having a different combination of 1-4 magic potions to act as a tie-break. A deck of 55 Roman soldiers, ranging from the cook to Crismus Bonus &amp; Julius himself, are competed for in turn. A scoring card is shown, players select their Gaul cards and show them together, highest wins the Roman and discards their winning card. The other players return their cards to their hands to fight again. There are also Pirate cards which reduce your winnings and Dogmatix cards which allow the players to draw from the deck and either keep the card themselves or pass it onto another player. The rank of the Roman increases your score, but combinations of the same rank are worth much more.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    The Gnumies &#10;&#10;&#10;";1990;5.97;1.1333;2;5;30;8;Bluffing, Card Game, Comic Book / Strip;year b c gaul entirely occupy romans entirely simple card famous comic graphic novel indomitable gauls bash unfortunate roman set card asterix obelix getafix cacofonix amp vitalstatistix number card have different combination magic potion act tie break deck roman soldier range cook crismus bonus amp julius compete card show select gaul card highest roman discard winning card return card hand fight pirate card reduce winning dogmatix card allow draw deck card pass rank roman increase combination rank worth implement gnumie
432;Take 5;"In 6 nimmt!, a.k.a. Category 5 and many other names, you want to score as few points as possible.&#10;&#10;To play the game, you shuffle the 104 number cards, lay out four cards face-up to start the four rows, then deal ten cards to each player. Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; specifically, each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that's below the card's number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in its row.&#10;&#10;In addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value. After finishing ten rounds, players tally their score and see whether the game ends. (Category 5 ends when a player has a score greater than 74, for example, while 6 nimmt! ends when someone tops 66.) When this happens, the player with the fewest points wins!&#10;&#10;6 nimmt! works with 2-10 players, and the dynamics of gameplay change the more players that you have. One variant for the game has you use 34 cards, 44 cards, 54 cards, etc. (instead of all 104 cards) when you have three, four, five, etc. players. This change allows you to know which cards are in play, thereby allowing you to track which cards have been played and (theoretically) make better choices as to which card to play when.&#10;&#10;";1994;6.97488;1.1915;2;10;45;8;Card Game, Number;nimmt k category name want possible shuffle number card lie card face start row deal card simultaneously choose reveal card hand add card row card place ascend order base number specifically card place row end high number card number sixth card place row owner card claim card sixth card card row addition number card value finish tally end category end great example nimmt end top happen few nimmt work dynamic change use card card card etc instead card etc change allow know card allow track card theoretically well card

436;Canyon;"Canyon is a trick-taking game in which players try to predict exactly how many tricks they will take.  The number of cards in a hand increases and then decreases in size.  A correct prediction gives your marker movement points around a scoring track depicted on a river in a canyon, whose main feature of interest is a section of &quot;rapids&quot; near the finish line where your marker will be &quot;caught in the current&quot; and sent back a few spaces if you go too many hands without a correct prediction.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Bid & Bluff&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Grand Canyon&#10;&#10;&#10;";1997;6.24934;1.5676;3;6;45;10;American West, Card Game, Racing;canyon trick taking try predict exactly trick number card hand increase decrease size correct prediction give marker track depict river canyon main interest section rapid near finish line marker catch current send space hand correct prediction implement bid bluff expand grand canyon

440;Zoff in Buffalo;"Once a year, Buffalo City goes beef crazy. Cowboys drive their cows here to the biggest auction in the Wild West. The players must attempt to find grazing for their cows on the limited pasture.&#10;&#10;Which beef baron will most cleverly play his cards?&#10;&#10;Players have 10 cards to play which specify a number of cows.  Each round features a simultaneous selection of 2 of the 10 cards and a designation of which of the several pastures (the number of pastures in the game depends on the number of players) you'll try to place the cows in.  The tricky part starts with the rule that no two players can ever have exactly the same number of cows in a given pasture.  So if you plan to put 4 cows in a certain pasture, but somebody else has exactly 4 there already when your turn comes around, you'll only get to put 3 of them in -- and if somebody else has exactly 3 there already, you'll only get to put 2 of them in.  And it's very detrimental to your gameplan if you don't get to play all the cows you're entitled to!&#10;&#10;When a pasture is completely filled with cows, there are bonuses paid in the form of a chance to put extra cows into other pastures, but perversely, the better bonuses go to the players with the second or third most cows, not the first most.  This is the *really* tricky part.&#10;&#10;The game ends after five swift rounds and all 10 of your cards played, maybe half an hour from start to finish. Whoever has the most cows in the pastures wins!&#10;&#10;";1998;6.37039;2.0323;2;5;45;12;American West, Farming;year buffalo city go beef crazy cowboy drive cow big auction wild west attempt find grazing cow limited pasture beef baron cleverly card card specify number cow simultaneous selection card designation pasture number pasture depend number ll try place cow tricky start exactly number cow give pasture plan cow certain pasture somebody exactly come ll somebody exactly ll detrimental gameplan don t cow entitle pasture completely fill cow bonus pay form chance extra cow pasture perversely well bonus second cow tricky end swift card maybe half hour start finish cow pasture
442;Um Reifenbreite;"Translating as &quot;By the Width of a Tire,&quot; this game covers a Tour de France-type of bicycle race.  Each player takes control of a four-member racing team, and the goal is to score as many points as possible for the whole team.  Movement is primarily handled by dice, however a limited card set partially replaces die results.  Once you add unique rules which allow riders to draft one another and multiple kinds of road surfaces, this game has much to offer race fans.&#10;&#10;Homas Tour is the original edition of the cycle racing game later known as Um Reifenbreite. Many copies of the original game were destroyed in a warehouse fire in 1979. The combination of its sudden rarity and recognition as a good game meant that Homas Tour was (and is) very desirable, particularly to collectors.

444;Escape from the Hidden Castle;"Although billed as a children's game, Escape from the Hidden Castle, a.k.a. Midnight Party or Hugo, is actually quite enjoyable by adults as a light, fun game. Each player controls a number of guests at a party, with the number of guests dependent on the number of players. These guests start the round in the spaces of the gallery on the game board, one guest per space; this initial placement is a large part of a player's strategy.&#10;&#10;The Phantom (or &quot;Hugo the ghost&quot; in earlier versions) starts in the cellar, then climbs the stairs towards the gallery where the guests circle. The mechanism for the Phantom's movement is simple: On a player's turn, he rolls a special die. If he gets a number, he moves his pieces; if he gets a Phantom, the Phantom moves. This means that with more players in the game, the Phantom moves a lot more frequently, so you must adjust your strategy accordingly.&#10;&#10;Once the Phantom has reached the gallery, the guests can start ducking into rooms adjoining the gallery to avoid him, with only one guest per room! A couple of rooms are special in that they add or subtract extra &quot;fright points&quot; from your score. As the Phantom catches up with the remaining guests, they are sequestered on the stair steps, then in the cellar. The first guest caught &quot;earns&quot; the most fright points, with those caught later in the round earning less and less.&#10;&#10;Once all the guests have been caught, the fright points are tallied. After playing a predetermined number of rounds, the player with the fewest fright points wins!&#10;&#10;";1989;6.23869;1.1314;2;8;30;8;Children's Game;bill child escape hidden castle k midnight party hugo actually enjoyable adult light fun number guest party number guest dependent number guest start space gallery guest space initial large strategy phantom hugo ghost early start cellar climb stair gallery guest circle mechanism phantom simple special die get number piece get phantom phantom mean phantom lot frequently adjust strategy accordingly phantom reach gallery guest start duck room adjoin gallery avoid guest room couple room special add subtract extra fright phantom catch remain guest sequester stair step cellar guest catch earn fright catch later earn guest catch fright tally predetermined number few fright
446;Avalanche;"Players take turns dropping their marbles down the channels of the game, trying to get as many marbles as possible to fall out the bottom.  Impeding the motion of the marbles are several plastic gates.  The gates catch the first marble that hits their top (subsequent marbles roll off) and swing back and forth when a marble hits their base.  Using logic, players deduce which way the gates will move when they drop their marble, and try to make a move that results in the most marbles making it to the bottom of the game (or that blocks a potentially good move by their opponent).&#10;&#10;";1965;5.6875;1.1923;2;6;30;8;Abstract Strategy, Action / Dexterity, Children's Game;drop marble channel try marble possible fall impede motion marble plastic gate gate catch marble hit subsequent marble swing forth marble hit base logic deduce way gate drop marble try result marble make block potentially good opponent

454;Tante Tarantel;"Tante Tarantel (Auntie Tarantula) scoots round her web, gobbling up your insects as they try to escape. The web is a spiral.  You roll the die to move Auntie, and then take turns to move one of your bugs towards the exit space. Initially, Auntie is in a good mood; if she runs into bugs, they go back to her larder. However, as soon as someone escapes, she loses her temper and kills anything she catches! The game has a scoring track.  Each time a bug is caught or escapes, a marker moves up the track, adding to the die roll and making Auntie run around the web faster and faster. Players can share some spaces, but often bump each other back and forth. Naturally, nasty bugs can push others into Auntie's path to certain death!&#10;&#10;The original set had wooden pawns for the bugs, but D&amp;F issued a series of neat rubber bugs, which add to the game's style.&#10;&#10;";1991;6.18107;1.2667;3;5;30;10;Animals, Children's Game;tante tarantel auntie tarantula scoot web gobble insect try escape web spiral die auntie bug exit space initially auntie good mood run bug larder soon escape temper kill catch track time bug catch escape marker track add die make auntie run web fast fast share space bump forth naturally nasty bug push auntie path certain death original set wooden pawn bug d amp f issue series neat rubber bug add style
458;Sherlock Holmes: The Card Game;"With illustrations from the original novels, this card game goes some way to evoke the feeling of the chase through Victorian London to unmask Moriarty and other villains. Players draw and lay cards in sequence, Movement, Location, Info, Action, Detectives and Villains. So I might take a train to the Country, find a clue and use a Disguise. I can use an Inspector, Arrest or Alibi card on my opponents and so on. Play ends either when an Arrest successfully reveals a Villain, or when a player discards their last card, a Villain, who Escapes.

460;Railway Rivals;"This is a classic simple railway racing game, perhaps the first modern railroading game, where you draw the railway lines on hex-board. This one uses the sort of colored marker pens you can wipe off with a damp cloth after the game. The game goes through phases; initially you draw tracks and earn money for linking cities. When a number of cities are joined, you start racing, the cities being chosen randomly. The races are simple dice-rollers and the 1st &amp; 2nd place get prize money. After a couple of races, you draw some more tracks, then race some more and so on.&#10;&#10;The railways cost more if you go over mountains etc, but this gives you shorter routes. You can run parallel to other lines at a cost, or simply link into another player's track and rent the tracks of other players when you race.&#10;&#10;The board has a UK map on one side and a US map on the other, both giving amusing challenges, and the game has good repeat value.

462;Esels-Rennen;"First issued in 1989 for fewer players, the second edition (released in 1996) is for 2-6 players. The board has two sides, for racing either 3 or 4 colored donkeys. Players are given a card secretly, each showing the donkey's finishing order, a different result for each card. The board shows a patchwork of steps across a field from start to finish, each space with a colored arrow matching the donkeys. When you move a donkey onto a space marked with a green arrow pointing left, you then move the green donkey one space that way. If that space then has a blue arrow pointing right, you next move the blue donkey on one space that way. This goes on until you cannot move the final donkey because it is blocked. Eventually, the donkeys cross the finish line, and the player with the best matching result on their card wins. More of a competitive puzzle than a game, it is a nice diversion, but awkward because the donkeys constantly fall on their sides.

The board is filled with checkerboard-style squares around the billabong in the middle.&#10;&#10;To start, everyone takes turns placing their five kangaroos on an empty square behind the stream that serves as the race's start &mdash; and finish &mdash; line. On your turn, you move one of your five kangaroos, usually moving it in a jump or series of jumps over the other kangaroos. Jumps can be long, but they must take a specific format; for example, if the kangaroo to be jumped over is five spaces away from your current location, your landing space must be five spaces beyond this kangaroo. You can jump over only one kangaroo at a time, but you can make multiple jumps on a turn as long as each jump is along a straight line (whether orthogonally or diagonally) and it does not pass over the billabong. Your other option &mdash; moving a kangaroo just one space &mdash; is usually used as a positioning tactic for a subsequent move.&#10;&#10;The first player to get all five kangaroos around the billabong and over the finish line wins.&#10;&#10;";1992;6.82834;1.8784;2;4;30;10;Abstract Strategy, Animals, Racing;geometrical racing billabong mdash currently available market billabong race mdash maneuver team kangaroo jump billabong dead end channel extend stream river term australia fill checkerboard style square billabong middle start take place kangaroo square stream serve race start mdash finish mdash line kangaroo usually jump series jump kangaroo jump long specific format example kangaroo jump space away current location landing space space kangaroo jump kangaroo time multiple jump long jump straight line orthogonally diagonally pass billabong option mdash kangaroo space mdash usually positioning tactic subsequent kangaroo billabong finish line
466;Inkognito;"Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;The goal of each agent in Inkognito is to complete a mission, together with his partner. At the beginning of the game, however, players don't know which mission they must fulfill!&#10;&#10;In the standard four-player game, each player guides one of four secret agents. The four characters are allied in pairs: Lord Fiddlebottom and Colonel Bubble are always partnered against Agent X and Madame Zsa Zsa. Each of the four agents is represented by one of four different figures, with different builds: tall, short, fat, thin. Only one of them represents the actual character controlled by a player. The other three figures represent spies which are friendly to him and that are trying to confuse the opposition.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player shakes the Phantom of Prophecy randomizer to determine his three available actions, e.g., moving on a land route or a sea route. The player moves his figures, trying to reach spaces already occupied by the other players' figures or the Ambassador. When&#31; figures are in the same space, the current player gets the right to &quot;ask questions&quot; and inspect some of the cards of that player. By deduction and a logical process of elimination, he can draw conclusions as to the identity and intentions of the other players.&#10;&#10;The &#31;first goal of every agent is to discover which of the other players is his partner. This partner has the other half of the &quot;code&quot; indicating his secret mission. After discovering (or thinking he has discovered) the real identity of the other players, an agent must trade his secret mission card with his ally. This will reveal the final mission and what must be done to complete it. If either agent on a team completes the mission, both he and his partner win the game.&#10;&#10;There is another character with an important role in the game: the Ambassador. He can be used to get clearer information about the other characters. Everyone wants to meet him because he is well-informed and can be useful to accomplish your purposes, but he can also help your rivals, so do everything you can to keep him far from them.&#10;&#10;The 2013 version of Inkognito from Ares Games raises the maximum player count to five by allowing someone to play the Ambassador and move it during his turn. He can still gather clues when the other players question the Ambassador during their turn, and the other players can still gather clues from him. The goal of the Ambassador's player is to know everything about the other characters, guessing their identities and builds. If the Ambassador achieves &quot;perfect knowledge&quot; before a team accomplishes its secret missions, he wins the game.&#10;&#10;";1988;6.60823;2.1652;3;5;90;10;Deduction, Spies / Secret Agents;description publisher agent inkognito complete mission partner beginning don t know mission fulfill standard guide secret agent character ally pair lord fiddlebottom colonel bubble partner agent x madame zsa zsa agent represent different figure different build tall short fat thin represent actual character figure represent spy friendly try confuse opposition shake phantom prophecy randomizer determine available action e g land route sea route figure try reach space occupy figure ambassador figure space current get right ask question inspect card deduction logical process elimination draw conclusion identity intention agent discover partner partner half code indicate secret mission discover think discover real identity agent trade secret mission card ally reveal final mission complete agent team complete mission partner character important role ambassador clear information character want meet informed useful accomplish purpose help rival far inkognito are raise maximum count allow ambassador gather clue question ambassador gather clue ambassador know character guess identity build ambassador achieve perfect knowledge team accomplish secret mission

470;Road to the White House;"extrapolated from the preview:&#10;&#10;The essence of the game is that you are moving from one to four pawns around the country, landing in cities, and scoring &quot;votes&quot; in the appropriate state which are proportional to the size of the city. Each turn, you move and add votes to the states you land in.&#10;&#10;There are many complications that can occur. You can sit out a turn and collect money. With money, you can buy &quot;organization&quot; in a state, acting as a multiplier to all subsequent votes you get in that state. You can buy &quot;advertising&quot; - most useful in buying votes in piddly states that you're too busy to visit. You can buy &quot;surrogates&quot; which are additional pawns who may travel, garnering votes, just like your candidate. You can buy &quot;special flights&quot; that help you get to places without the luck of the dice.&#10;&#10;The most characteristic part of the game comes in the &quot;issues&quot;. Each player picks a politician with his own profile on how he stands on various issues. Then either through choice or chance cards, issues become &quot;active&quot;. As long as the issue is active, politicians with a relevant stand will have bonuses or penalties when he visits certain states. The game strongly encourages role playing.&#10;&#10;The climax of the game comes at the end, as you go down each state to see who has the most votes, thereby winning that state's delegates. There is a smart balloting system, in which the lowest scoring player drops out, giving his states' votes to the next strongest in each state. This continues, with players dropping out in each successive ballot until a winner is chosen.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;";1992;6.16313;3.5455;3;6;240;12;Political;extrapolate preview essence pawn country land city vote appropriate state proportional size city add vote state land complication occur sit collect money money buy organization state act multipli subsequent vote state buy advertising useful buy vote piddly state busy visit buy surrogate additional pawn travel garner vote like candidate buy special flight help place luck dice characteristic come issue pick politician profile stand issue chance card issue active long issue active politician relevant stand bonus penalty visit certain state strongly encourage role climax come end state vote state delegate smart balloting low drop give state vote strong state continue drop successive ballot winner choose
472;DungeonQuest;"Players explore the ruins of Castle Dragonfire trying to reach the treasure chamber in the center of the dungeon and escape alive with as much treasure as possible. A limited number of turns before the game ends puts pressure on players to take risks and score rewards because anyone left in the dungeon when time runs out dies! A tile-laying system creates the maze-like dungeon and ensures that no two games are ever exactly the same.&#10;&#10;Originally published in Sweden as Drakborgen (Dragon Keep) in 1985 by Alga, a subsidiary of BRIO AB.

474;Cold War;"A game for four players, Cold War gives you command of the economic, military, and intelligence forces of one of the contemporary world's major powers, and dares you to seize political, military, and economic control of as much of the world as possible.  The only obstacles in your way are your three opponents, each of whom has a bag of dirty tricks to play and an equal stake in the world regions you claim for your own.

476;Mr. President;"Part of the 3M Bookshelf Series.&#10;&#10;Mr. President is a highly realistic reenactment of the campaign events which lead to the election of the President and Vice-President of the United States.  The two major political parties choose their candidates from a slate of possible nominees, each of whom possesses varying strengths and weaknesses. In their quest for victory, players feel the same frustrations and make the same decisions that confront actual candidates.  Strategies which were intended to sweep a party into office may suddenly require a drastic change of tactics.&#10;&#10;Mr. President includes Advanced Play rules covering Nominations, Advertising, Fund-Raising, Debates, and Incumbent Candidates.&#10;&#10;In the 2-player game, one player controls the President and Vice President of a party.&#10;&#10;In the 4-player game, two teams of candidates for President and Vice-President compete.&#10;&#10;The 1967 or later copyright date differentiates this version from the earlier 1965/1966 release by 3M, which is an entirely different game.&#10;&#10;NOTE:&#10;There are significant differences between the 1967 version and the 1971 version.&#10;&#10;";1967;6.64162;2.1613;2;4;60;12;Card Game, Political;m bookshelf series mr president highly realistic reenactment campaign event lead election president vice president united states major political party choose candidate slate possible nominee possess varying strength weakness quest feel frustration decision confront actual candidate strategy intend sweep party office suddenly require drastic change tactic mr president include advanced cover nomination advertising fund raise debate incumbent candidate president vice president party team candidate president vice president compete later copyright date differentiate early release m entirely different note significant difference
478;Citadels;"In Citadels, players take on new roles each round to represent characters they hire in order to help them acquire gold and erect buildings. The game ends at the close of a round in which a player erects his/her eighth building. Players then tally their points, and the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Players start with a number of building cards in their hand; buildings come in five colors, with the purple buildings typically having a special ability and the other colored buildings providing a benefit when you play particular characters. At the start of each round, the player who was king the previous round discards one of the eight character cards at random, chooses one, then passes the cards to the next player, etc. until each player has secretly chosen a character. Each character has a special ability, and the usefulness of any character depends upon your situation, and that of your opponents. The characters then carry out their actions in numerical order: the assassin eliminating another character for the round, the thief stealing all gold from another character, the wizard swapping building cards with another player, the warlord optionally destroys a building in play, and so on.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player earns two or more gold (or draws two building cards then discards one), then optionally constructs one building (or up to three if playing the architect this round). Buildings cost gold equal to the number of symbols on them, and each building is worth a certain number of points. In addition to points from buildings, at the end of the game a player scores bonus points for having eight buildings or buildings of all five colors.&#10;&#10;The expansion Citadels: The Dark City was initially released as a separate item, but the second edition of the game from Hans im Gl&uuml;ck (packaged in a tin box) and the third edition from Fantasy Flight Games included this expansion and can be recognized by its rectangular box (not square).

480;Age of Arguments;"The Age of Arguments is set at the end of the 17th and beginning of the 18th centuries.

484;Stratego Legends;"Stratego Legends takes the familiar game play of Stratego and expands it into something new. In addition to ranks, all pieces now have powers as well. Some fly, some teleport. Some perform better in the marshes or in the mountains. Others have powerful death curses that provide long-lasting effects to the battle. There are over 200 different pieces in the universe, each with its special function.&#10; Stratego Legends is an &quot;optionally collectible&quot; game. Each box comes with a light army and a dark army whose pieces have been chosen to work well together. However, there are rules for customizing armies (and the lands they fight upon) to specialize your attack force. There are also rules for multiplayer games where 4, 6, or 8 players can square off as two teams.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.81792;2.2642;2;8;60;8;Abstract Strategy, Bluffing, Collectible Components, Deduction, Fantasy, Memory;stratego legend take familiar stratego expand new addition rank piece power fly teleport perform well marsh mountain powerful death curse provide long last effect battle different piece universe special function stratego legend optionally collectible box come light army dark army piece choose work customize army land fight specialize attack force square team
486;Barnyard Buddies;"In Barnyard Buddies, a bunch of cards depicting various animals in different colors are placed faceup on the table. Each turn, one player reveals a card that depicts four animals, each in a different color. All players race to figure out the animal and color not depicted on this revealed card, then grab the card on the table showing this colored animal combination.&#10;&#10;This quick, mind-crushing exercise continues until the deck is depleted.

488;Stake Your Claim;"A gold rush themed set collection game with a simple mechanic that enables swift play. There are two variants described, a 2-6 player game as well as a 2-player version outlined in the rules.&#10;&#10;Broad appeal to children and adults due to the clear mechanics and straight-forward play.&#10;&#10;The game utilizes 44 cards in 11 groups of four different images. Players build up their 'stash piles' by 'patenting' as many 'claims' as possible. This is accomplished by collecting sets in multiple stacks by drawing from a draw pile or common pool of 8 tiles in the center of the table based on matches and placing tiles into the pool if no match can be found.&#10;&#10;Matches can also be made with the top card of piles of any other player. The end game comes when all cards are in the possession of the players, and the stacks are consolidated to determine who has the largest stack of claims.&#10;&#10;The 2-player variant involves repeat-dealing of four cards to players when their hands are exhausted by set collection from the pool until all cards from the deck have been utilized.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by: &#10;&#10;    R&#195;&#164;uber&#10;&#10;&#10;";1985;6.00141;1.0;2;6;15;6;Card Game;gold rush themed set simple enable swift describe outline broad appeal child adult clear straight forward utilize card group different image build stash pile patent claim possible accomplish collect set multiple draw draw pile common pool tile center table base match place tile pool match find match card pile end come card possession consolidate determine large claim involve repeat deal card hand exhaust set pool card deck utilize reimplemente r uber

492;Aladdin's Dragons;"After the immediate response to Richard Breese&#039;s Keydom at Essen 1999, Hans im Gl&#195;&#188;ck contracted to take the basic game idea and produce a version of the game.  Aladdin's Dragons, or Morgenland in the original German, is the product of their cooperation.&#10;&#10;The game features players putting numbered bidding chips face-down onto the board sequentially.  After the players have placed all of their chips, then each of the areas is resolved.  The bottom part of the board is where players attempt to gather treasure tokens, which is the overall currency of the game.  The middle part of the board features a number of special actions, which help the players cast spells, trade in their resource tokens, or block other players' actions.  The top part of the board is where players use treasure tokens to purchase artifacts, and the player who can collect the most artifacts by the end of the game will be the victor.&#10;&#10;Won Games Magazine Game of the Year award in 2001.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Keydom&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Aladdin's Dragons (card game version by same name as board game)&#10;&#10;&#10;Microbadges:    (Buy One)&#10;&#10;      Aladdin&#039;s Dragons fan&#10;&#10;&#10;";2000;6.88841;2.3596;3;5;90;10;Arabian, Bluffing, Fantasy, Medieval;immediate response richard breese keydom essen hans m gl ck contract basic idea produce aladdin dragon morgenland original german product cooperation put numbered bidding chip face sequentially place chip area resolve attempt gather treasure token overall currency middle number special action help cast spell trade resource token block action use treasure token purchase artifact collect artifact end victor games magazine year award implement keydom implement aladdin dragon card microbadge buy aladdin dragon fan
494;Ave Caesar;"Set in the Roman stadium Circus Maximus, in Ave Caesar, players use cards to move their chariots around a quasi-variable track. The track itself has bottlenecks and lane-changing restrictions, which make the race interesting for the racers (very similar to Detroit-Cleveland Grand Prix or Daytona 500). Players are required to race three laps, and they must stop to 'Hail Caesar' before they can finish (a pit stop). The game is light, but if you waste too many moves taking the longer, outside-routes on corners, you may not have enough movement to finish the race. Later, the game was revamped into Ausgebremst, with the most notable changes being modular boards and options to reduce the luck.&#10;&#10;The Cafe Games/Pro Ludo edition has only 2 different tracks compared to the Ravensburger edition with 2 track variants on both sides of the board.&#10;&#10;It was re-released in 2022 by DiceTree Games with deluxe components, new maps, and new variants (by the designer).&#10;&#10;";1989;6.64922;1.3588;2;6;30;12;Ancient, Miniatures, Racing;set roman stadium circus maximus ave caesar use card chariot quasi variable track track bottleneck lane change restriction race interesting racer similar detroit cleveland grand prix daytona require race lap stop hail caesar finish pit stop light waste take long outside route corner finish race later revamp ausgebremst notable change modular option reduce luck cafe games pro ludo different track compare ravensburger track side release dicetree deluxe component new map new designer
496;Dilemma;"Dilemma is a curious combination of speed, dexterity, and bluffing. The starting player places a numbered card in an arena (a plastic dish). Players place or apparently throw numbered cards into the arena. If you do this correctly so that your card covers the opener neatly, you then duel with the starter. You each have a dueling block, showing peace or war. Lay this hidden, then reveal them together:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Peace/peace means the players swap the cards in the arena.&#10;    War/peace means war takes all the cards but loses one of ten lives.&#10;    War/war means no one gains cards and both lose a life.&#10;&#10;&#10;If you have no lives, you still duel, but can place only peace.

500;MARK;"MARK is a game about collecting, processing, and reselling recycled components for a profit. Each turn, a player rolls a pair of color dice and chooses one of the showing die colors to perform an action with. Each color is tied to one type of recyclable material. A player can choose to receive a single new recyclable good to his delivery yard, or he can choose to move a single recyclable good from his delivery yard to his treatment area, or he can choose to sell one good from his treatment area to the market grid in the center of the board.&#10;&#10;The market grid has 5 rows, and each row can hold only one variety of recyclable materials. When selling to the market, if it is the first time that good has been sold, the player may choose which row to sell into (left-most position in the row only), otherwise he must sell into the next empty space in the row that variety already occupies. He receives the amount of money shown on the space where he places his recyclable good. When the row is full, all goods of that type are removed from the game. The game ends when four of the market rows are completely filled.&#10;&#10;If the player rolls both dice of the same color, he has no choice in which recyclable material to choose, but may perform two actions (delivery, treatment, or sale) with that type of good. In addition, there are two special symbols on the dice (one on each). One is a star symbol, which acts as a wild. The player can choose whatever color he desires. The other is a gavel, which triggers an immediate auction for the type of good shown on the other die, after which the player takes another turn. The auction is a closed-fist auction.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the player's turn, he must pay 5 dollars in storage fees if he has more than 2 recyclable materials in his delivery yard. He must also pay 5 dollars in storage fees if he has more than 2 recyclable materials in his treatment area. This provides tension between waiting for bigger pay-outs and selling recyclable materials early.&#10;&#10;The player with the most money at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;";1997;6.03226;1.6667;2;4;60;10;Economic;mark collect processing resell recycle component profit pair color dice choose showing die color perform action color tie recyclable material choose receive single new recyclable good delivery yard choose single recyclable good delivery yard treatment area choose sell good treatment area market grid center market grid row row hold variety recyclable material sell market time good sell choose row sell left position row sell space row variety occupy receive money show space place recyclable good row good remove end market row completely fill dice color recyclable material choose perform action delivery treatment sale good addition special symbol dice star symbol act wild choose color desire gavel trigger immediate auction good show die take auction closed fist auction beginning pay dollar storage fee recyclable material delivery yard pay dollar storage fee recyclable material treatment area provide tension wait big pay out sell recyclable material early money end

506;The Big Cheese;"An auction game in which players bid from their pool of &quot;worker rats&quot; to gain control of corporate projects.  The workers from the winning bid are then are assigned to the project.  Each turn, one worker is removed from each project.  A project is complete once all workers have been removed.  The value of a numbered project is only determined at completion by a die roll. Two other projects, Veto and The Big Cheese, allow special actions during the game. The game has two different scoring schemes, depending on whether players use a single six-sided die or a set of seven polyhedral dice.&#10;&#10;This is part of the Hip Pocket Games series.&#10;&#10;Awards&#10;&#10;1999 Listed in GAMES Magazine's GAMES 100&#10;&#10;";1998;5.8844;1.3455;3;6;30;10;Animals, Card Game, Print & Play;auction bid pool worker rat gain corporate project worker bid assign project worker remove project project complete worker remove value numbered project determined completion die project veto big cheese allow special action different scheme depend use single sided die set seven polyhedral dice hip pocket series award list magazine
508;Blue Max;"In &quot;Blue Max&quot;, each player pilots a World War I airplane in a dogfight. This  wargame can be played as a campaign, with new planes becoming available as time passes, and with surviving pilots getting better at what they do.&#10;&#10;Each plane has a maneuver sheet showing which ones it is allowed to do -- some maneuvers can only be executed by ace pilots, and other maneuvers are &quot;restricted&quot; in the sense that they can't be repeated from one turn to the next (the plane would stall).&#10;&#10;If you &quot;tail&quot; another plane, its pilot must show you whether he's going right, left or straight ahead. You get to shoot ahead of your plane, unless you have a bomber with an observer/gunner in the back (swivel-mounted guns). Damage is rolled on a table that determines severity in terms of blue and red hits; you then draw the indicated number of coloued chits from a cup. Hits are taken to the wings, tail, engine, etc. There's a chance the pilot is killed, or that the plane catches fire.&#10;&#10;Fuel eventually runs out and the pilots fly off to meet another day --if they survived. &#10;This is a lot of fun with massive numbers of players; you can put the 20-odd planes on the map at once, balancing the better airplanes with weaker pilots.&#10;&#10;The second edition introduced crude altitude rules, and in 1995 GDW put out full-blown miniatures rules.&#10;&#10;The 2014 edition of Blue Max had substantial changes, and can be found with its own game page HERE.&#10;&#10;";1983;7.17164;2.2673;2;6;60;13;Aviation / Flight, Wargame, World War I;blue max pilot world war airplane dogfight wargame campaign new plane available time pass survive pilot get well plane maneuver sheet showing one allow maneuver execute ace pilot maneuver restrict sense t repeat plane stall tail plane pilot go right left straight ahead shoot ahead plane bomber observer gunner swivel mount gun damage table determine severity term blue red hit draw indicate number coloue chit cup hit take wing tail engine etc chance pilot kill plane catch fire fuel eventually run pilot fly meet day survive lot fun massive number odd plane map balance well airplane weak pilot second introduce crude altitude gdw blow miniature blue max substantial change find page
510;Eschnapur;"Eschnapur is a game where players explore an Indian temple and try to discover the secret treasures hidden within.&#10;&#10;The game is a mixture of a variety of mechanisms; discovery chips, movement tiles, supply tiles and symbol cards. The game board shows a top-down view of the temple, showing a path through the temple off which are many niches holding the treasures. The pathway has stepping stones marked with a variety of symbols, one in front of each. To open the niche you must have the right symbol. To move around, you must spend footprint tiles. To obtain these, the player must reveal 2 supply tiles, keeps one and auctions the other. Players bid with anything they have, tiles, coins, cards.&#10;&#10;Sounds confusing? It is. You must win auctions to get the stuff you need to win more auctions and move and open niches and collect treasures to score points to win the game.  It might take a player a while to figure the true value of all of the items and how it all fits together, but once a player has the idea, the game really works.&#10;&#10;";2000;5.66924;2.3529;3;5;60;10;Exploration;eschnapur explore indian temple try discover secret treasure hide mixture variety mechanism discovery chip tile supply tile symbol card show view temple show path temple niche hold treasure pathway stepping stone mark variety symbol open niche right symbol spend footprint tile obtain reveal supply tile keep auction bid tile coin card sound confuse auction stuff need auction open niche collect treasure figure true value item fit idea work
512;Holiday!;"In this game, players attempt to guide an airplane around the world as the calendar progresses from day to day.  Players hold a hand of cards, each stating a city and day-of-the-week combination.  Their goal is to have the plane reach their destination as close to their card's day as possible.  (E.g. if I hold &quot;Paris - Tuesday&quot; then I'd like the plane to reach Paris on Tuesday, not on Saturday--it's worth more points that way).&#10;&#10;The method by which the plane moves is based on an auction.  Each round, players bid for the right to choose the plane's next destination (each player starts with a fixed amount of money and cannot earn any money during the game).  Movement is restricted to only adjacent cities.  Sometimes a player will receive a windfall when an opponent pays for the privilege of moving the plane but moves it to a place where it's beneficial to both players.  At other times, a player will see the plane start moving away from the area of the world preferred.&#10;&#10;Play continues until all players are out of money or one player has played all of his or her cards.  Most victory points earned (as the cards are played) determines the victor.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented as:&#10;&#10;    Shanghai&#10;    Maloney&#039;s Inheritance&#10;&#10;&#10;";1973;6.73872;2.0;2;8;40;8;Aviation / Flight, Travel;attempt guide airplane world calendar progress day day hold hand card state city day week combination plane reach destination close card day possible e g hold paris tuesday d like plane reach paris tuesday saturday worth way method plane base auction bid right choose plane destination start fix money earn money restrict adjacent city receive windfall opponent pay privilege plane place beneficial time plane start away area world prefer continue money card earn card determine victor implement shanghai maloney inheritance

518;Cat vs. Mouse;"Cat vs. Mouse lets players &quot;Recreate the classic cartoons you grew up with and pound on your friends at the same time!&quot;.&#10;&#10;The game is for 2-4 players and each player gets a &quot;team&quot; of 1 cat and 2 mice. The main object of the game is to get 10 points, mostly by having your mice get food from the refrigerator back into the mouse-hole. The board is the layout of a house with the mouse-hole on one end and the refrigerator on the other end. Your mice try to get food and your cat tries to stop the other team's mice from doing so. There is a dog counter which can be moved each turn, and you use it to try to go after the opponent's cat. In terms of fighting, you can only fight an enemy (The mouse's enemy is the cat, the dog's enemy is the cat, and the cat's enemies are the mice and the dog). You can also pick up items throughout the house that you can use during combat to modify your strength.

524;Desperados;"Desperados is a partnership game where players in teams of two must work together to get the most points. In Reiner Knizia&#039;s first published game, there are nine mine-opening cards and nine mine-closing cards.  To score any points you've got to play gold, silver or copper cards onto the corresponding open mine and then close it.  Trouble is, your opponents can close your mine before you want or even try to steal it with bandit cards -- a tough gauntlet to run, but here and there a few points trickle through and into the scoring column.  On your turn you either play a card OR draw a card -- not both -- making this rapid-fire card game move at its own special pace, which is very quickly indeed. It was designed primarily for partnership play, and appreciated best by players with good partnership skills. For players who do not want a partnership experience, there are variations for 2 or 3 players.&#10;&#10;Originally published as Digging by Hexagames in 1990 (Later by Avalanche Press with new pictures on the cards and a trivial rules tweak).

526;Abalone;"This beautiful and functional board has room for two teams of large marbles. Players take turns pushing the marbles around the board, with the goal of pushing six of the opposing player's marbles off the board. The central idea is that a column of marbles has weight given by the number of marbles in line. Someone will need to push with a heavier group of marbles in order to push the column along that axis. However, with six possible directions, it's difficult to defend yourself perfectly. Also, it's possible to play the game with up to six players when supplemental marble sets are purchased.&#10;&#10;A winner of the 1988 Concours International de Cr&#195;&#169;ateurs de Jeux de Soci&#195;&#169;t&#195;&#169;.&#10;&#10;";1987;6.47995;2.1559;2;2;30;7;Abstract Strategy;beautiful functional room team large marble push marble push oppose marble central idea column marble weight give number marble line need push heavy group marble order push column axis possible direction difficult defend perfectly possible supplemental marble set purchase winner concour international de cr ateurs de jeux de soci t
528;ZÃRTZ;"In Z&Egrave;RTZ, the third addition to the GIPF Project, players compete to acquire sets of multi-colored balls. This is mostly accomplished by jumping one ball over one or more others, Checkers-style, on a hex board. A player's turn consists of either jumping (which can be forced) or placing any color ball on the board and removing an empty space from the edge of the board. In this manner, the play space continually shrinks, giving the endgame an almost claustrophobic feel.&#10;&#10;This game is part of project GIPF.&#10;&#10;";1999;7.26878;2.7361;2;2;60;9;Abstract Strategy;z egrave rtz addition gipf project compete acquire set multi color ball accomplish jump ball checker style hex consist jumping force place color ball remove space edge manner space continually shrink give endgame claustrophobic feel project gipf

538;Manager;"Manager is a deceptively simple game of economics for up to six players. Each player is the manager of one of the six companies, which are supposed to be manufacturers competing in the same market with identical products. (It is strongly hinted that the products are computers.) The player is responsible for setting the sale price of his product, buying machines to automate production, and buying or selling stock in any of the six companies.&#10;&#10;The object of each round--usually--is to charge as much as you can for your product without charging too much more than everyone else. Every turn starts with the players secretly setting the price for their product. The person who has charged the least gets to sell. The one who has charged next-to-least also gets to sell--as long as his price wasn't more than 1,000 DM above the person below him. In fact, as long as there isn't a 1,000 DM gap between one player's price and the next, every player gets to sell. But any player who has charged over 1,000 DM more than his next-lowest competitor--and all players who charged more than him--gets locked out of the market.&#10;&#10;The prices on the stock market vary depending on who got to sell and who didn't. The companies that got shut out of the market lose ground. The companies that sold their product gain, with the one who got the highest price gaining the most.&#10;&#10;There is room for all kinds of maneuvering in the game. After the first few rounds, you make more money on the stock market than you do running your company, so you can actually drive your company into the ground--advancing someone else's company--and come out ahead.&#10;&#10;";1979;6.39816;2.5333;3;6;60;10;Economic;manager deceptively simple economic manager company suppose manufacturer compete market identical product strongly hint product computer responsible set sale price product buy machine automate production buying sell stock company object usually charge product charge start secretly set price product person charge get sell charge get sell long price wasn t dm person fact long isn t dm gap price get sell charge dm low competitor charge get lock market price stock market vary depend get sell didn t company get shut market ground company sell product gain get high price gain room kind maneuver money stock market run company actually drive company ground advance company come ahead

548;Buck Rogers: Battle for the 25th Century Game;"Fight for control of the twenty-fifth century Inner Solar System as imagined in the 1950s in this strategy game which is a close relative of Axis &amp; Allies. The map board's Solar System Display keeps track of the 4 inner planets (Mercury through Mars) and the 9 larger asteroids along their orbits. The rest of the board is taken up by the various territorial displays; the larger planets are subdivided, plus there is Deimos around Mars, the Moon, L-4 and L-5 around Earth and Mercury's two artificial satellites --for a total of 42 territories.&#10;&#10;Leader Characters each have special powers. Troopers represent the grunts --infantry workhorses and cannon fodder. &quot;Gennies&quot; are Genetically Engineered fighters; they are stronger than Troopers but cannot leave the planet for which they were designed. Transport ships carry troops and factories between planets. War ships come as Fighters and Battlers (i.e., Bombers). Killer Satellites play the role of air defense. Factories make all these pieces - although you do have a Black Market option.&#10;&#10;As the planets move through their orbits you must plan your own moves well in advance to exploit planetary conjunctions. The movement rules consider not only the ship movements in the planet's orbits, but also the respective revolutions of the planets around the sun, and allow players to plan some nice surprises when two planets are near one another, which usually happens only once or twice in the game.&#10;&#10;Upgraded by:&#10;&#10;    Buck Rogers 2.0&#10;&#10;&#10;";1988;6.48565;2.6757;2;6;120;10;Comic Book / Strip, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Science Fiction, Wargame;fight fifth century inner solar imagine strategy close relative axis amp ally map solar display keep track inner planet mercury mar large asteroid orbit rest take territorial display large planet subdivide plus deimo mar moon l l earth mercury artificial satellite total territory leader character special power trooper represent grunt infantry workhorse cannon fodder gennie genetically engineer fighter strong trooper leave planet transport ship carry troop factory planet war ship come fighter battler e bomber killer satellite role air defense factory piece black market option planet orbit plan advance exploit planetary conjunction consider ship planet orbit respective revolution planet sun allow plan nice surprise planet near usually happen twice upgrade buck roger
550;Barbarossa;"Barbarossa, in Italian &quot;red beard&quot; was, according to its inventor, inspired by Patricia McKillip's Riddle-Master fantasy trilogy (Die Schule der R&auml;tselmeister in the German translation), in which wizards are devoted to the creation of riddles and riddle solving tournaments. In an interview designer Klaus Teuber stated &quot;As you know there are moments when you close a book really sad that it's over. After finishing the last page, you often feel like you've lost a friend -- to be somewhat melodramatic. So I was looking for a way to keep the book alive a little longer. Creating a game seemed the perfect solution. In this game, I was looking for a way to make riddles, to experiment with shapes and to let the players express their own creativity with clay.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game starts with players using modeling clay to make objects that can be guessed by the other players. Players then take turns to move around the board either by rolling a die or spending gems to choose their move. The spaces landed on determine actions. Either the other players receive victory points, or you can ask a letter of an object (What's the fifth letter of that thing?), or you can ask general questions or make a single guess until you get a NO answer. Players also have three curse stones that they can throw down twice in the game and make a guess.&#10;&#10;You make a guess by writing the word down and passing it to the owner, who answers YES or NO. If you guess right, you stick an arrow in the object and score points (5pts if you're first, 3pts for second correct guess). In addition, and this matters, the object owner can either gain points or lose points, depending on the total arrows sticking at the time. So if you make your object too easy, or too hard, you lose points, but if you get it just right, you gain. Plus, at the game end, objects lacking arrows also lose their owners points.&#10;&#10;Your objects must each represent a single specific word, which you note down in secret. Trying to think of two or three things that people will guess, but not too easily, is really tricky and makes Barbarossa a fun game. Hopefully the new edition has a better rules set, as players might get puzzled by the variety of actions.&#10;&#10;A later-developed game directly inspired by Barbarossa is  Dominic Crapuchettes' Cluzzle.&#10;&#10;Re-published by Kosmos / Rio Grande 2001.&#10;&#10;Republished by Mayfair Games in 2005, in an edition for a maximum of 4 players in a smaller-sized box.&#10;&#10;";1988;6.32134;1.5524;3;4;60;12;Deduction, Fantasy, Humor, Party Game, Word Game;barbarossa italian red beard accord inventor inspire patricia mckillip riddle master fantasy trilogy die schule der r auml tselmeister german translation wizard devoted creation riddle riddle solve tournament interview designer klaus teuber state know moment close book sad finish page feel like ve friend somewhat melodramatic look way book alive little long create perfect solution look way riddle experiment shape let express creativity clay start modeling clay object guess die spend gem choose space land determine action receive ask letter object fifth letter thing ask general question single guess answer curse stone throw twice guess guess write word pass owner answer yes guess right stick arrow object pt pt second correct guess addition matter object owner gain depend total arrow stick time object easy hard right gain plus end object lack arrow owner object represent single specific word note secret try think thing people guess easily tricky make barbarossa fun hopefully new well set puzzle variety action later develop directly inspire barbarossa dominic crapuchette cluzzle publish kosmos rio grande republish mayfair maximum small sized box
552;Bus;"Prior to Essen 1999, a group of students created Splotter Spellen to sell some of their own game designs.  This game is regarded as one of the highlights of that group.  The object of the game is to deliver as many people to their destinations as you can.  To accomplish this, players place route markers on the board to connect passengers to their destinations.  However, the destination types (work, bar, home) vary from turn to turn, so you can follow certain passengers as they make their way through the daily grind.&#10;&#10;Players may buy more buses (they start off with one), build onto their bus route, bring new passengers to the city (via the trains), expand the city by adding more buildings, and run their buses. There is another option, the clock. The action board has one other clever feature. On some actions, route expansion and building, the first player to choose that action actually gets to execute the action last! Which leads to some interesting games of chicken and some painful decisions.&#10;&#10;Buying more buses allows a player to carry one more passenger every time they run their buses - hence scoring, in the best case, one more point. Depending on how the city gets built, however, finding lots of passengers on the street can be tricky.&#10;&#10;Bus routes extend from either end of a Settlers-style initial placement. Extensions are appended to either end. Routes may only run parallel if there are no empty streets at one of the ends or the line ends on the crossing as another player's end. All new passengers will arrive at one of two train stations so that is one concern when route building. One must also be careful to run by a nice mix of building types. And, when building, one must always have an eye towards spoiling other players' routes by placing a mix of building types at each of their intersection so that all of their passengers just walk! Finally, when carrying passengers, one wants to be careful to set up to carry the same passenger next turn.&#10;&#10;";1999;7.67038;3.0444;3;5;120;14;Transportation;prior essen group student create splotter spellen sell regard highlight group object deliver people destination accomplish place route marker connect passenger destination destination work bar home vary follow certain passenger way daily grind buy bus start build bus route bring new passenger city train expand city add building run bus option clock action clever action route build choose action actually get execute action lead interesting chicken painful decision buy bus allow carry passenger time run bus good case depend city get build find lot passenger street tricky bus route extend end settler style initial extension append end route run parallel street end line end crossing end new passenger arrive train station concern route build careful run nice mix building build eye spoil route place mix building intersection passenger walk finally carry passenger want careful set carry passenger

Additionally, structures can be built that give the city influence in one of three categories; superiority in one of these categories causes population to shift from other nearby cities when the &quot;Voice of the People&quot; is decided at the end of each turn.&#10;&#10;At the end of six turns, the player with the most points &mdash; which are distributed for well-rounded cities, well-fed populations, and the overall size of population &mdash; wins.&#10;&#10;Note: The correct pronunciation is like &quot;Cheetah&quot;, but with the accent on the last syllable: &quot;La Chee-TAH&quot;.&#10;&#10;";2000;7.01046;3.2688;2;5;120;12;City Building, Civilization, Renaissance, Territory Building;set italian countryside la citt agrave city state vie population start city charge expand different aspect city attract large population build farm feed people quarry finance marketplace allow growth city bathhouse people clean healthy additionally structure build city influence category superiority category cause population shift nearby city voice people decide end end mdash distribute rounded city feed population overall size population mdash note correct pronunciation like cheetah accent syllable la chee tah

The mission of each player is to scout the jungle and collect as many different animals as possible, for as many points. You turn over a face-down card on a grid of cards, and replace it with a card from your hand. The catch is that each row and each column may never have more than one of each animal.

Assembling the correct assortment of gems and assigning a silver dwarf to fulfill a contract, he can score either his own contract or one of two open contracts.

566;Wongar;"The board for this game features several square-ish areas, which each have their own draw pile.  Players each sequentially pick the top card which has the action they'd like to take.  These actions revolve around placing of control markers on the board.  There are three types of control markers that are available, and each type of marker will score each time the area is scored.  The areas are scored when either the Ancestor or the Elder tokens appear in the area, and moving either of the tokens gives the moving player the first-player status or extra scoring cards.  The scoring cards are the last element, as once an area is scored the players involved in the area use these cards to manipulate control makers in the general vicinity.  Scattered throughout the decks are scorpion cards, which ages the game to completion and increases the value of the scorings through the game.&#10;&#10;";2000;6.2873;2.9762;3;5;90;12;Prehistoric;square ish area draw pile sequentially pick card action d like action revolve place marker marker available marker time area area ancestor eld token appear area token give status extra card card element area involve area use card manipulate maker general vicinity scatter deck scorpion card age completion increase value
567;Quartier Latin;"from web page:&#10;&#10;You are the owner of a fancy bistro in the fashionable Quartier Latin in Paris, the most important investments are made: you have bought tables, chairs and tableware and have engaged fairly qualified personnel. Shortly before the opening of your pub the disaster happens. The competitors send hooligans to your premises that are about to destroy your work. You are determined to fight. Let 's hope that you have better cards than your opponents!&#10;&#10;Two teams of two or three players compete with the aim to open as many pubs as they can. But they not only try to set up their own enterprise but also to cancel the efforts of the other team by any means. For this purpose the teams can hire hooligans and bombers to threat the opponents. They can also cause other inconveniences like influenza for the personnel of the other team, pipe bursts or denial of credit. The other team can defend themselves with their own hooligans, managers or the two doormen Gaston and Gustave. Both, developing / opening of pubs and getting rid of the competitors, gain points. You have, for example, destroyed the other teams disco. Not only do the others not score points with their disco if you call a disco your own, their customers come to your premises (where else could they dance?)  and you collect MONEY (points)!! But even if you only have a simple beer garden, the bomb attack was useful for your business because the disco-dancers will visit the other pubs of the quarter if they don 't find their favorite disco, and yours is one of them.&#10;&#10;By the end of the game the most successful gastronome is obviously the one with the most points.&#10;&#10;";1997;5.5;0.0;4;6;45;0;Card Game, Fighting;web page owner fancy bistro fashionable quarti latin paris important investment buy table chair tableware engage fairly qualified personnel shortly opening pub disaster happen competitor send hooligan premise destroy work determined fight let hope well card opponent team compete aim open pub try set enterprise cancel effort team mean purpose team hire hooligan bomber threat opponent cause inconvenience like influenza personnel team pipe burst denial credit team defend hooligan manager doorman gaston gustave develop opening pub getting rid competitor gain example destroy team disco disco disco customer come premise dance collect money simple beer garden bomb attack useful business disco dancer visit pub quarter don t find favorite disco end successful gastronome obviously
568;Rage;"Based on the widely-known card game Oh Hell!, players use the deck of zero through fifteen in six suits to bid for a particular number of tricks and then subsequently take exactly that many.  Each game consists of ten hands, with the hand size shrinking by one each time, until the final one-card hand.  Along the way, trump is randomly determined and can be changed during the hand through the use of special cards.  There are also special cards that make the trump not count for a trick, others that can be declared any suit and value when played, and others that will give bonuses or penalties for taking the trick on which they're played.  A newer version of this game was released by Amigo in 2000.&#10;&#10;";1983;6.19618;1.471;2;10;45;8;Card Game;base widely know card oh hell use deck zero suit bid particular number trick subsequently exactly consist hand hand size shrink time final card hand way trump randomly determined change hand use special card special card trump count trick declare suit value bonus penalty take trick new release amigo

The object of the game is to move your little mountain climbing pawn through either one or two points, which are placed by your opponents.  You can only go up or down a certain number of levels in one step, and each hex only has three points from which to exit to the next hex.&#10;&#10;";1997;5.3125;1.6667;2;6;60;0;Racing;magnificent wooden hex cylinder vary size construct time surface end mountainous terrain use dice determine weather make efficient object little mountain climbing pawn place opponent certain number step hex exit hex

573;Grand Prix;"Extrapolated from Harrington description:&#10;&#10;Each player controls a team of 3 cars. On your turn you assign a movement of 6 to one car, 5 to another and 4 to the third car (on your next turn you may assign the movement allowances differently if you wish).&#10;&#10;To add a bit of racing flavor there is the option of slipstreaming (drafting). This is achieved by landing on a space marked with a chevron. If your car is directly behind another car then you may move an additional 3 spaces. If this takes you on to a space offering another slipstreaming opportunity (very rare!) then you may slipstream for a second time (but not a third).&#10;&#10;Grand Prix was also published in the compilations of Bertelsmann Buchclub in 1976 (see Jockey & Grand Prix),&#10;and in 1980 by Carlit as part of Spiele-Box .&#10;&#10;";1975;6.39091;1.3636;3;6;60;8;Abstract Strategy, Racing;extrapolate harrington description team car assign car car assign allowance differently wish add bit race flavor option slipstreame draft achieve land space mark chevron car directly car additional space take space offer slipstreame opportunity rare slipstream second time grand prix publish compilation bertelsmann buchclub jockey grand prix carlit spiele box
574;Devil Take the Hindmost;"In this clever racing game, cars move around a 30-space track on which the spaces are numbered from 1 to 10, then 1 to 10 again, then 1 to 10 for a third time.  The cards have different powers depending on which number your car is sitting on.  For instance, a card might move you 8 spaces if you're sitting on an 8, but only 3 spaces otherwise.  Cards go in and out of your hand at a rapid rate as you play and discard your way through a series of races, and card management skills will come in handy if you've got them.  Each race goes by quite quickly, but the game consists of a whole series of races -- 11 if you play with the full complement of 3 cars each for 4 players or 2 cars each for 6 -- the gimmick being that, at the end of each race, the car that came in last is removed from the game, and the next race has one fewer starters -- and so on until the game is down to the last two cars and the last race for the ultimate victory.&#10;&#10;Originally released as Devil takes the Hindmost which has the same mechanics but is a cycling-racing game.&#10;&#10;";1991;6.42339;1.5135;3;6;30;8;Card Game, Racing;clever racing car space track space number time card different power depend number car sit instance card space sit space card hand rapid rate discard way series race card management skill come handy ve get race go quickly consist series race complement car car gimmick end race car come remove race few starter car race ultimate originally release devil take hindmost cycling race

577;Parts Unknown;"Players are retail store owners who supply body parts to the local mad scientists. Viktor, a mad scientist, goes around window shopping. Whenever he stops to look at a particular type of parts, a demand for that type of part is created; all the parts at the cheapest price get sold. If there is still a demand, all the parts at the next cheapest price get sold. This continues until demand is met. If parts sold exceed demand, a surplus is created, which may put an extra townsfolk back into the population. If the demand is not met, a shortage is created which will be filled by removing a townsfolk.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players get a part from their gravediggers, and can pay for more parts. Players can buy store shelves, and stock those shelves with parts, setting them to a specific, fixed price. If parts don't sell. the may be shuffled off to the &quot;parts unknown&quot; pile, which will automatically sell at certain times at a highly discounted rate. There could be, at times, a monster on the loose which scares off shoppers, getting them to buy parts only at the cheapest price, ignoring other available parts. Also, villagers might riot, which causes parts from the gravediggers to be more expensive. Player with the most money at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Versions&#10;&#10;     1998 Cardstock version (Out of Print) &#10;&#10;&#10;Awards&#10;&#10;    Origins Award Nominee: Best Sci Fi/Fantasy Board Game&#10;&#10;&#10;";1999;6.01624;1.9048;4;10;90;10;Economic, Horror;retail store owner supply body part local mad scientist viktor mad scientist go window shopping stop look particular part demand create part cheap price sell demand part cheap price sell continue demand meet part sell exceed demand surplus create extra townsfolk population demand meet shortage create fill remove townsfolk gravedigger pay part buy store shelf stock shelf part set specific fix price part don t sell shuffle part unknown pile automatically sell certain time highly discount rate time monster loose scare shopper get buy part cheap price ignore available part villager riot cause part gravedigger expensive money end cardstock print award origin award nominee good sci fi fantasy

The Show-Off is dealt 9 cards, which must have no more than 3 of one suit (re-deal if he does have more than 3 of one suit). Once the dealer has settled his hand, nine cards are dealt to the other players.&#10;&#10;Three rounds ensue... the Show Off plays 3 cards (must be different suits) and (in game theme terms) challenges the other players to out-do him with their stuff. Players play 3 cards from their hand and must do one of 3 things to &quot;keep up with the Joneses&quot;: &#10;1. play 2 cards which match in suit, of which one of those cards are higher in rank (3rd card does not have to match)&#10;&#10;2. play 3 cards which do not match suits AT ALL, which the total value is higher than the Show-Off's 3 cards)&#10;&#10;3. play 3 cards which all match in suit, regardless of value&#10;&#10;Once we've determined if any players have &quot;kept up&quot;, we throw out all the cards played and the Show-Off lays down another 3 cards (from his now 6 card hand).

Kind of a cross between Britannia and Civilization, players play a series of tribes that flow through the region.  The aim of the game is to gain the most cultural advances by creating as much stability in a region as possible.&#10;&#10;Huns, Romans, and Germans by Gerhard H. Kuhlmann follows a similar theme although the game is broken down into basic and advanced rules and scenarios.&#10;&#10;The game comes with wood tokens as the playing pieces.  Detailed stickers are applied to the tokens to represent various types of units.  A deck of cards also accompanies the game which drives the invasions and advancements.

586;Up Front;"Only once in a great while does a game dare to be truly different and abandon old concepts while striking out to chart virgin territory in game design. Rarer still are the instances in which these games succeed in presenting a simulation of unparalleled realism in an easily comprehended and playable format. In UP FRONT, we have just such a game. Gone are the hexes and charts of conventional wargames; replaced by innovative and attractive game components which have distilled a wealth of technical data into one of the most playable, yet detail laden formats ever devised.&#10;&#10;UP FRONT is a game of man-to-man infantry combat set in WWII Europe. In many ways, the game is more realistic than SQUAD LEADER principles in that its inherent mechanics simulate the fear and confusion of the battlefield and the inability of leadership to assert itself far better than any tactical combat game yet published. There is no playing board; it has been replaced by Terrain cards which become the &ldquo;hexagons&rdquo; of the game as players maneuver their forces via Action cards over constantly changing terrain. The scale of the game is measured in terms of relative ranges between opposing forces, with most combat occurring within a scale distance of 500 meters during the course of player turns measured in varying seconds of actual time.&#10;&#10;UP FRONT is a game player&rsquo;s game, rich in detail yet easily playable within the space of a lunch hour. However, it also contains engrossing Multi-Player and Campaign Game versions which could last a week or more. Like SQUAD LEADER, UP FRONT is an open-ended game capable of depicting endless Design-Your-Own variations of small unit actions between American, German and Russian combatants. Tanks, Assault Guns, Smoke, Anti-Tank Rifles, Demolition Charges, Pillboxes, Partisans, SS, Entrenchments, Anti-Tank Mines, Infantry Guns, Flamethrowers, Armoured Cars, Halftracks, Panzerfausts, Bazookas, Panzerschrecks, Wire, Ambushes, Radios, Artillery, Minefields, Mortars, Snipers, Starshells, Heroes, Prisoners and Fords are all accounted for. In fact, UP FRONT encompasses almost everything that the SQUAD LEADER game system has taken four gamettes to do, and does so in a far more playable format. The game can be summed up in four words: Innovation, playability, detail and realism. That&rsquo;s an unbeatable combination.&#10;&#10;&#10;UP FRONT is rated 4 on the Avalon Hill Complexity scale of 1 (easy) to 10 (difficult).&#10;&#10;Recommended for two or more discriminating players of skill, ages 12 &amp; up.&#10;&#10;Each game includes: &#10;&#10;     162 full-colour, quality 2&frac14;&quot; &times; 3 &frac12;&quot; playing cards&#10;     120 full-colour 2&quot; &times; 2.6&quot; infantry cards&#10;     40 full-colour 2.3&quot; &times; 3.1&quot; AFV cards (maybe 39 cards?

587;Sumera;"This abstract includes 120 wooden squares, twelve wooden houses and thirty-two human&#10;figures in four colors for a game which is simultaneously about competition and cooperation.&#10;&#10;At the start there is a deserted, connected and fruitful land. You begin on a square of your choice and expand your territory by building on top of foreign tiles, skilfully placing your people, making useful marriages and attacking figures that get in your way.&#10;&#10;The victory formula is the number of tiles (of your colour) that are connected to your huts plus the number of your unmarried people on the board, all multiplied by the number of marriages you have concluded. &#10;Your aim is therefore to own a large territory and to make as many marriages as possible. If you do this better than the others, you become the monarch of Sumera.&#10;&#10;Credits state:&#10;&quot;With ideas from Frank Schaubrenner, Meersburg.&#10;An earlier version,The Walls of Babylon, contained a mechanism related to that of Wolfgang Kramer's Burgenland/Terra Turrium, and was shown in G&ouml;ttingen in 1987 and published&#10;by Witt Spiele at Essen in 1989.&quot;&#10;&#10;";1999;6.23966;2.6667;2;4;30;0;Abstract Strategy;abstract include wooden square wooden house thirty human figure color simultaneously competition cooperation start desert connected fruitful land begin square expand territory build foreign tile skilfully place people make useful marriage attack figure way formula number tile colour connect hut plus number unmarried people multiply number marriage conclude aim large territory marriage possible well monarch sumera credit state idea frank schaubrenn meersburg early wall babylon contain mechanism relate wolfgang kramer burgenland terra turrium show g ouml ttingen publish witt spiele essen

592;Spades;"This trick-taking game is a standard deck playing card game and takes on many different group-specific rules.  Generally speaking, each player is given thirteen cards and a partner who sits across the table.  Each player bids the number of tricks they'll take, and then the partners collectively attempt to take at least as many as they bid.  The tricks are fairly standard with following suit if you can, and spades as the trump suit.  If you make your bid you earn ten times the number of tricks you bid, otherwise you lose that many points.

593;Favoriten;"Favoriten is a simple betting/race game with a nifty element of press-your-luck thrown in.&#10;&#10;Five horses are involved in each of three races.  Players do not own any horse.  Rather, they each have three betting chips.  On a player's turn, she/he rolls a die and moves one of the five horses forward based on the result of the roll.  The race track pictured on the board has two lanes.  These lanes are used by the player to keep track of which horses have been moved in the current turn. At the start of a turn all of the horses shall be in the same lane. Then as a player moves the horses forward, he/she also moves them to the other lane. The player continues until they've rolled five times and moved each horse once.  The lane from where the horses started the turn will be empty.&#10;&#10;That's simple enough.  But before each turn, players are allowed to place a bet on a horse (starting with the rolling player).  After a person places a bet (e.g. &quot;I'll back the green horse&quot;) the next player can choose to or not to place a bet.  This continues until all players decline to place a betting chip.  Then the player starts rolling and moving horses.&#10;&#10;Eventually, three horses will cross the finish line and will pay out for win, place, or show positions.  The player who first placed a bet on the winning horse claims the greatest payoff.  Payoffs diminish the longer a player waited to support a horse (e.g. the second person to bet on the horse that ultimately wins pays less than the first player to back the second-place horse).&#10;&#10;The constant wait-and-see is agonizing.  If you back an unpopular horse, you'll watch it lag behind.  If you wait until everyone else is pushing a particular horse, you gain very little for joining the bandwagon late in the game.&#10;&#10;";1989;6.41249;1.3333;2;5;60;9;Racing;favoriten simple bet race nifty element press luck throw horse involve race horse bet chip die horse forward base result race track picture lane lane track horse current start horse shall lane horse forward lane continue ve time horse lane horse start simple allow place bet horse start person place bet e g ll green horse choose place bet continue decline place bet chip starts horse eventually horse cross finish line pay place position place bet horse claim great payoff payoff diminish long wait support horse e g second person bet horse ultimately pay second place horse constant wait agonize unpopular horse ll watch lag wait push particular horse gain little join bandwagon late
594;Sleuth;"In Sleuth, a classic deduction game from master designer Sid Sackson originally released as part of the 3M Gamette Series, players are searching for a hidden gem, one of 36 gem cards hidden before the start of the game. The remainder of this gem deck &ndash; with each card showing 1-3 diamonds, pearls or opals in one of four colors &ndash; is distributed evenly among the players, with any remaining cards laid face up. Thus, you and everyone else starts with some information about what's not missing.&#10;&#10;A second deck contains 54 search cards, each showing one or two elements, such as diamonds, pairs, blue opals, red pearls, or an element of your choice. Each player receives four face-up search cards; on a turn, you choose one of those cards and ask an opponent how many gem cards they have of the type shown. If you ask for, say, pairs, the player must tell you how many pairs they hold but not which specific pairs; if you ask for something more specific, say, red diamonds, the player reveals to everyone how many such cards she holds while you get to look at them in secret.&#10;&#10;Players track information on a score pad. You can guess the hidden gem at any time, or on your turn you can ask any one question regardless of which search cards you have, then immediately make a guess by marking your sheet and checking the hidden gem card. If you're wrong, you keep playing but can only answer questions; if you're correct, you win.&#10;&#10;The simplicity of the rules and the cards belies the complexity of the game. In some cases you see cards, while in others you hear only the number of cards that an opponent holds, making it tough to deduce.

Each and every one strives only for the opportunity to dethrone the Sultan and grasp the power for himself.&#10;&#10;To reach this goal each player must send his vizirs to the remote cities at the outskirts of the Realm, in order to acquire troops, weapon and bribes (in form of Power cards). Being absent unfortunately reduces the vizir's influence and importance at court and makes him an easy target for intrigues, and suspicions of betrayal can quickly lead to the dungeons - or to the Island of Banishing disappearing forever. Therefore a Vizir should not leave court for longer periods of time, and on his return should he always seek out the best place - such as one carrying a large number of votes (the seat-number).&#10;&#10;Only the player who is capable of balancing the various facets of the game - and most intelligently maneuvers his vizirs - will have a chance to win the struggle for subversion in the palace.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.02339;2.4;4;4;60;12;Arabian, Political;omnipotent sultan magnificent throne room dignified sit throne surround loyal devoted vizir loyal devote way strive opportunity dethrone sultan grasp power reach send vizir remote city outskirt realm order acquire troop weapon bribe form power card absent unfortunately reduce vizir influence importance court make easy target intrigue suspicion betrayal quickly lead dungeon island banish disappear forever vizir leave court long period time return seek good place carry large number vote seat number capable balance facet intelligently maneuver vizir chance struggle subversion palace

606;Pico 2;"from game review:&#10;&#10;The  game is composed of 11 cards. These are numbered 4 through 13 plus 16 and each also bears a number of &quot;pips&quot;. (From one on the 4 card to four on the 16 card.) A round is played as follows: each player is dealt 5 cards with the eleventh card discarded face-up. (Note that this means that you know exactly what cards your opponent holds.) Each turn both you and your opponent secretly select one of their respective cards and reveal them simultaneously. The higher card wins and that player sets that card aside scoring the number of pips on it. The loser retains his/her played card. However, if the higher card is more than twice the lower card then it's the lower card that is placed aside and scored. So the 13 will beat the 10 but lose to the 6. Play continues until one player is left with but a single card. Points are then scored and, here's the clever bit, players swap hands and do it again. This ensures that each game is exactly fair as both players will have equal opportunity to play a strong/weak hand. After these two rounds the points are totaled and a winner declared. There are, at most, fourteen card plays in a game and so the game is usually over in two or three minutes.&#10;&#10;";1997;5.89653;1.1515;2;2;5;10;Animals, Card Game;review compose card number plus bear number pip card card follow deal card eleventh card discard face note mean know exactly card opponent hold opponent secretly select respective card reveal simultaneously high card set card aside number pip loser retain card high card twice low card low card place aside beat continue leave single card clever bit swap hand ensure exactly fair equal opportunity strong weak hand total winner declare fourteen card usually minute
607;Honor of the Samurai;"from the review:&#10;&#10;This card game recreates the atmosphere of the Sengoku era in Japan's history: the struggle among the feudal lords (Daimyos) to install a strong and legitimate Shogun. To install themselves as Shogun, that is.&#10;&#10;Every player takes the role of one family of Samurai and the Daimyo they serve. They use honorable weddings, weapons, cultural sponsorship and military power to increase the honor of the family (and attack each other) until one of them reaches a previously stipulated amount of honor.

608;Siesta;"This abstract boardgame is made completely of wood and is quite beautiful.  The object of the game is to score the most points before one of the types of pieces are all gone.  There are Roofs in each of the players' colors, which are used to score points when they cast a Shadow.  A Sun token is placed next to a Roof and will score the Roof's owner points for each Shadow placed on the other side.  The Shadows score points for the Roof's owner, and can be scored multiple times if surrounded by multiple Roof/Sun combinations.  Each turn, a player places three pieces in any combination, but must score at least one point per turn.  The game ends when one player plays his last Roof or the last Sun or Shadow is played.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.3504;2.52;2;4;70;10;Abstract Strategy;abstract boardgame completely wood beautiful object piece go roof color cast shadow sun token place roof roof owner shadow place shadow roof owner multiple time surround multiple roof sun combination place piece combination end roof sun shadow
609;Ferkelei;"Players do essentially two things in Ferkelei: Shift their portfolios of stock in show pigs, and play cards to award prize money to pigs (or cause them to lose money or not to win). Many stock-based games have these features, but this game has a significant bandwagon effect. As one color of pig became active, many players would accumulate its stock, and the stockholders would naturally do things that helped each other, without forming explicit alliances. Then the color would play out, or other players would quash it or play the negative pig, and the game would move on to another color. The effect is like successive waves of popularity being washed out or dashed.&#10;&#10;More about the mechanics for those who are interested: On each turn, the player may exchange one stock chip for another or buy one. (At the start, nobody has cash to buy, so they only have their initial two chips available for exchange.) Then the player plays as many cards of one color as they like (from zero to five, except zero is not allowed if one has five or the draw pile is empty). Playing the cards can cover up competing pigs and/or bring one's favored pig to the fore, awarding it prizes depending on how far it has reached and how many times it appears on the board.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Merchants, with a number of changes&#10;&#10;&#10;";1995;5.67241;1.6667;2;5;45;8;Animals;essentially thing ferkelei shift portfolio stock pig card award prize money pig cause money stock base significant bandwagon effect color pig active accumulate stock stockholder naturally thing help form explicit alliance color quash negative pig color effect like successive wave popularity wash dash interested exchange stock chip buy start cash buy initial chip available exchange card color like zero zero allow draw pile card cover compete pig bring favor pig fore award prize depend far reach time appear implement merchant number change
610;Knights of the Rainbow;"Knights of the Rainbow is from FX Schmid USA. The box rates the game for 2-6, the rules rate it for 2-4, and the body of the rules refer to a maximum of five players. It is recommended that players stay within the 2-4 range, where 3 players seems ideal, otherwise the benefits of the honor cards (see below) are far too strong.&#10;&#10;Players start with seven strength, two gold, and no cards. On each turn a player can flip one, two, or three cards from the deck, keeping one of them and discarding the rest. All of a player&rsquo;s cards are kept face-up, stacked by type so everyone can see them.&#10;&#10;Players win by knocking out all opponents or having the highest score after three passes through the deck. Most of the cards are distributed among five color-coded types: strength, force, gold, magic, and honor. The player with the most cards of each type gains an advantage, usually at the start of his turn. The simplest of these increase a player&rsquo;s strength or gold, or decrease other players&rsquo; strength. The leader in magic can trade any of his cards for any card from the discard pile, or sacrifice any one of his own cards to destroy an opponent&rsquo;s card.&#10;&#10;Honor works differently. Shuffled into the deck are four &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Favor&rdquo; cards. When one of these is turned up, the player with the most honor gets two gold, two strength, or the top card from the deck. Misfortune cards are the dark side of the same coin, forcing loss of gold, strength, or cards from all players. Many cards bear a rainbow icon, however, and the player showing the most rainbows at the top of their stacks is protected from Misfortune.&#10;&#10;A player can spend gold at the end of his turn to buy another card from the deck, decrease an opponent&rsquo;s strength, or trade cards with an opponent. A player losing his last strength is knocked out of the game. Anyone who survives to the third appearance of the Long Live the King card (which triggers a reshuffle) scores a point for each magic card, strength, and gold they have. The highest total wins.&#10;&#10;";1999;4.95072;1.1667;2;6;45;10;Card Game, Wargame;knight rainbow fx schmid usa box rate rate body refer maximum recommend stay range ideal benefit honor card far strong start seven strength gold card card deck keep discard rest rsquo card keep face knock opponent have high pass deck card distribute color code strength force gold magic honor card gain advantage usually start simple increase rsquo strength gold decrease rsquo strength leader magic trade card card discard pile sacrifice card destroy opponent rsquo card honor work differently shuffle deck ldquo king rsquo favor rdquo card honor get gold strength card deck misfortune card dark coin force loss gold strength card card bear rainbow icon show rainbow protect misfortune spend gold end buy card deck decrease opponent rsquo strength trade card opponent strength knock survive appearance long live king card trigger reshuffle magic card strength gold high total
611;Ironman Football;"Ironman Football is a team management game based on gridiron football in the early 1920's. That was a time when there were no TV million$, no real passing game as they played with a squashed medicine ball, shoulder padding was a sturdy arrant jumper, helmets were strictly optional and you were expected to play on both offense and defense.&#10;&#10;The game features such notable institutions as the Pottsville Maroons, the Dayton Triangles and the Frankford Yellowjackets, and mega stars like Red Grange, George Halas, Jim Thorpe and Paul Robeson.&#10;        &#10;The game works on the old system of pulling a team together, playing a series of games, whacking down some event cards and trying to obtain the best record to win the league.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game you are handed some event cards, a league franchise, a team name and, unless you are very unlucky, a handful of star players. You also get some money.   Your core players, the poor faceless grunts in the trenches, are abstracted into a simple team rating and a total salary bill (excellent idea) but the star players, the backs and ends, are each given their own individual card. As team manager, it is your job to balance the huge benefits of having these talented individuals on your staff with the interestingly high salaries they demand for performance.&#10;&#10;The three key areas of offense, defense and special teams can all be enhanced by the star cards.&#10;&#10;In addition to the player-controlled teams, who will usually play each other twice, the game also supplies a range of 'autopilot' opponents. There are league teams who are often as good, or even better, than the players' lineups and also sandlot teams.&#10;&#10;Event cards add a lot to almost any the game. They can be played either before your weekly scheduled game or during the game itself. Their effects are wide ranging; from new gadget plays that can give you an extra dice on offense, to sponsorship deals that enable you to sell out to local government for big money. There are college players, fan loyalty, rain insurance, scams, scandals, intrigue and even subtle stuff like players' agents, loyalty and defections.&#10;&#10;Once you have played the game, you work out the gate receipts, which are divided between the home team and the visitors based on a pre-agreed percentage split. There are variables such as number of star players on show, rain, home opener, whether you are playing a winning team, etc. As it is more profitable to be at home (no travel expenses) and to play the winning teams with the most star players, each team has an inherent draw factor - remember this is pre-TV - and can negotiate and earn high income accordingly. Want to play the top rated Canton Bulldogs (8-0-2, three star players) at home? You are going to have to offer their boss a healthy enticement to come to Oolong and perform against your 0-5 Indians, just to earn some money to pay off your overdraft.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, having pocketed your share of the take, you must pay all the players their salaries and if you can't meet the payroll, you will start to lose staff. They may stay on out of the goodness of their hearts, but you also need to apply to the league for a stay of financial execution and avoid bankruptcy. All this links into the league structure. If you have any sort of claim against your opponent you may appeal and have your rival reprimanded or fined, and always at the back of your mind is simply surviving game to game. You must maintain a winning record, you need to find new players to satisfy the butcher's bill of game injuries and, if you survive all that and play nine games well, you'll get a shot at the league title. Interestingly, the game can be won by other means than just having the best record. The team with the most money also gets a point, and a winning season will accrue another. It is unlikely that with a title win you'll lose, but there will be teams close on your tail.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.37766;2.25;2;8;180;10;Sports;ironman football team management base gridiron football early time tv million real passing squashed medicine ball shoulder padding sturdy arrant jumper helmet strictly optional expect offense defense notable institution pottsville maroon dayton triangle frankford yellowjacket mega star like red grange george halas jim thorpe paul robeson work old pull team series whack event card try obtain good record league start hand event card league franchise team unlucky handful star money core poor faceless grunt trench abstract simple team rating total salary bill excellent idea star back end give individual card team manager job balance huge benefit have talented individual staff interestingly high salary demand performance key area offense defense special team enhance star card addition team usually twice supply range autopilot opponent league team good well lineup sandlot team event card add lot weekly schedule effect wide range new gadget extra dice offense sponsorship deal enable sell local government big money college fan loyalty rain insurance scam scandal intrigue subtle stuff like agent loyalty defection work gate receipt divide home team visitor base pre agree percentage split variable number star rain home opener team etc profitable home travel expense team star team inherent draw factor remember pre tv negotiate earn high income accordingly want rate canton bulldog star home go offer boss healthy enticement come oolong perform indians earn money pay overdraft end having pocket share pay salary t meet payroll start staff stay goodness heart need apply league stay financial execution avoid bankruptcy link league structure sort claim opponent appeal rival reprimand fine mind simply survive maintain winning record need find new satisfy butcher bill injury survive ll shot league title interestingly mean have good record team money get season accrue unlikely title ll team close tail

You have to keep placing blocks until either the seesaw tips or the stack you are building collapses.  If you tip the seesaw and then blocks fall off, those blocks are given to your opponent. However, if the stack collapses before the seesaw tips, then you get stuck with any blocks that fall onto the table.&#10;&#10;In either case, any blocks that stay on the seesaw are left there to complicate future turns.&#10;&#10;Steady hands and a little knowledge of physics helps.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.95435;1.0;2;2;30;5;Action / Dexterity;balance place wooden block wooden seesaw try tip start wooden block try rid block block come different size size different color place block single high seesaw place block seesaw tip build collapse tip seesaw block fall block give opponent collapse seesaw tip stick block fall table case block stay seesaw leave complicate future steady hand little knowledge physics help

Players take turns placing pieces on the board, trying to make a specified pattern in his color but not his opponent's -- all the while having to play both his color and his opponent's color each turn.  There are several different games explained in the rules: make 3, 4, or 5 in a row (in 3D) before your opponent, form a square in your color, form more three-in-a-row alignments than your opponent, etc.&#10;&#10;Eight games are:&#10;Game 1: 3D tic Tac Toe or 2 in a Box&#10;Game 2: Move 3 in a Row&#10;Game 3: 3D Four Square&#10;Game 4: &quot;3D tic Tac Toe or 4 in a Row&#10;Game 5: Variation on &quot;3D tic Tac Toe or 4 in a Row&quot;&#10;Game 6: Binary Doodle&#10;Game 7: 4-Square on the Level&#10;Game 8: Recluse Puzzle&#10;&#10;";1968;5.5;2.0;2;2;15;0;Abstract Strategy;include playing x grid piece piece consist cube marble center red green place piece try specify pattern color opponent have color opponent color different explain row d opponent form square color form row alignment opponent etc d tic tac toe box row d square d tic tac toe row variation d tic tac toe row binary doodle square recluse puzzle
616;What's That on My Head?;"What's that on my head? is a deduction game where players can see everyone else's cards save for their own.  Each turn players read off a question and answer it according to what they see on everyone's cards.  Eventually this gives players enough information to deduce what is on their own cards and winning a point.&#10;&#10;The cards that the players have to guess show different numbers. Variations of the game uses letters (What's That on My Head? &amp; Egghead) and numbers combined with colors (Code 777).

617;Alles Futsch;"The object of this game is to be the player with the most cash left when one other player goes bankrupt.&#10;&#10;Each player receives:&#10;1 play-table, which is placed face up in front of him&#10;4 marker stones&#10;Money worth 200,000 (3 x 50,000, 2 x 20,000, 1 x 5000, and 5 x 1000)&#10;&#10;The card holder is placed in the center of the table.&#10;The remaining cash is sorted and laid out in the bank..&#10;The object cards are shuffled and placed in the card holder.&#10;&#10;The top 5 cards are laid openly next to each other beside the card holder.&#10;&#10;If there are fewer than 5 players, the remaining play-tables and marker stones are placed back in the box.&#10;&#10;Play: Starting player selects one of the five face up cards for auction.&#10;&#10;Each player must increase the bids. Beginning with the player who selected the object card, in as many rounds as needed. Bids must increase by 1000 or a multiple thereof. Once a player passes, he may not re-enter this auction.&#10;&#10;The highest bidder pays the bank and receives the object card. The player may make change with the bank. The card will have 3 objects on it. The purchaser now has to distribute each of those objects.&#10;&#10;Three possibilities  exist for the card, each of the three objects on the card are used one at a time in any sequence desired.&#10;&#10;The sequence is decided by the player who paid for the card. Each item is released after it is used:&#10;&#10;1. An object for which he has only 0-2 copies in his collection: in this case he must take the object into his own collection. He sets one mark on the first field of the item or shifts it to the right to the next field. If this is the third type of an item, he immediately receives a bonus of 30000 from the bank.&#10;&#10;2. An object for which he already 3 or more copies in its collection. In this case he sells the object to any fellow player who has from 0-4 copies of the object in his collection. The fellow player cannot reject the purchase and must pay the seller 20000. The buyer moves his marker to the appropriate field. If this causes the marker to move to the third position, he should immediately receive a bonus of 30,000 marks from the bank.&#10;&#10;Note: the fourth and fifth objects of a type are thus always sold; one never receives these two objects from an object card that they have won for auction.&#10;&#10;Buying more than 3 types of art makes ones collection decrease in value. The buyer must pay the seller the fixed purchase price of 20000 marks and he must also pay 10,000 marks to the bank.&#10;&#10;3. A type of object which is not on his play-table (recognizably from the colored beam on his play-table at the bottom left hand corner). In this case, the auction winner sells such objects - as under 2 as described  to other players&#10;&#10;The object card is placed face up in the second side of the card holder after its 3 objects are distributed among the players.&#10;&#10;The top face down card is turned up and added to the remaining 4 face up cards.&#10;&#10;The player who purchased the last card, selects the next card to auction.&#10;&#10;The game ends the moment one of the players goes broke.&#10;&#10;First the fellow player is paid off, then the bank and then buyer receives any possible bonus.&#10;The winner is the player who has the most cash.

619;The Bottle Imp;"In this trick-taking game based on the short story by Robert Louis Stevenson of the same name, the goal is to gain the most points over a series of hands (usually the goal is set to 200 pts). Cards are numbered 1-37 and are found in three colors, red (comprising largely the highest numbers), blue (mostly in the middle) and yellow (mostly the lowest numbers) with colors being analogous to the suit in a standard deck.  There is one neutral card, the 19, that sets the &quot;price of the bottle.&quot;&#10;&#10;The entire deck is dealt to the three or four players in the game and then, similarly to hearts, cards are exchanged and a card is played to the bottle.  As per the usual elements of a trick taking game, players must follow suit if possible with high card taking the trick (regardless of suit).  The unique feature about this game however is how trump is determined.  Any card of value lower than the current price of the bottle (starting with 19) is considered &quot;trump&quot; and will win the trick.  If multiple cards are less than the current bottle price, the card valued closest to the current price (so highest card below the bottle) takes the trick AND THE BOTTLE, the bottle price is adjusted by the player taking the card that represents the current bottle price and replacing it with the card they used to win the trick.  Thus the price of the bottle will decrease with each trump card played, and the bottle is increasingly harder to win/purchase.  Ownership of the bottle will pass from player to player and the number of possible trump cards will decrease both as a factor of cards being played and cards being skipped as the bottle price descends.  One player will be stuck with the bottle at the end of a hand (when players have played all the cards in their hands).&#10;&#10;Cards have point values from 1-6 (not directly based on numerical value), at the end of the hand players will score points for the cards of tricks they've won, except the player who holds the bottle who will score NEGATIVE points for all the cards played to the bottle at the beginning, scoring nothing for the cards they won during the hand.  Play continues until the point goal is reached.&#10;&#10;In the 2003 edition the complete story by R.L. Stevenson http://gaslight.mtroyal.ab.ca/bottlimp.htm is included (in both English &amp; German) and the bottle is a nice wooden piece.

620;We the People;"We the People was the first in what has become a very popular trend for wargaming.  The typically hex-based maps were simplified into an abstract system of connected spaces, which are used for army movement and to keep track of who controls the provinces politically.  The armies themselves are greatly simplified, but the general in charge of the army gains much importance through his ratings for combat effectiveness and overall strategic effectiveness.  Typically, dice are used to resolve conflicts between troops, however a deck of battle cards are used instead, which captures the feel of conflict much better and gives approximately the same results seemingly without the bitterness that accompanies skewed die rolls.  And lastly, the overall ebb and flow of the game is determined through the play of strategy cards, which ostensibly mark certain historical events during the Revolutionary War, but each card has multiple purposes depending on which side is attempting to use it.&#10;&#10;";1993;7.30396;2.7055;2;2;120;12;Age of Reason, American Revolutionary War, Wargame;people popular trend wargame typically hex base map simplify abstract connected space army track province politically army greatly simplify general charge army gain importance rating combat effectiveness overall strategic effectiveness typically dice resolve conflict troop deck battle card instead capture feel conflict well give approximately result seemingly bitterness accompany skewed die lastly overall ebb flow determine strategy card ostensibly mark certain historical event revolutionary war card multiple purpose depend attempt use
621;25 Words or Less;"In 25 Words or Less, players divide up into two teams. The current clue-giver on each team looks at a list of five words that they're going to have to get their teammates to say using only words (a.k.a., no sounds or gestures). The clue-givers bid on the number of words that they need to say to accomplish the feat, with the lower bid getting the honor of doing so. If the team cannot successfully name the words in the allotted time and with the bid number of words (or less), then the other team gets the point.

The title of the game, Business, seems like a bit of a misnomer, because there is little about business in the game.  Each turn, a set of colored chips are auctioned off for each player, however, the number of chips and color combinations are different.  Players simultaneously bid some of their bankroll to determine what order they'll pick their set.  Once all the chips have been awarded, players can cash in sets of chips for the values on cards which change every turn.

Some players complained of ambiguities in these rules and the Campaign Game became known as difficult to play, and unbalanced for 2 players to play.  Some commented that the Campaign Game felt &quot;tacked on&quot; to an otherwise excellent collection of scenarios.  General Vol. 23 Issue 4 provided official rules to help with the 2 player Campaign Game.  However, regarding the Naval Rules, an official correction (2nd Edition Rules of '81) would further complicate matters until the game designer released his own update in General Vol. 19. Issue 5.  The Campaign Game was further altered for &quot;more realism&quot; by an article in General Vol. 31 Issue 2.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;3rd Edition GameThis Unofficial 3rd Edition of the Rules compiles and reconciles all of the differences in the rules, as published by Avalon Hill over the years.

Then, each turn, a different &quot;pilot&quot; rolls an increasing number of specialized dice to see if the balloon can stay aloft. The dice dictate how many of the balloon cards are needed of each color. (There are also optionally played Wild Cards to keep everyone guessing.) Each player decides whether they think the pilot will have the cards to successfully take the balloon up, or whether they should jump out and keep the points earned so far. If they stay, they run the risk of getting no points if the pilot fails. If the balloon does fall, it is placed back on the lowest cloud. Everyone hops aboard and draws one new card, and the next trip begins. When a player earns 50 points the game is over.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.48952;1.1527;3;6;30;8;Aviation / Flight, Bluffing, Card Game;cloud daring up down earn dare stay basket hot air balloon rise increase balloon climb cloud cloud risk balloon fall jump save trust pilot safely high place passenger token balloon basket start trip receive hand balloon card different pilot increase number specialized dice balloon stay aloft dice dictate balloon card need color optionally wild card guess decide think pilot card successfully balloon jump earn far stay run risk get pilot fail balloon fall place low cloud hop aboard draw new card trip begin earn
634;River Dragons;"In Dragon Delta, you want to move your pawn over a system of bridge-like planks to the other side of the board. An easy task! Or at least it would be if everyone were working together, but alas you're not. Instead you're all working on your own right next to one another, each convinced that your way is best.&#10;&#10;In game terms, players simultaneously select five action cards to be performed from the nine actions available and lay them down in order they are to be played. The turn is then resolved one card at a time. The actions allow players to place plank foundations, place planks, move their pawns, cancel other players' actions, or remove planks or foundation stones. As can be expected for a design with simultaneous action selection, the game is rather chaotic.&#10;&#10;The 2012 edition of the game, River Dragons, includes a double-sided game board not present in earlier editions, with one side of the board featuring rock piles on which you place stones (as in the original Dragon Delta), while the other side has a featureless river on which players can place stones in any location.&#10;&#10;";2000;6.49158;1.7195;2;6;30;8;Abstract Strategy;dragon delta want pawn bridge like plank easy task work alas instead work right convince way good term simultaneously select action card perform action available lie order resolve card time action allow place plank foundation place plank pawn cancel action remove plank foundation stone expect simultaneous action selection chaotic river dragon include double sided present early rock pile place stone original dragon delta featureless river place stone location
635;Formula Motor Racing;"In this light racing card game the players must try to maneuver their team of 2 racing cars into the podium positions over a series of races by playing cards to manipulate the line of vehicles to their advantage.&#10;&#10;Players can advance their position by playing cards that move their vehicles up the line or drag other team cars back. More powerful cards may require the roll of a dice and can result in great gains or disastrous engine blow-outs that can put cars out of the race and cannot rejoin the fray until the next race begins.&#10;&#10;Play is quick and simple with players required to play one action per turn, carry out its effects and drawing a card to end their turn. Each race will end after the draw deck is exhausted with one final turn taking place. Points are then awarded for positions 1-6 and a leaderboard is recorded. As the game evolves the leaderboard will be forever changing and in the final race the drivers will know what they have to do to earn the points in order to sit atop the final standings!&#10;&#10;";1995;6.4124;1.1801;3;6;20;8;Card Game, Racing, Sports;light racing card try maneuver team race car podium position series race card manipulate line vehicle advantage advance position card vehicle line drag team car powerful card require dice result great gain disastrous engine blow out car race rejoin fray race begin quick simple require action carry effect draw card end race end draw deck exhaust final take place award position leaderboard record evolve leaderboard forever change final race driver know earn order sit atop final standing
636;Blindside;"A Nomination Whist variant that is played with an odd deck of cards. The deck contains the four regular suits, but each has 2 Kings, 2 Queens and 3 Jacks, 3 '10's and 3 '9's. There are also four jokers, which &#10;count as the highest trump. At the end of each hand, the players score a point for each trick made, with a&#10;bonus of ten if you make exactly as many tricks as you bid. If you bid zero and made no tricks, you score&#10;20 points - which makes zero very valuable. The game ends when any player reaches 77 points at the end&#10;of a hand: the player with the most points wins.  Each hand starts with dealing out the entire deck. Each&#10;player uses one face down card as a bid for the trump suit.  If one suit has more cards than any other,&#10;this suit becomes trumps for the hand. If not, the hand is played as No Trumps. There is a clear trade-off&#10;here between getting the suit you want as trumps and retaining as many cards as possible in the suit.&#10;However, it can also be a useful way of reducing your holding in a particular suit. Or even throwing away &#10;a high card that would otherwise win a trick, if you are going to bid zero tricks.  Once the trump suit has &#10;been determined, each player, starting to the left of dealer, states how many tricks they expect to take.&#10;This gives an interesting advantage to the dealer.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.30526;2.0;4;4;0;0;Card Game;nomination whist odd deck card deck contain regular suit king queen jack joker count high trump end hand trick bonus exactly trick bid bid zero trick make zero valuable end reach end hand hand start deal entire deck use face card bid trump suit suit card suit trump hand hand trump clear trade get suit want trump retain card possible suit useful way reduce holding particular suit throw away high card trick go bid zero trick trump suit determine start left dealer state trick expect give interesting advantage dealer

638;Hera and Zeus;"Players are opposing gods from Greek mythology, Hera and Zeus, bent on destroying each other because each kidnapped the other's favorite mortal. Players lay out cards in opposite three-column, four-row matrices. Cards on the leading edges of the opposing columns can be used to attack, which means the combat value of the cards are compared and the loser is destroyed. However, cards are played facedown until they're engaged, adding an element of bluff and doubt to the game. Each turn, players have as many actions as they have columns, and actions can be used to attack, draw cards, or play special action cards. To win, you need to reduce the other player to zero columns, capture their hostage card from their hand, or make sure your opponent cannot use all of their actions during their turn.&#10;&#10;Hera &amp; Zeus is part of the Kosmos two-player series.&#10;&#10;";2000;6.48401;2.0479;2;2;30;12;Bluffing, Card Game, Mythology;oppose god greek mythology hera zeus bend destroy kidnap favorite mortal lie card opposite column row matrix card lead edge oppose column attack mean combat value card compare loser destroy card facedown engage add element bluff doubt action column action attack draw card special action card need reduce zero column capture hostage card hand sure opponent use action hera amp zeus kosmos series
639;American Megafauna;"From the designer/publisher:&#10;&#10;A quarter of a billion years ago, an unknown catastrophe engulfs the Earth. The swamps and ice caps of the Permian are replaced by the blistering deserts of the Triassic. On both land and sea, 96% of the animal species die.&#10;&#10;In the corner of Pangea that will be known as America, small survivors cautiously sniff the post-holocaust air at the dawn of the Mesozoic Era. Some of these unspecialized  quadrupeds have sloppy ever-replacing reptile teeth, these will be the dinosaurs. Others have sculpted &quot;one-shot&quot; teeth, these will be the mammals. The victor in this titanic  ecological struggle will determine the masters of the planet.&#10;&#10;Clearly, the ruling reptiles triumphed since that day, 248 million years ago, and dominated for 170 million years. Only to be overthrown, in what must be the upset of the eon, by the  mammals. Yet the contest is not over.&#10;&#10;American Megafauna pits dinosaurs against mammals in ancient America. The game is designed for two to four players, from  ages 9 to adult, or can be played solitaire. It recreates the titanic contest of these two types of prehistoric beasts from the  Triassic to the present.&#10;&#10;This is a game of ecology, evolution, and DNA. Players start as one of four nondescript archetypes, but can branch out to new species from this basic type by bidding on genotype and DNA cards as they are revealed. For auction &quot;currency,&quot; players use  gene coins from a &quot;gene pool.&quot; DNA cards allow players to create strange animals, from cud-chewing crocodiles with antlers, to  saber-tooth meat-eating camels.&#10;&#10;In the advanced version, the continent of Laurentia is occasionally flooded or glaciated; greenhouse levels change; and the three Milankovich cycles are handled by cards that occur with historical probabilities. Biome cards, including cicada prairies, mountains, ice sheets, and mangrove swamps, appear on the map in succession according to &quot;climax&quot; ratings.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    American Megafauna  (Second Edition): Expansion Set&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Bios: Megafauna&#10;&#10;&#10;";1997;6.84871;3.8163;1;4;360;9;Animals, Environmental, Prehistoric;designer publisher quarter billion year ago unknown catastrophe engulfs earth swamp ice cap permian replace blister desert triassic land sea animal specie die corner pangea know america small survivor cautiously sniff post holocaust air dawn mesozoic era unspecialized quadruped sloppy replace reptile tooth dinosaur sculpt shot tooth mammal victor titanic ecological struggle determine master planet clearly reptile triumph day million year ago dominate million year overthrow upset eon mammal contest american megafauna pit dinosaur mammal ancient america age adult solitaire recreate titanic contest prehistoric beast triassic present ecology evolution dna start nondescript archetype branch new specie basic bid genotype dna card reveal auction currency use gene coin gene pool dna card allow create strange animal cud chew crocodile antler saber tooth meat eat camel advanced continent laurentia occasionally flood glaciate greenhouse change milankovich cycle handle card occur historical probability biome card include cicada prairie mountain ice sheet mangrove swamp appear map succession accord climax rating expand american megafauna second set implement bio megafauna
642;Oodles;"Oodles is made up of three main items... a nifty ticking electronic timer that stops when you hold the button down and starts up again when you let go of it, an extraneous plastic Oodle stick (a large &quot;start player&quot; marker), and a deck of Oodle cards.&#10;&#10;Each card has 10 questions on it, plus a &quot;Silly Starter.&quot; The &quot;silly&quot; question is asked to the player currently holding the Oodle stick and if he/she answers correctly, they begin answering the questions on the card (each answer begins with the same letter). You are allowed only one guess... so if you're wrong, the moderator calls an &quot;all play&quot; and reads the question again. The first player to guess correctly wins the right to keep answering questions on the card - in case of ties, the tied players both take a shot at the next question. The player who answers the last question correctly gets the card... and five cards wins the game. (If the moderator is passing from person to person, if no one gets the last question, the moderator gets the card.)&#10;&#10;The joy of the game is in the odd crossword puzzle-like clues:&#10;  Q: Cowboy questionnaire&#10;  A: Gallup Poll&#10;  Q: A very serious hole&#10;  A: Grave&#10;  Q: Where they regularly hang painters&#10;  A: Gallery&#10;&#10;Q: Word to describe a naked grizzly&#10;  A: Bare&#10;  Q: Fish with a very deep voice&#10;  A: Bass&#10;&#10;Q: How to get around a circle&#10;  A: Circumference&#10;  Q: Lahr's Lion&#10;  A: Cowardly&#10;  Q: What the farmer does to his photos&#10;  A: Crops&#10;&#10;";1992;6.0869;1.3684;3;10;20;0;Party Game, Trivia;oodle main item nifty tick electronic timer stop hold button start let extraneous plastic oodle stick large start marker deck oodle card card question plus silly starter silly question ask currently hold oodle stick answer correctly begin answer question card answer begin letter allow guess wrong moderator call read question guess correctly right answer question card case tie tie shot question answer question correctly get card card moderator pass person person get question moderator get card joy odd crossword puzzle like clue q cowboy questionnaire gallup poll q hole grave q regularly hang painter gallery q word describe naked grizzly bare q fish deep voice bass q circle circumference q lahr lion cowardly q farmer photo crop
643;Deadlands: Doomtown Range Wars;"Doomtown: Range Wars is a customizable disc game.  Each of the boxed sets contains 8 sheets of die-cut discs which may contain an assortment of combat markers, weapons and ammo, spells, cowboys, supernatural adversaries, terrain, buildings, and more. The starter set also includes a rulebook, and everything needed to play.  These sets were produced in 2000 by Fantasy Flight Games, and are set in the Deadlands game world of the wild west (but there are other themes that use the same disc mechanism).&#10;&#10;This game uses full-color illustrated discs to represent the cowboys, supernatural beings, buildings, and other accessories used in the game.  The discs are used to wage gunfights and large-scale western battles.  The discs each have game stats such as: pistol/rifle skill, hand-to-hand combat, movement, leadership, wounds, and special abilities which can help or hinder combat. This game is similar in style to many military wargames, except that the counters are much larger (1.5 to 4 inches in diameter!), allowing for amazing full-color unit illustrations, and detailed special abilities like those seen in fantasy card games.&#10;&#10;";2000;6.29207;2.2;2;8;90;10;American West, Collectible Components, Fantasy;doomtown range war customizable disc boxed set contain sheet die cut disc contain assortment combat marker weapon ammo spell cowboy supernatural adversary terrain building starter set include rulebook need set produce fantasy flight set deadland world wild west use disc mechanism use color illustrate disc represent cowboy supernatural being building accessory disc wage gunfight large scale western battle disc stat pistol rifle skill hand hand combat leadership wound special help hinder combat similar style military wargame large inch diameter allow amazing color unit illustration detailed special like see fantasy card
644;Shipwrecked;"You are Shipwrecked... to survive, you must compete head-to-head in a bid for food, shelter, water, and friends. These entertaining contests require strategy, intuition, and nerve to determine who survives and who doesn't.&#10;   &#10;This is an auction bidding game. Each round, the lead off player flips over a card from the deck which will then be auctioned off. There are also Hidden Resource cards in the deck. When one comes up, players bid for the next card in the deck without knowing what it is!  Each player has 6 bid markers: 3 Pass, 2 Stop, and 1 Strike. Each round of each auction, a player must place one of these markers face down. The first round, the markers are placed in the '5 position'. This means if the auction is stopped at this position, the winner pays 5 for the item. If no one stops the auction, players place a marker in the '4 position'. Once again, if the auction is stopped, the winner pays 4 for the item. These rounds continue until the auction is stopped, or until the auction moved to the last '0 position'. Once the auction for that item is complete, the deck passes to the next player. Each time the deck comes to a player, he collects income as listed on each item card he owns. He may then choose to place an item sold back to the bank up for auction, or draw one from the deck to be auctioned. One thing that makes Shipwrecked stand out from other auction games is that you can't 'not bid'. You must participate in the auction, even if you really don't want the item.&#10;&#10;";2000;5.71049;1.4681;2;4;30;12;Card Game;shipwreck survive compete head head bid food shelter water friend entertaining contest require strategy intuition nerve determine survive doesn t auction bidding lead card deck auction hide resource card deck come bid card deck know bid marker pass stop strike auction place marker face marker place position mean auction stop position winner pay item stop auction place marker position auction stop winner pay item continue auction stop auction position auction item complete deck pass time deck come collect income list item card own choose place item sell bank auction draw deck auction thing makes shipwreck stand auction t bid participate auction don t want item
645;Bosworth;"Bosworth is essentially a chess variant for up to 4 players.  The pieces are the same as chess (8 pawns, 2 knights, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, a king, and a queen), but they are represented as disks so that they can be drawn randomly from a pile.&#10;&#10;Players begin the game with 4 pawns in their edge of the board or &quot;field camps&quot; and four pieces from their draw pile as their hand.&#10;&#10;On each turn, a player must move or capture with one piece, fill empty spaces in their field camp with a piece from their hand, and then draw to bring their hand up to four pieces.&#10;&#10;Pieces move and capture just like in chess, except for pawns, which can move sideways and capture in any diagonal direction, and kings, which can capture their own pieces to escape check.

646;Pirate's Plunder;"Pirate's Plunder is a card and dice game in which players take on the roles of pirates and engage in a life of swashbuckling adventure on the high seas.&#10;&#10;The game is played in turns.  At the start of the game, each player starts off in a lifeboat.  They have to steal a pirate ship (based on the result of a dice roll), otherwise, they are stuck in the lifeboat and have to skip their turn.  When they have a ship, players draw Playing Cards into their hand.  These cards offer maps for treasures, events to modify a pirate's guns and crews, and other ways to bend the rules of the game.&#10;&#10;A pirate's score is reflected by his treasure, which comes from the wealth-laden ships, loot, and hostages in the form of Treasure Cards.  These cards are drawn from their deck when a pirate plays a map in hand, or by making a successful &quot;Sail Ho!&quot; dice roll during their turn.  Pirates can bury their treasure to keep them safe, although they have to dig it up for it to be counted as score.&#10;&#10;Some Treasure Cards, however, are perils in the forms of deadly pirates (such as Blackbeard) and naval warships.  Players can play perils on fellow pirates, forcing them to engage in combat.  Players can also engage other players in battle as well during a successful &quot;Sail Ho!&quot; dice roll if they choose to do so instead of drawing Treasure Cards.  Such battles are resolved by comparing dice rolls, which are added to the player's number of guns or crew.  The loser's ship is sunk and the player has to start his or her subsequent turns in a lifeboat.  The winner also takes the loser's unburied treasure.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a pirate has 3,000 or more pieces of eight worth of unburied treasure and makes a successful dice roll to &quot;Sail Home&quot;, thus becoming the winner.&#10;&#10;";2000;4.56311;1.5;2;6;30;8;Card Game, Dice, Pirates;pirate plunder card dice role pirate engage life swashbuckling adventure high sea start start lifeboat steal pirate ship base result dice stick lifeboat skip ship draw playing card hand card offer map treasure event modify pirate gun crew way bend pirate reflect treasure come wealth laden ship loot hostage form treasure card card draw deck pirate map hand make successful sail ho dice pirate bury treasure safe dig count treasure card peril form deadly pirate blackbeard naval warship peril fellow pirate force engage combat engage battle successful sail ho dice choose instead draw treasure card battle resolve compare dice add number gun crew loser ship sink start subsequent lifeboat winner take loser unburied treasure end pirate piece worth unburied treasure make successful dice sail home winner

651;Zero Down;"How low can you go? In Zero, you want to score as few points as possible, but to do that you need to collect the right cards in hand.&#10;&#10;The deck consists of 56 cards, with cards numbered 1-8 in seven colors. Each player starts with nine cards in hand, and five, seven or nine cards start face-up on the table depending on the number of players. On a turn, you either knock on the table to pass or you swap one card in hand for one card on the table. After the second knock, whether from the same player or a different one, all players other than the second knocker have one final chance to swap, after which they reveal and score their hands. If you have five or more cards of the same color or number in hand, then those cards score 0 points. For each other number you have, no matter how many copies, you score points equal to that card's value. Thus, having one to four 7s in hand is worth 7 points.&#10;&#10;If, however, you manage to collect both five cards of a color and five cards of a number in hand (with one card fitting in both sets), then you can declare &quot;Zero!&quot; and end the round immediately, with everyone else scoring points as usual.&#10;&#10;After a number of rounds equal to the number of players, whoever has the lowest score wins!&#10;&#10;";1998;6.48202;1.2364;2;5;20;8;Card Game;low zero want possible need collect right card hand deck consist card card number seven color start card hand seven card start face table depend number knock table pass swap card hand card table second knock different second knocker final chance swap reveal hand card color number hand card number matter copy equal card value have hand worth manage collect card color card number hand card fit set declare zero end immediately usual number equal number low

653;Shit!;"It is a game where everyone simultaneously plays a unique number face down card a la Take 5 (6 Nimmt).&#10;&#10;There are 5 suits arranged in a circular pattern. The idea is you score the points based on the first person to hit their number traveling clockwise after the current number, e.g. if the colors are Green, Blue, Red, Yellow, Orange, Green, Blue, etc. and the current target card is Orange 6, then the first number after orange 6 wins a number of points equal to the interval. For example, orange 7 would win 1 point, but if it were not there and Green 1 were next closest, it would win 5 points. If the next closest card were orange 5 (unlikely but possible), it would score 49 points.&#10;&#10;Each player also always has in hand a Shit! card which cannot score, but playing it is the only way to get another card in hand. Strategy comes from watching when people play cards and how many they have left. Time it right and you can play while everyone else is drawing for monster points.&#10;&#10;It's a fun 20 minutes.

Cards are played into one of four regions: in the courtyard, on the battlements, on the towers, or outside the castle.

657;MÃ¼nchhausen;"A pure bluffing game. Each player gets a set of cards numbered 1 to 8 and a playing mat, which goes in front of him or her. The starting player is the Baron and the other players in turn offer him a card face down from their hand, stating the value. Each player must offer an equal or higher value card than the last and the Baron must take the highest card offered or choose between equal offers. The Baron must then decide to Accept or Reject the offer. If he accepts, the Baron puts the card face down on his mat and the turn passes to the next player. But if the Baron decides the player was lying and Rejects the offer, he turns the card over. If the offer was False, the player takes it back to their hand and the Baron gets to dump one of his cards onto his mat. But if it was True, The Baron must take the card into his hand and the player dumps a card face down. When a player's hand is empty, the game is over and you total the value of the cards on your mat, subtracting any left in your hand. Highest score wins. A simple game of pure bluff, it works incredibly well. Very funny and requires some thought.

660;Riffifi;"From session report:&#10;A card game. The deck consists of five  different colored sets of cards, each set numbered 1 - 8. There are  also five matching sets of wooden disks, 10 of each color.&#10;&#10;The cards are dealt out equally to the players and they alternate playing one card face-up to the table. Unlike a trick-taking game, there is no need to follow suit; players may play any card they desire. If a player lays a card of the same color and a LOWER value as a previously laid card that round, the higher card is turned over and is out of play. When play returns to a player who still has his card face-up in front of him, he collects a number of chips from the stockpile which matches the number and color of the card he played. If his card is face-down, however, he does not collect any chips. In either case, he plays another card and the cycle continues until the players have played all of their cards.&#10;&#10;When collecting chips, if the stockpile of a certain color is depleted, the player then steals the required number and color of chips from the opponent who currently possesses the most chips of that color. Thus, each player's collection of chips is constantly in danger of being confiscated by their opponents.&#10;&#10;The basic rules call for a number of rounds equal to the number of players, with the player collecting the greatest cumulative total of chips over those rounds being the victor.&#10;&#10;";2000;6.14861;1.0;3;5;15;10;Card Game;session report card deck consist different colored set card set number matching set wooden disk color card deal equally alternate card face table unlike trick taking need follow suit card desire lay card color low value previously lay card high card return card face collect number chip stockpile match number color card card face collect chip case card cycle continue card collect chip stockpile certain color deplete steal require number color chip opponent currently possess chip color chip constantly danger confiscate opponent basic number equal number collect great cumulative total chip victor
661;Where's Bob's Hat?;"A form of estimation whist, with three colored suits (cards from 1 to 20), and the possibility of trumps or no-trumps.   You have to bid for which suit (or suits) you think you will capture most cards of, or you can bid to capture fewer cards than anyone else.   Get it right, you score; get it wrong, you take a penalty.   The number of cards per hand increases round by round, and the number of rounds depends on the number of players.&#10;&#10;From the Box:&#10;Where's Bob's Hat? is best with 3 or 4 players. Over several hands, players bid to take the most cards in one or more of the three suits, each a different kind of hat. Players who feel they will take few, if any, tricks may bid to take the fewest cards in tricks played during each hand. Players score points for making their bids and lose points for missing their bids.&#10;&#10;Several cards picture Bob's Hat in addition to the hat of their suit. When a player wins a trick containing a card with Bob's Hat on it, the player takes the Bob's Hat card (worth plus or minus 10 points). The player with the card at the end of the hand add (or subtracts) 10 points to his score.

On your turn, you draw a card, then play a &quot;gapper&quot; if possible (a gapper is a card falling between the numbers where the sliders rest, as indicated by the sliders' arrowheads), and finally discard a card, moving a slider to the discards number. There are wild cards in the deck.&#10;&#10;If a player goes out, he wins 5 points plus one point per card still held by the other players. 25 points wins the game.&#10;&#10;";1968;6.40857;1.0;2;4;30;10;Card Game;use ring number slider start slider set randomly card draw draw card gapper possible gapper card fall number slider rest indicate slider arrowhead finally discard card slider discard number wild card deck go plus card hold

670;Starship Troopers;"Starship Troopers is based upon the popular novel of the same name written by the dean of Science-Fiction writers, Robert A. Heinlein. In the novel, Heinlein describes a futuristic war involving homo sapiens from our Earth (Terrans) against a Humanoid race (nicknamed the 'Skinnies' for obvious physical attributes) and their cobelligerents, the totally alien Arachnids. Since this is a story of future wars and future advances in technology, much is changed in the fields of weaponry and tactics and strategy. One thing remains the same, however; the fighting still rests on the shoulders of the individual infantryman. Although great starships has shuttle men between the distant solar systems and the power of individual weapons has risen to awesome heights, wars still cannot be won unless men venture onto the face of alien planets and fight the enemy on their home ground. As Juan Rico, the protagonist of the novel, relates:&#10;&#10;&quot;We are the boys who go to a particular place, at H-Hour, occupy a designated terrain, stand on it, dig the enemy out of their holes, force them then and there to surrender or die. We're the bloody infantry, the doughboy, the duckfoot, the foot soldier who goes where the enemy is and takes him on in person.&quot;&#10;&#10;Although the mission remains the same, future inventiveness has changed the method considerably. In a galaxy-wide war, manpower is at a premium. Platoons fight where entire armies once tred. But these platoons possess the firepower equivalence of a Twentieth-Century mechanized division. More importantly, each man in the platoon is provided with a piece of hardware that allows him to fight and survive in the holocausts of future combat&mdash;his powered armor suit. As Rico describes it:&#10;&#10;&quot;A suit isn't a spacesuit &mdash; although it can serve as one. A suit is not a space ship but it can fly&mdash;a little . . . Suited up, you look like a big steel gorilla, armed with gorillasized weapons. But the suits are considerably stronger than a gorilla. If a Mobile Infantry man in a suit swapped hugs with a gorilla, the gorilla would be dead, crushed; the man and the suit wouldn't be mussed . . . The real genius in the design is that you don't have to control the suit, you just wear it, like your clothes, like skin . . . Even riding a bicycle demands an acquired skill, very different from walking. But a suit you just wear.&quot;&#10;&#10;With the suit and the incredible array of weaponry that go with it, the Mobile Infantry soldier is an exceedingly formidable opponent. He had better be. The enemies he faces are the most awesome adversaries in the galaxy. Of the two extraterrestrial races fighting the Terrans, the Humanoids are the least revolting. Rico describes them as&#10;&#10;&quot; . . . humanoid, eight or nine feet tall, much skinnier than we are and with a higher body temperature; they don't wear any clothes and they stand out in a set of 'snoopers' like a neon sign.&quot;&#10;&#10;In early scenarios they are fighting on the side of the Arachnids.  In later scenarios, after successful negotiations with Earth, they switch over to the Terran side. They're only effective fighters within the confines of their small city terrain and strong points on the board.&#10;&#10;But the 'Skinnies' were mild looking in comparison to the Arachnids:&#10;&#10;&quot;The 'Bugs' are not like us. The Pseudo-Arachnids aren't even like spiders. They are arthropods who happen to look like a madman's concept of a giant, intelligent spider, but their organization, psychological and economic, is more like that of ants or termites; they are communal entities, the ultimate dictatorship of the hive . . . But don't make the mistake of thinking that they act purely from instinct . . . their actions are as intelligent as ours (stupid races don't build spaceships!) and were much better coordinated. It takes a minimum of a year to train a private to fight and to mesh his fighting with his mates; a Bug warrior is hatched able to do this ...&quot;&#10;&#10;As the Arachnid Player, uses an Alien Control Pad sheet to record the placement of his underground central Hive cell complex and the attached tunnels radiating outward. Tunnels are used to move the Warrior units, along with Worker units mixed in as expendable decoys, to locations where they can pop up to the surface through a breach hole and attack the Terran units.  Completely unseen, and only paper recorded, Engineer units are used to create the breaches and, later, to extend the tunnels.&#10;&#10;The game is set up in a &quot;Programmed Instruction&quot; system of scenarios to slowly introduce the game concepts. Scenarios range from Scenario I, which starts players off with a basic MI raid on a Skinny city (just like the book. &quot;Flores died on the way up&quot;) to Scenario VII, The Battle of Klendathu: the final Terran assault on the Arachnid Homeworld.&#10;&#10;Warfare in the Twenty-second Century is the ultimate test of survivability of the human race.

671;Bull Run: The First Major Battle of the American Civil War;"&quot;Bull Run: The First Major Battle of the American Civil War&quot; is a tactical combat wargame of the first battle of Bull Run.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a map of the area over which the battle was fought overlaid with a hexagonal grid. Units are infantry, cavalry, and artillery, with brigade, division, and army leaders. Each turn is 30 minutes, and each hex represents 1000 ft. Units are basically regiments and batteries. Some infantry regiments with their brigade leader are capable of forming brigades, increasing offensive power at the expense of movement. Batteries can be limbered for increased movement at the expense of firepower, or unlimbered with full firepower and limited movement.&#10;&#10;Combat is a modified version of the classic system adopted by the earlier Avalon Hill games.  However, rules for leader command activation, infantry screening of artillery, and infantry forming brigades to prevent soak-off attacks, ranged artillery, rally of losses are give the game a unique flavour.&#10;&#10;The major terrain obstacle is Bull Run which provides the Confederate with defensive advantages and hinders Union movement. &#10; The game begins with the Union troops approaching partially hidden, unsuspecting Confederate forces.  As the Union attack develops, additional Confederate leaders and combat units are activated and are rushed to stem the Union advance.  The Union player wins if he is able to capture any of three objective hexes by the end of the game or takes Manassas at any time.  The Confederate player wins if he takes Centreville at any time or prevents the Union player from holding any of objective hexes at the game end.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a 32&quot; by 22&quot; mapboard, 260 counters, various charts, a 12 page rulebook and 1 die.&#10;&#10;&#10;Magazine References:&#10;&#10;The GENERAL Index  Article List:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The GENERAL Vol.20,No.5&#10;        Series Replay - Bull Run: The First Major Battle of the American Civil War, Rex A.

673;Star Traders;"from user review:&#10;Each player assumes the role of a intra-galactic merchant, traveling from planet to planet in a future where wars are unheard of and &quot;Traders&quot; are the heroes of the cosmos. The board shows 36 planets: six clustered together in the center of the board, six more in each of five arms of the galaxy. Planets are connected by &quot;jump lines&quot;: you can jump to an adjacent planet on an orange line, to a planet halfway down a galaxy arm on a purple line, and from one galaxy arm to another via green lines. The length of the jump line also indicates the difficulty of the jump, so to successfully complete an &quot;orange' jump you must roll a 2 or better on a single die, a purple jump requires a 4 or better, and the green jumps necessitate a 6.&#10;&#10;As the players scurry about the galaxy, they can pick up and deliver cargoes, which pay both in money and in &quot;Prestige.&quot; These &quot;contracts&quot; vary throughout the game, and only one player can fulfill any given contract. This isn't to say that multiple players can't pick up the named cargo, though. But only the first player to arrive at the contract's destination gets the payoff for a contract; everyone else with the cargo is now just stuck with unwanted junk, and may have to pay a penalty to dump it. Players can also build bases on the various planets as they move around. Building bases earns the players Prestige, and when a player tries to make a jump to a planet with a base, the jump is an automatic success if the player has the owner's permission. Traders obviously have permission to jump to their own bases, but if they want to jump to an opponent's, they will probably have to pay a fee. And since only one player can have a base on any given planet, bases rapidly become lucrative investments.&#10;&#10;";1987;6.34702;2.3043;2;6;120;12;Economic, Science Fiction;user review assume role intra galactic merchant travel planet planet future war unheard trader hero cosmos show planet cluster center arm galaxy planet connect jump line jump adjacent planet orange line planet halfway galaxy arm purple line galaxy arm green line length jump line indicate difficulty jump successfully complete orange jump well single die purple jump require well green jump necessitate scurry galaxy pick deliver cargo pay money prestige contract vary fulfill give contract isn t multiple t pick name cargo arrive contract destination get payoff contract cargo stick unwanted junk pay penalty dump build basis planet build basis earn prestige try jump planet base jump automatic success owner permission trader obviously permission jump basis want jump opponent probably pay fee base give planet basis rapidly lucrative investment

676;Ninja Wars;"Proudly touted as a &quot;NON-collectable card game,&quot; Ninja Wars is a simple battle game with single die rolls determining victory. Each player gets three town cards of identical strength and five randomly dealt hero cards with values ranging from 1 to 5. Players are dealt hands of five action cards they can use to attack players towns and heroes or to strengthen their own heroes and towns. Gold cards are also in the action deck which allow players to bolster the value of an attack card. Battling players each roll a die and add the  scores of either their attack and gold cards (for the attacker) or the hero/town and training cards (for the defender). Play is simple and quick for a battle card game.

677;Would You Rather...?;"Before they can roll and move, players must pick a card and present the rest of the players with a nasty choice between two thoroughly unpleasant hypotheticals in categories such as pain, embarrassment, ethics, and ingestion. If the player guesses the majority preference, he gets to move otherwise he must pass. Some spaces allow the player to invent their own awful hypothetical choice. The other players vote secretly on their choice in this case. If the vote is not unamimous, the player can move or send someone else back. Players roll a six-sided die and there are only 10 spaces to the goal so games go very quickly. Typical choices on the cards include, &quot;Would you rather lie naked in a bathtub full of live roaches or dive head first into a pool of tobacco spit?&quot; The answer &quot;neither&quot; is NEVER allowed.&#10;&#10;Variant:&#10;The 2003 version of this game &quot;Would You Rather?&quot; appears to have quite different rules to the above described game. There is a new simpler square board with more spaces. Unlike the 20 minutes of the above game, 1-2 hours is recommended by the manufacturer. Players roll a dice, then move and depending where they land, draw cards with dilemmas to pose to the rest of the other players. The current player must try to secretly predict the result of the other players' subsequent open discussion and consensus view. No-one is penalised for an inability to reach consensus, the game encourages one option picked at random perhaps by flipping a coin, to keep the game moving. If the current player predicted correctly, they get a bonus turn.&#10;&#10;Typical questions include &quot;Would you rather ... On senior prom night, have to take your parent -OR- your 12 year old sibling?&quot;&#10;&#10;Every so often players get the opportunity to take a difficult challenge with the winner being the first person to complete their third challenge.&#10;&#10;";1998;4.36561;1.1957;3;8;20;12;Party Game;pick card present rest nasty thoroughly unpleasant hypothetical category pain embarrassment ethic ingestion guess majority preference get pass space allow invent awful hypothetical vote secretly case vote unamimous send sided die space quickly typical card include lie naked bathtub live roach dive head pool tobacco spit answer allow appear different describe new simple square space unlike minute hour recommend manufacturer dice depend land draw card dilemma pose rest current try secretly predict result subsequent open discussion consensus view penalise inability reach consensus encourage option pick random coin current predict correctly bonus typical question include senior prom night parent year old sibling opportunity difficult challenge winner person complete challenge
678;X-it!;"X-it! is simple mix of &quot;Spite and Malice&quot; (aka Skip-Bo) and solitaire mechanics. There are two decks which each have four suits with 20 cards in each suit. One deck is used to establish a large tableau on a circular gameboard which has 26 card slots around the circumference and four slots forming a central &quot;X&quot;.  The second deck also contains 8 wild cards. Seven cards are dealt to each player from this second deck. The goal is to lay off all the cards in your hand onto one or more of the four &quot;X&quot; cards. The twist is you must be able to dump your entire hand on a single turn. In lieu of this option, a player must try to play a card onto one of the 26 ring cards. Ring and &quot;X&quot; cards must first be &quot;opened&quot; by playing the exact same card on it. After this, cards of any suit may be played on open cards in runs of ascending or descending order. At the end of a turn, a player must play a card even if he was able to discard. If a player puts a card into a run that could have been used to open a card, he loses a turn and must take a penalty card from the player who catches him in the act.&#10;&#10;";1997;4.04883;2.0;2;6;20;12;Card Game;x simple mix spite malice aka skip bo solitaire deck suit card suit deck establish large tableau circular gameboard card slot circumference slot form central x second deck contain wild card seven card deal second deck lay card hand x card twist able dump entire hand single lieu option try card ring card ring x card open exact card card suit open card run ascend descend order end card able discard put card run open card penalty card catch act

As each piece moves, it literally leaves a paper trail of cardboard chits showing its progress through the game. A piece can be captured at any point on its timeline by landing on a square containing a chit, and any actions taken since then by that piece are reversed. In this way a piece can capture an opposing piece 'earlier' than when that piece captured a friendly piece, thereby returning the friendly piece to the board.

685;Marrakesh;"Marrakesh was designed by Prince Joli Kansil of Hawaii, the same designer as Bridgette, the two-handed bridge game. Marrakesh is an odd amalgam of backgammon and cardplay which works remarkably well. Each player sets up six pieces on their board based on the roll of six dice. Each player is dealt a hand of six cards from a special deck, and then try to collect two card tricks, using the card values to bear off the pieces. Points are awarded for bearing off pieces in various combinations, such as 2 on each of three turns, or the legendary Marrakesh itself, when all six pieces are borne off on the same turn. Defensive points are earned for keeping the opponent from removing many pieces from their board. Play continues for 12 rounds, which goes by quickly. This game is long out-of-print, but well worth it if you can find it.&#10;&#10;";1978;6.74941;1.8571;2;2;45;0;Abstract Strategy, Card Game, Dice;marrakesh prince joli kansil hawaii designer bridgette handed bridge marrakesh odd amalgam backgammon cardplay work remarkably set piece base dice deal hand card special deck try collect card trick card value bear piece award bear piece combination legendary marrakesh piece bear defensive earn keep opponent remove piece continue go quickly long print worth find
686;Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde;"An interesting little game that uses a miniscule deck of 28 cards, consisting of 2 identical suits of Sun and Moon cards. Each partnership takes the part of either the Sun or Moon cult, and plays cards only of its designated suit. An interesting mechanic is that since the cards are dealt randomly, it is often necessary and even prudent to have an opponent play a card for you. The object of the game is to collect souls (of either cult) and temples of your own suit (which serve as a multiplier). Rounds move quickly, and points can add up dramatically.

The game map represents Manchu China.&#10;&#10;The Taiping player starts at an advantage in troops and leaders and seeks to conquer enough of the country to force a collapse of the Manchu government.  The Manchu player seeks to survive the Taiping onslaught, and gains strength as the provincial forces are brought to bear.  However, over-reliance on provincial forces will cause a reduction of Imperial authority, and that in itself may cause the game to be lost.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a map, playing counters, rules and numerous charts.&#10;&#10;A remake The Dragon and The Cross was published in 2018.&#10;&#10;";1988;6.03871;2.5;2;2;240;12;Post-Napoleonic, Wargame;include insert strategy amp tactic magazine errata appear amp t manchu wargame cover taiping rebellion occur manchu china strategic scale unit generic strength represent taiping rebel manchu banner troop provincial army troop bandit mongolian cavalry map represent manchu china taiping start advantage troop leader seek conquer country force collapse manchu government manchu seek survive taiping onslaught gain strength provincial force bring bear reliance provincial force cause reduction imperial authority cause consist map numerous chart remake dragon cross publish
689;Dubble Kross;"Dubble Kross uses a regurlar deck of cards, two six-sided dice, 11 plastic pegs and a house-shaped pegboard. Cards 2 through Queen each have a track on the board. Kings, aces and jokers are used as special action cards. After dealing out all the cards, four dice rolls determine the four penalty numbers. Any one who has the corresponding cards in their hands must pay to the kitty. In phase two, each player rolls the dice and either advances the corresponding peg on the board or pays more to the pot if the a penalty number is rolled. Like Parker Bros. &quot;Can't Stop&quot;, the length of each track is proportional to the probability of the roll. Therefore, the  &quot;7&quot; peg must travel the greatest distance while the &quot;2&quot; and &quot;12&quot; (Queen) pegs need only travel three spaces to win. When a peg crosses the finish line unchallenged, each corresponding card in players' hands are worth a quarter of the pot.&#10;&#10;";1991;8.0;0.0;3;10;120;0;Card Game, Dice;dubble kross use regurlar deck card sided dice plastic peg house shape pegboard card queen track king ace joker special action card deal card dice determine penalty number correspond card hand pay kitty dice advance corresponding peg pay pot penalty number like parker bro t stop length track proportional probability peg travel great distance queen peg need travel space peg cross finish line unchallenge corresponding card hand worth quarter pot

691;Timbuktu;"In this game each player takes the role of a caravan leader. The number of camels within a caravan depends on the number of players. Each camel is loaded with a lot of goods, and the goal of the game is to carry all the goods from the starting position to the final oasis: Timbuktu.&#10;&#10;However, during the course of this journey, the caravans stop at other oases. Once all camels arrive at an oasis, and night falls, thieves attack the caravan and steal different goods. While moving from one oasis to another, players receive different clues about the nature of the thefts. Each player has a different clue, and although clues are passed around, only one player receives three of the total five clues. From the actions of the other players (caravan leaders), the clues have to be guessed and camels have to be relocated, in order to save all the goods from the thieves.&#10;&#10;The next morning, the caravan continues its way towards Timbuktu, and players are challenged with different clues again.

699;HeroQuest;"HeroQuest is Milton Bradley's approach to a Dungeons &amp; Dragons-style adventure game.  One player acts as game master, revealing the maze-like dungeon piecemeal as the players wander.  Up to four other players take on a character (wizard, elf, dwarf, or barbarian) and venture forth into dungeons on fantasy quests. This game was made in cooperation with Games Workshop Ltd. who designed the miniatures and helped in many of the production details including background world and art in the rule book and scenario book. The HeroQuest series consists of the main game and a number of expansions.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a grid representing the interior of a dungeon or castle, with walls segmenting the grid into rooms and corridors. One player assumes the role of the evil wizard character (Zargon/Morcar), and uses a map taken from the game's quest book to determine how the quest is to be played. The map details the placement of monsters, artifacts, and doors, as well as the overall quest the other players are embarking upon. During a Hero's turn, the player can move before or after performing one of the following actions: attack, cast a spell, search for traps and secret doors, search for treasure.&#10;&#10;The game ends when every player has either returned to the spiral staircase, exited by a door, or been killed by the evil wizard. If the objective of the quest has not been accomplished then the evil wizard character wins. Items collected during the quest may be kept for future quests. The quests usually form part of a longer story, especially the quests which are part of the expansion packs.&#10;&#10;Additional material, which is generally missed since it is not technically an expansion, was published in the HeroQuest: Adventure Design Kit which did feature one more Heroquest adventure: A Plague of Zombies.&#10;&#10;";1989;7.2129;2.1335;2;5;90;14;Adventure, Exploration, Fantasy, Fighting, Miniatures;heroquest milton bradley approach dungeon amp dragon style adventure act master reveal maze like dungeon piecemeal wander character wizard elf dwarf barbarian venture forth dungeon fantasy quest cooperation games workshop ltd miniature help production detail include background world art book book heroqu series consist main number grid represent interior dungeon castle wall segment grid room corridor assume role evil wizard character zargon morcar use map take quest book determine quest map detail monster artifact door overall quest embark hero perform follow action attack cast spell search trap secret door search treasure end return spiral staircase exit door kill evil wizard quest accomplish evil wizard character item collect quest keep future quest quest usually form long story especially quest pack additional material generally miss technically publish heroqu adventure kit heroqu adventure plague zombie

If an Escape Officer can free a pre-determined number of POWs (usually 2) before then, they win. Otherwise the Security Officer wins.&#10;&#10;The game was co-designed by Major PR Reid, a British soldier who was one of the few to actually successfully escape from Colditz during the Second World War.&#10;&#10;";1973;6.67953;2.2227;2;6;180;12;Adventure, World War II;escape colditz vs semi cooperative security officer german force escape officer nationality prisoner war pow escape officer try acquire equipment need successful escape rope wire cutter etc security officer try hinder put solitary confinement consficate equipment last pre determine length time number escape officer free pre determine number pow usually security officer co major pr reid british soldier actually successfully escape colditz second world war

718;Galaxy: The Dark Ages;"Galaxy: The Dark Ages is the much-awaited sequel to AH's Titan: the Arena.  Originally, this game was Knizia's Grand National Derby, but two successive changes in theme have added much chrome to the design.  The basic idea remains intact: there are eight alien races, and at the end the only three will remain; bet on the aliens you think will make it to the end.  Numbered cards, starships in this case, are played below the alien homeworld cards.  As soon as each alien has a ship card and there is a definitive loser, said loser alien race is removed and a new round starts.  Several of the alien powers differ from those of TtA.  This version of the game adds further detail by calling the betting chips &quot;starbases&quot;, which may be targeted by opponents' ships to lower their value.&#10;&#10;";2000;6.27079;2.4154;2;5;90;12;Card Game, Science Fiction;galaxy dark age await sequel ah titan arena originally knizia grand national derby successive change add chrome basic idea remain intact alien race end remain bet alien think end number card starship case alien homeworld card soon alien ship card definitive loser say loser alien race remove new start alien power differ tta add detail call bet chip starbase target opponent ship lower value

720;Fast Food Franchise;"Players compete with each other to start fast food corporations, open new markets, launch advertising campaigns, and build nationwide chains of restaurants.  The winner is the first player to make a million dollars, or be the only player left in the game if all other players go bankrupt.&#10;&#10;From Wikipedia:&#10;Initially, the game looks like Monopoly. There is a board, with spaces around the edges. Some of these spaces can be controlled. Each time you land on a space controlled by an opponent, you pay them money.&#10;&#10;The inside of the board is an abstracted map of the United States. There are no fixed &quot;color groups;&quot; rather, your controlled outer spaces (&quot;Markets&quot;) are the major cities of the USA, and you need to use the inner map to connect these markets.&#10;&#10;Connected markets act like multiple colors in a color group. However, the expansion in the middle map is far more strategic than random.&#10;&#10;Where Monopoly is a game about trading property, Fast Food Franchise is a game of controlling the inner map.&#10;&#10;";1992;6.34108;2.1389;2;5;180;12;Economic;compete start fast food corporation open new market launch advertising campaign build nationwide chain restaurant winner million dollar leave bankrupt wikipedia initially look like monopoly space edge space time land space opponent pay money inside abstract map united states fix color group outer space markets major city usa need use inner map connect market connected market act like multiple color color group middle map far strategic random monopoly trade property fast food franchise inner map

739;Ultimate Soccer of America;"Described by the Publisher/Designer:&#10;&#10;Ultimate Soccer is a new and exciting soccer board game that allows you to be the player as well as the coach.  You play against each other alternating as an attacker and a defender.  The attacker can select either a Fate or an Action card from draw piles.  Action cards map out actual plays with 2-6 passes and a shot on goal.  Each Action card has a number on it 5v3 or 3v3.  These numbers tell you how many dice you will be rolling against each other for each pass.  The attacker is always the first number.  If the attacker rolls a higher number it completes the pass and you go on to the next pass, if the defender rolls a higher number than the attacker the pass was not complete and the action card gets discarded and now the defender draws a Fate or Action card and becomes the attacker.  If the attacker completes all of his passes and is now at the last line on the card this is the shot on goal.  For the shot on goal the attacker and the defender only roll one die a piece to simulate the shooter and the goalkeeper.&#10;&#10;Fate cards are things that can happen during a game like red card, injuries, goalkeeper saves.  Fate cards can be used at any time to help you in your game.  The game is complete when all the action cards have been used.

745;War of Resistance;"Box description:&#10;War of Resistance is a detailed, operational level game which chronicles the second Sino-Japanese Conflict starting on July 7, 1937. Often touted as the true beginning of World War II, this 8 year war is the culmination of a decade of aggressive Japanese policy in northern and central China. The game covers the conflict through Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.&#10;The Chinese theatre is neither trivial nor inconsequential to the progress and outcome of World War II on a global scale. Over one million soldiers on each side perished. It is estimated that another 7.5 million Chinese civilians died. Over 40 million Chinese were left homeless. The vast majority of Japanese ground combat and support soldiers were engaged in China, preventing their use against the western Allies in the Pacific. America's material dominance may have been the decisive factor contributing to the Japanese demise, but Japan was already doomed to failure in the Chinese quagmire. This is essential to the greater understanding of the war in the Pacific.&#10;Western nations tend to ignore and forget the Chinese contribution to the war effort. It is an indication of western arrogance that World War II is considered to have started on September 1, 1939 and not July 7, 1937. The Chinese war effort was far from stellar, but it was enormous. The immensity of the conflict sapped the Japanese war machine to exhaustion.&#10;War of Resistance is a two-player game, with one player representing the military high command of the Japanese forces and their puppet allies, and the other the fractured Chinese military forces. The Japanese player must force the collapse of the Chinese national will to resist. The Chinese player must cling to survival until the entry of the western nations into the Pacific war ensures ultimate victory over the Japanese invaders. Both sides maneuver their forces and conduct combat in an attempt to achieve these goals.&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;&#10;    One rules booklet.&#10;    Two Orders of Battle booklets.

Each player controls a team of townsfolk, which they promote as the new leaders of Keytown. In the &lsquo;olden days&rsquo; (in the game Keydom), these teams specialized in different activities: mining, fishing, forestry, brewing, and farming. With the passing of time, the townsfolk became skilled in each of these activities. They then aspired to gain further skills and experience as churchmen, councillors, and tradesmen. With these new skills came seniority, prestige, and high standing amongst their peers.&#10;&#10;In the game, the townsfolk and their seniority are represented by numbered tiles. Keytown is played over four rounds. Each round represents a generation in the lives of the townsfolk, during which the townsfolk may work or study in the resource locations, gain new skills in the church, council, or market, or start a family in a cottage. After four generations, one of these teams is destined to emerge as the new leaders of Keytown. The winner of the game is the player whose townsfolk are collectively held in the most esteem at the end of round four.&#10;&#10;Like Keydom, contents include full colour board, printed counters, and wooden cubes.

772;Ausbrecher AG;"Seven criminals are escaping from the prison island Monte Ganovo and must reach the 4 small boats waiting for them. But the first boat is a sinking wreck whilst the fourth boat is a modern speedboat, so the seven must time their run down the path to be last, not first.

In addition, each hand is played with a variable time limit, as the dealer gets to play either a quick hand (he thinks he can get the Remmi quickly), or a longer hand.

780;Big Battle;"Described by the Publisher/Designer:&#10;&#10;M K Morrison developed Big Battle over a number of years. He fine tuned it by play testing against an international chess master in New Zealand. Big Battle is a chess variant played on a 10 by 10 chess board. It has two new pieces called Princes which combine the powers of the chess knight and the Big Battle Queen. The Big Battle queen in addition to the powers of the ordinary chess queen can also jump over an immediately adjacent piece. The pawns (called soldiers in Big Battle) can move one two or threes squares; not just on their first moves but for any move. It makes for a pretty sharp end game. Almost all the pieces in Big Battle have enhanced powers when compared to their chess counterparts. There have been a number of Big Battle tournaments in New Zealand, including two national tournaments. You can find out more about Big Battle at the Chess Variants page or at Zillions of games.

782;Win, Place & Show;"A race meeting consisting of 6 races, each with 6 horses of varying power and characteristics.  Board shows an oval track of six lanes, straightforward in straights but graduated on the curves.  Although dice play a part in the game there is plenty of room for skillful maneuvering in the course of each race, which can be from 5 furlongs to 1 1/4 miles.  An important part of the game is provided by certain marked squares: if you can get your horse to stop on one of these it can overtake one horse ahead of it in the same line, which can be vital considering that only two swerves are permitted in each turn (only one if the jockey is an apprentice).  Every horse has a distinctive racing pattern (slow or fast starter, stayer or fader etc.) represented by a set of numbers, one for each turn.  These numbers are added to a single dice throw (common to all the horses), so that the speed of each race can vary substantially.  There are many other interesting factors too numerous to describe in a short review.  Odds on each horse are pre-set and depend largely on the number patterns described above.&#10;&#10;Originally released as part of the 3M Sports Games line.&#10;&#10;";1966;6.73827;2.0842;3;6;120;8;Animals, Racing, Sports;race meeting consist race horse vary power characteristic show oval track lane straightforward straight graduate curve dice plenty room skillful maneuvering course race furlong mile important provide certain marked square horse stop overtake horse ahead line vital consider swerve permit jockey apprentice horse distinctive racing pattern slow fast starter stayer fader etc represent set number number add single dice throw common horse speed race vary substantially interesting factor numerous describe short review odd horse pre set depend largely number pattern describe originally release m sport line

When that area is complete that meeple scores points for its owner.&#10;&#10;During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&quot; or &quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, thus making it a harder for them to complete it and score points?&quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.&#10;&#10;First game in the Carcassonne series.&#10;&#10;";2000;7.41266;1.8886;2;5;45;7;Medieval, Territory Building;carcassonne tile draw place tile piece southern french landscape represent tile city road cloister grassland combination thereof place adjacent tile way city connect city road road et cetera having place tile decide place meeple area city knight road robber cloister monk field farmer area complete meeple owner carcassonne face decision like worth put meeple use tile expand city place near opponent instead make hard complete place tile option place meeple proceed quickly option possibility carcassonne series

826;Cartagena;"Cartagena takes as its theme the famous 1672 pirate-led jailbreak from the fortress of Cartagena. Each player has a group of six pirates, and you want to be the first to have all six escape through the tortuous underground passage that connects the fortress to the port, where a sloop is waiting for them.&#10;&#10;To move a pirate, you need to play a card from your hand. Each card bears one of six symbols (dagger, pirate hat, etc.), and when you play a card, you move one of your pirates forward to the next matching symbol in the tunnel, leapfrogging over matching symbols where another pirate already stands. The only way to get more cards, however, is to move backwards; more specifically, you move one of your pirates backwards to the first space that holds one or two pirates, drawing one or two cards after doing so. Each turn, you take 1-3 actions, whether moving forward or backward or both.&#10;&#10;When you move a pirate to the end of the track, it jumps on the sloop where it must await the other pirates in its crew. With every step toward victory, though, you have fewer and fewer pirates to move each turn, possibly locking you in to actions you don't want, so be sure to plan ahead and not leave yourself empty-handed!&#10;&#10;";2000;6.68076;1.5987;2;5;45;8;Nautical, Pirates;cartagena take famous pirate lead jailbreak fortress cartagena group pirate want escape tortuous underground passage connect fortress port sloop wait pirate need card hand card bear symbol dagger pirate hat etc card pirate forward matching symbol tunnel leapfrogging matching symbol pirate stand way card backwards specifically pirate backwards space hold pirate draw card action forward backward pirate end track jump sloop await pirate crew step few few pirate possibly lock action don t want sure plan ahead leave hand

840;Corsairs;"Corsairs is essentially a card game where players attempt to assemble the correct combination of provisions in order to be able to board galleys, whilst possessing a strong enough crew in order to board the ship and fend off their opponents potential counterattacks. The game comes with 30 galleys tiles in five different colors. Four of these galleys are placed face-up on the table and are ripe for the taking. Each galley indicates the combination of provisions which must be played before a player can attempt to board it. In addition, each galley indicates the victory points it is worth, as well as the 'boarding' strength, which must be met or exceeded for it to fall prey to the pirates.&#10;&#10;Players are each dealt an initial hand of six cards, most of which depict one of six different types of provisions (water, bread, meat, rum, bananas or beans). In addition, several cards depict corsairs (pirates) with values ranging from 2 - 4.&#10;&#10;On their turn, players must play 3 cards. They may play them:&#10;&#10;a) beside a galley to begin amassing provision cards so as to eventually match the provision requirements indicated on the galley. &#10;b) to the discard pile, replacing them with cards chosen from rummaging through the discard pile&#10;c) 'fire a broadside' by playing any card to the discard pile and rolling dice. He may then steal matching provisions placed by the galley by other players.&#10;&#10;Once a player assembles all of the necessary provisions, he can attempt to board the ship. He needs to have enough corsairs, to add to the roll of two dice to beat the boarding value of the galley. Other players may also attempt to board the galley at the same time, and the one with the highest boarding value wins it. The others lose all the cards played next to the galley. A new galley is then made available.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player with most VP from galleys boarded.&#10;&#10;(precis from the review by gschloesser)&#10;&#10;";2000;6.05788;1.6667;2;4;60;10;Card Game, Fighting, Nautical, Pirates;corsairs essentially card attempt assemble correct combination provision order able galley whilst possess strong crew order ship fend opponent potential counterattack come galley tile different color galley place face table ripe taking galley indicate combination provision attempt addition galley indicate worth boarding strength meet exceed fall prey pirate deal initial hand card depict different provision water bread meat rum banana bean addition card depict corsair pirate value range card galley begin amass provision card eventually match provision requirement indicate galley b discard pile replace card choose rummage discard pile c fire broadside card discard pile rolling dice steal matching provision place galley assemble necessary provision attempt ship need corsair add dice beat boarding value galley attempt galley time high boarding value card galley new galley available winner vp galley boarded precis review gschloesser

848;Tip Tap;"In TohuWabohu, a.k.a. Tip Tap, players must race to finger the right items on the table &mdash; but winning an item isn't good enough as you need to protect it from being stolen while still hunting for more.&#10;&#10;In more detail, you set up the game by placing all of the multi-colored and strangely shaped cardboard bits on the table. Each round, one player is the director and takes charge of flipping over a card that depicts one or more of these bits. Everyone races to place a finger on the depicted items first, and once you've placed a finger on an item, you can't move it again. Once all the depicted items are found (assuming they were correctly figured), the fingerers place those items in front of themselves, then the director flips another card. If a card shows an item previously claimed, the owner of that item must secure it with a finger; if they don't, any opponent who touches it first will steal it away.&#10;&#10;If a player has seven or eight bits in front of them, then the round ends and everyone scores one point for each item that they collected. After playing as many rounds as the number of players, the game ends and whoever has scored the most points wins.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.79228;1.0;3;6;45;7;Party Game, Real-time;tohuwabohu k tip tap race finger right item table mdash item isn t good need protect steal hunt detail set place multi color strangely shape cardboard bit table director take charge card depict bit race place finger depict item ve place finger item t depict item find assume correctly figure fingerer place item director card card show item previously claim owner item secure finger don t opponent touch steal away seven bit end item collect number end

854;Doge;"Three or four players try to gain the most influence by building palazzos in Venice. Influence is placed face-down into city sections. When all is placed, they are revealed in a predetermined order. Having the most influence in a section allows a player to build the most houses and also give control over the adviser for that section. The adviser can be placed somewhere else in the city and adds influence in a later vote. Houses can be traded for Palazzos, and the player with 6, 7 or 8 Palazzos in 6, 5 or 4 city sections is the winner.&#10;&#10;Part of the Goldsieber large box series&#10;&#10;";2000;6.52131;2.5467;3;4;45;12;Bluffing, Political;try gain influence build palazzos venice influence place face city section place reveal predetermine order have influence section allow build house adviser section adviser place city add influence later vote house trade palazzo palazzo city section winner goldsieber large box series

The object of the game is to build up the New York skyline, consisting of twelve numbered sections.    Each section has four pieces, one in each colour - 48 tiles in all.   Each player has a colour for which they will score.   You start with a hand of six tiles, a &ldquo;draw pool&rdquo; of six face-up, and the rest face-down.   On your turn; you lay a tile, you replace from the draw pool, you replenish the draw pool.   The game continues until all the tiles are laid; though you can stop laying tiles if you want (to &ldquo;protect&rdquo; some of your own colours on show), but once you&rsquo;ve stopped, that&rsquo;s it, and other players can still lay theirs.   At the end, you score for any face-up tile of your colour, with bonuses for getting tiles adjacent.&#10;&#10;";1989;5.82528;1.2857;2;4;30;8;City Building;tile lay sort see card rsquo ldquo card rdquo narrow tall impossible shuffle rsquo back heavy card object build new york skyline consist numbered section section piece colour tile colour start hand tile ldquo draw pool rdquo face rest face lay tile replace draw pool replenish draw pool continue tile lay stop lay tile want ldquo protect rdquo colour rsquo ve stop rsquo lay theirs end face tile colour bonus get tile adjacent
858;Blindes Huhn;"A simple trick-taking game where you are trying to avoid collecting the Blind Hens. The cards are numbered 0-59 and are all dealt out (use a reduced deck with fewer players). Players then take time to sort out their hand as they want to play it. When everybody has fixed their hand, the first trick is lead. You may only play a card from either END of your hand, you may NOT re-order your hand or choose from the middle. Score the tricks you won. Each card with a Blind Hen has some eggs on it, the eggs count against you - minus one point each. But if a trick has more than one Blind Hen in it, you total the Hens and multiply with the total eggs to give the score for that trick.&#10;&#10;";1997;5.31882;1.125;3;6;20;8;Card Game;simple trick taking try avoid collect blind hen card number deal use reduce deck few time sort hand want everybody fix hand trick lead card end hand order hand choose middle trick card blind hen egg egg count minus trick blind hen total hen multiply total egg trick
860;Scotland the Brave;"from Consimworld:&#10;&#10;The Situation&#10;There is no greater hero in Scottish history than William Wallace. In 1297 he began what grew into the Scottish Rebellion. The death of his wife at the hands of the English launched Wallace on a quest to expel them from Scotland. Unlike other leaders in the rebellion, Wallace never betrayed his country, his comrades or his cause.&#10;&#10;The Game&#10;SCOTLAND THE BRAVE is based on the opening of the Scottish War for Independence. Beginning with the revolt of a minor land owner named William Wallace in 1297, it culminated in the victory of Robert the Bruce in 1315 at Bannockburn. SCOTLAND THE BRAVE simulates the first two years of the conflict in which William Wallace was the dominant figure. Players take the place of either William Wallace or King Edward of England as each attempts to gain the assistance of Scottish nobles and control of southern Scotland.&#10;&#10;SCOTLAND THE BRAVE originally appeared in issue no. 49 of Shadis Magazine. This Avalanche Press Edition features different components, complete with mounted mapsheet, and new rules. This is a fast-playing game which can be learned and played in a single sitting.

864;Mage Knight;"WizKids' first game, Mage Knight cleverly applies the CCG concept to miniatures; a &quot;Starter Pack&quot; contains 10 random pre-painted, plastic miniatures, while &quot;Booster Packs&quot; contain 5. Figures' stats are kept track of via dials on their bases, which change depending on how much damage they've taken.&#10;&#10;As in most miniatures games, players each create an army with the same number of points (with each miniature having a different point value), then take turns moving and attacking until all of the opponent's forces are dead or captured, the opponent withdraws, or your pre-determined time limit expires.&#10;&#10;The same figures could be used in two other games:&#10;&#10;    Mage Knight Conquest&#10;    Mage Knight Dungeons&#10;&#10;&#10;Mage Knight 2.0&#10;&#10;Mage Knight 2.0 changed many rules which overhauled or expanded, they introduced new strategic possibilities to the game, including capabilities to customize Unique warriors and battles via styrene cards called Items, Domains, and Constructed Terrain.&#10;&#10;Later expansions introduced more options via Spellbooks, Spells, and Adventuring Companies.&#10;&#10;It was eventually counted as a new game since the old figures were ruled obsolete for all tournaments that utilized the Mage Knight 2.0 format.&#10;&#10;The two &quot;versions&quot; can be distinguished by their logos; the original Mage Knight sets feature a straight short sword through the logo while &quot;2.0&quot; and its subsequent expansions have a curved scimitar.&#10;&#10;";2000;6.21952;2.382;2;4;60;10;Collectible Components, Fantasy, Miniatures, Wargame;wizkids mage knight cleverly apply ccg concept miniature starter pack contain random pre paint plastic miniature booster packs contain figure stat keep track dial basis change depend damage ve take miniature create army number miniature have different value attack opponent force dead capture opponent withdraw pre determine time limit expire figure mage knight conquest mage knight dungeon mage knight mage knight change overhaul expand introduce new strategic possibility include capability customize unique warrior battle styrene card call item domain construct terrain later introduce option spellbook spell adventure company eventually count new old figure obsolete tournament utilize mage knight format distinguish logo original mage knight set straight short sword logo subsequent curved scimitar

868;Atlantis;"The sinking of Atlantis is said to have been over 11,000 years ago. Thousands of books published around the world rely on only one source: the account by the Greek philosopher Plato, who wrote of it around 350 BC.&#10;&#10;On the island of Atlantis, there was the capital city of the same name in the center along with nine other cities. The island was divided among the ten sons of Poseidon and Clito.&#10;&#10;Although the island thrived for hundreds of years, it eventually declined into tyranny and immorality. Eventually Zeus sank the island with earthquakes and floods in a single day.&#10;&#10;To win the game, the players struggle for the crown of Atlantis. The winner is the player who succeeds in entering the temple of Poseidon in the very heart of Atlantis with his crown. He becomes the new king of all Atlantis.

870;Empires of the Ancient World;"Going back to the age of Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar, you control the destiny of your empire--building armies, annexing neutral provinces, trading across the Mediterranean, and fighting battles. The heart of the game is its innovative card combat system. The full-color cards allow the use of pikes, swords, war bands, elephants, heavy cavalry, foot skirmishers, light horse, siege towers, artillery, and galleys. Special cards allow you to develop better military leaders, diplomats, traders, and engineers. However, winning the game is not just about having the largest empire. The player with the largest army will also lose the most victory points, so he had better use his forces well. If warfare is not to your taste then you can trade your way to victory, by having the largest trading empire.&#10;&#10;";2000;6.62511;2.9762;3;5;180;12;Ancient;go age alexander great julius caesar destiny empire build army annex neutral province trade mediterranean fighting battle heart innovative card combat color card allow use pike sword war band elephant heavy cavalry foot skirmisher light horse siege tower artillery galley special card allow develop well military leader diplomat trader engineer have large empire large army well use force warfare taste trade way have large trading empire

A timer is used to determine how much time one has to construct the required shape. Once you complete the required shape you turn the timer on its side. Others then have the remaining time to solve the puzzle or can work as a group to solve and get the points for solving.&#10;&#10;Shuffle the 36 task cards and 8 event cards together and placed them in the unsolved tasks area.

876;Tennis Masters;"Goldsieber attempts to capture the feel of tennis in this oddball dexterity game.  Each player has a  still tennis player figure which is used to volley the ball back and forth across the net.  Under each player, and under the translucent surface of the board is the movement paddle for that player, which dictates how far the playing figure could move for the subsequent turn.  The game field is set up just like a tennis court, with the requisite lines and a net, and the players volley a soft tufted &quot;tennis ball&quot;.  One player serves the ball, and if it lands within the fair territory, the receiving player checks to see if it fell within their movement paddle space.  That player then moves the center of their paddle under the ball and uses their figure to return the ball, and so on until one player scores by their opponent knocking the ball out of play, or by playing the ball in a space where their opponent cannot reach it within their movement zone.  All of the ball volleying is performed by tensing back the racket of the playing figure, and then releasing it to launch the ball across the net.  Scoring is handled just like regular tennis scoring.&#10;&#10;";2000;5.67553;1.5;2;2;40;8;Action / Dexterity, Sports;goldsieber attempt capture feel tennis oddball dexterity tennis figure volley ball forth net translucent surface paddle dictate far playing figure subsequent field set like tennis court requisite line net volley soft tufte tennis ball serve ball land fair territory receive check fall paddle space center paddle ball use figure return ball opponent knock ball ball space opponent reach zone ball volleying perform tense racket playing figure release launch ball net handle like regular tennis

884;Way Out West;"In this western themed game, players are looking to drive cattle across the west, establishing towns.  If you don't like the way something is going, you can fight other players for control with your cowboys.  You can rob the bank, rustle cattle, and shoot those pesky farmers!&#10;&#10;Gameplay:  To Start each player receives a set of colored player counters, matching turn order token, and two black action tokens and either $20 or $25 depending on number of players.  The dice are rolled to determine the start player. Each player in turn order will place one of their cowboy counters in a town box of any of the 5 towns on the map until each player has placed 3 cowboys.&#10;&#10;Each turn the players will bid for turn order, take actions and move the turn marker one space.  To bid for turn order each player places an amount of money under their turn order token in current player order.  Players may either raise or drop out.  If a player drops out all money bid so far is paid to the bank and their turn order token is placed in the furthest available spot from start player space on the turn order track.  This continues until one player remains and becomes the start player for the round.&#10;&#10;During the action phase each player will take 1 action in turn order.  After everyone has taken a turn they repeat the procedure.  The actions available are limited in number so turn order is important in doing what a player wishes to do.  Actions available are: Buy Cattle in a town containing their cowboy(s), Purchase more Cowboys, Move Cowboys to different towns, Move Cattle from one town to another, Purchase Buildings or Transport counters in a town, Take a Farmer(reduces income and victory points from Cattle in the town they are placed), or Gunfight.&#10;&#10;There are six different building and transport counters: StageCoach (these earn $1 per cowboy when cowboys are placed in or moved from the town containing the player's StageCoach), Train (this doubles the income gained from all players Cattle in the same town and doubles victory points gained from Cattle at game end),  Bank (earns its owner $2 for each building or transport counter in the same town), Store (earns the owner $1 for each Cattle counter belonging to other players in the town and $2 per Farmer counter in town),  Hotel (earns $1 for each cowboy belonging to other players in same town), Jail (the sheriff in the Jail acts as an extra cowboy controlled by owner that can be added to Gunfights). Cattle and Farmers also earn money for players during an income round.  Each Cattle counter earns its owner $2 UNLESS the town also contains a Farmer (it only earns $1 if this is the case).  Oh, the Farmer and Cowmen can't be friends.&#10;&#10;Gunfights can be started to take over another players Building or Tranport counter, rustle Cattle, rob a Bank or remove a Farmer or Jail.  The player choosing the Gunfight selects the target of the attack.  All Cowboys belonging to each player in the town will be involved.  The remaining player's Cowboys in the town are not involved. However; the owner of the Jail can choose to help themselves, if they are attacking, or they can add the Sheriff to the defender if wished.  Farmers that are attacked defend as a single cowboy.  Banks and Trains both have an intrinsic 1 Cowboy defense in addition to those in town of owner's color.  The player with the fewest Cowboys fires first and immediately removes casualties.  Each 5 or 6 rolled kills a Cowboy.  If the number of Cowboys is tied then firing is simultaneous.  A player may retreat instead of firing by moving each cowboy involved to a different town (only 1 per town) and loses the engagement.  If the attacker wins they take control of the target of the attack and may replace the counter (up to 2 counters if rustling Cattle) with one of their color (except for Banks, Farmers and Jails).  A Jail or Farmer is removed from play and a Bank is robbed.  The successful robber rolls 3 die 6 and takes that amount of money from the owner of the Bank (the Bank remains under owner's control).  If the owner of the Bank cannot pay the full amount (then pays all they have to the robber and the Bank is removed).  Each time a player wins a Gunfight they take a Wanted Counter.  If none remain they take it from another player their of choice.&#10;&#10;Victory:  After taking turns 3,6,9 and 12 income is paid to players as delineated above.  The game ends after round 12.  Victory points are awarded for each Building or Transport counter (1 point per size of town).  So a building in a Town with 4 Building or Transport Counters including itself is worth 4 points to the owning player.  Each Cattle Counter is worth one victory point for the owner.  If a train is in the town each Cattle Counter is worth 2 points.  If a Farmer is in the town Cattle are worth 1 victory point less.  To illustrate, if a Farmer is in same town Cattle counters are worthless unless a Train is also present in the town.  In this case, they would be worth 1 point each.  The player with the most Building/Transport counters and Cattle in a town is considered to control the town and scores bonus points equal to the size of the town (Cattle do not affect town size but do affect control).  The Player with most money gains 5 victory points (2 each in case of a tie).  The Player with the most Wanted counters scores 4 victory points.  The player with most Points wins.&#10;&#10;";2000;6.13047;2.6203;3;5;120;12;American West;western themed look drive cattle west establish town don t like way go fight cowboy rob bank rustle cattle shoot pesky farmer start receive set colored matching order token black action token depend number dice determine start order place cowboy town box town map place cowboy bid order action marker space bid order place money order token current order raise drop drop money bid far pay bank order token place furthest available spot start space order track continue remain start action action order take repeat procedure action available limited number order important wish action available buy cattle town contain cowboy purchase cowboy cowboy different town cattle town purchase building transport town farmer reduce income cattle town place gunfight different building transport stagecoach earn cowboy cowboy place town contain stagecoach train double income gain cattle town double gain cattle end bank earn owner building transport town store earn owner cattle belong town farmer town hotel earn cowboy belong town jail sheriff jail act extra cowboy owner add gunfight cattle farmer earn money income cattle earn owner town contain farmer earn case oh farmer cowman t friend gunfight start build tranport rustle cattle rob bank remove farmer jail choose gunfight select target attack cowboy belong town involve remain cowboy town involve owner jail choose help attack add sheriff defender wish farmer attack defend single cowboy bank train intrinsic cowboy defense addition town owner color few cowboy fire immediately remove casualty kill cowboy number cowboy tie fire simultaneous retreat instead fire cowboy involve different town town engagement attacker target attack replace rustle cattle color bank farmer jail jail farmer remove bank rob successful robber die take money owner bank bank remain owner owner bank pay pay robber bank remove time gunfight wanted remain take income pay delineate end award building transport size town building town building transport include worth own cattle worth owner train town cattle worth farmer town cattle worth illustrate farmer town cattle worthless train present town case worth building transport cattle town consider town bonus equal size town cattle affect town size affect money gain case tie want

The board has a scoring track and there is an element of swindling your opponents.&#10;&#10;From MNG-AJM Games Catalog 2005:  Players purchase shops and then enhance them and buy more shops as the game goes on.  The board shows an overhead view of a city centre around which customers wander - some normal, some big spenders and one thief. A special die is used to let you move a customer - the idea being to direct the spenders to your shops and away from those of opponents while making sure the thief stays away from your shops and goes to as many opponents' shops as possible.&#10;&#10;The game was redeveloped and published as The Market of Alturien, the first game in the Alturien series.&#10;&#10;";1988;5.59876;1.625;2;6;30;8;Economic;show view shopping parade mark shop try attract customer square track element swindle opponent mng ajm catalog purchase shop enhance buy shop go show overhead view city centre customer wander normal big spender thief special die let customer idea direct spender shop away opponent make sure thief stay away shop go opponent shop possible redevelop publish market alturien alturien series
902;Meuterer;"Meuterer is a role selection card game in which players take the roles of crewmembers aboard a merchant ship. Each round, each player reveals goods from their hands that they wish to sell. However, most ports deal in only one sort of good, and only the captain may decide where the ship goes. If a player chooses to become the mutineer, he/she will try to become captain in order to change the destination of the ship. Each player may also have an ally in the fight, and the side which played the most conflict points gets the final word on the ship's destination.&#10;&#10;The player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner. Every time a player sells more goods than the other players or reaches their destination, they score points.

904;Nightmare Productions;"Reiner Knizia's auction game about producing movies. In four rounds, players bid on chips representing genuine directors, actors, camera, effects, music, guest stars and agents (or in Nightmare Productions edition: creatures, locations, directors, musical conductors, cameos, and contractors). These all get placed on players' film-strips to complete the movie production. So one movie might need 2 actors (in editions prior to Nightmare Productions), but no music or effects and so on. As films are completed, the points value is marked and another film-strip taken. There are two parties (in Nightmare Productions edition: horror cons) each round where players get to pick from offers without paying anything. There are bonus points for first films completed and best films, best directors (in Nightmare Productions edition: best creatures), even worst film.&#10;&#10;The auction is a basic rising offer with passing until one winning bid remains. Players pay into the pot with contracts (in Nightmare Productions edition: money), and the rest of the players share the pot each turn. So it's a closed economy with players trying to time to bid on what they really need to complete films.&#10;&#10;See Movie Comparison - Traumfabrik for listings of movies and actors in each version prior to Nightmare Productions edition.&#10;&#10;Note: There have been many editions of the game under varying names.

Both players hunt each other!&#10;&#10;At first the forest lies peacefully under the face-down tiles. As the players turn the tiles over and move them on the board, the forest awakens and the hunt destroys the serenity of the forest. The lumberjacks cut swaths through the forest to provide hunting fields for the hunters. The bears then use these same aisles to track the hunters and lumberjacks.

911;Empires of the Middle Ages;"This classic SPI game from 1980 covers the economic and political landscape of Medieval Europe from 771 to 1467 on an area map.  Several scenarios allow players to do anything from a solitaire game during the Charlemagne's reign to the &quot;Grand Scenario&quot; that covers historical trends throughout the period.&#10;&#10;Decision Games published a second edition in 2004, with a differently styled map.  It added optional expansion rules &amp; counters for Armies, Fleets, and Civilization Markers, along with additional Event Cards -- raising their number from 56 to 164.&#10;&#10;At the start of each player's Round, Event Cards are drawn which change the strategic situation (such as Plague or Bounty) or benefit a player in various ways.  The descriptions of the Events contain a great deal of historical information, adding much interest to the game.&#10;&#10;Each player may attempt to perform up to five &quot;Endeavors&quot; per 25-year long Turn.&#10;&#10;There are six types of Endeavors:  Conquest, Pillage, Diplomacy, Defense, Fortification (including building Armies/Fleets) and Ruling. Additionally, moving Armies/Fleets and Taxation may always be performed.&#10;&#10;Endeavor resolution is diceless; instead &quot;Year Cards&quot; which show an array of results for each type of Endeavor are drawn.  The card might also require a Leader Stature Check, which can change the player's Combat, Administration, and Diplomacy ratings.&#10;&#10;Endeavor resolution is affected by the appropriate Leader rating, and the involved areas' language, religion, population, and Social State (which changes frequently).  Poor performance can lead to Unrest or Rebellion in an Area.&#10;&#10;An area's Social State value rises and falls as a result of Events and Endeavors, and improving the Social State of your empire is an important object of play.&#10;&#10;Optional rules add non-player Raiders and Magnates.&#10;&#10;The Sword And The Stars is a galactic empire game based on the Empires Of The Middle Age game system.&#10;&#10;";1980;7.173;3.5439;1;6;360;14;Civilization, Economic, Medieval, Political, Wargame;classic spi cover economic political landscape medieval europe area map allow solitaire charlemagne reign grand cover historical trend period decision publish second differently style map add optional amp army fleet civilization marker additional event card raise number start event card draw change strategic situation plague bounty benefit way description event contain great deal historical information add interest attempt perform endeavor year long endeavor conquest pillage diplomacy defense fortification include build army fleet additionally army fleet taxation perform endeavor resolution diceless instead year card array result endeavor draw card require leader stature check change combat administration diplomacy rating endeavor resolution affect appropriate leader rating involved area language religion population social state change frequently poor performance lead unrest rebellion area area social state value rise fall result event endeavor improve social state empire important object optional add non raider magnate sword star galactic empire base empire middle age

915;Mystery of the Abbey;"Mystery of the Abbey is a whodunit deduction game in the spirit of Clue. A monk has been murdered in a medieval French Abbey. Players maneuver their way through the Abbey examining clues and questioning each other to find out who is the culprit.&#10;&#10;Monks are of three orders, fat-thin, bald-hatted, bearded-clean shaven. One monk card is hidden, and the rest of the cards are distributed.  Turns consist of moving up to two spaces, and then asking a question of any other monks who are present there. (For instance, &quot;how many fat monks do you have?&quot;.) Players may either take a &quot;vow of silence&quot; or answer truthfully; they then in turn get to ask the accuser a question.  &quot;Mass&quot; occurs every four turns: all players go back to the Sanctuary, an event card is read, and they then pass an ever growing number of cards to their left neighbor. Various rooms have special events or cards associated with them, e.g. in a Cell you get to pick a card from a neighbor, in the Cryptorum you get to pick up a card to take an extra turn later. Unlike Clue you don't automatically win by making a correct Accusation: you get 4 points for getting it right, but you also get 2 points for each correct Declaration of a single trait, and lose points for incorrect declarations and accusations. So, e.g. a person could correctly Declare the culprit but lose the game.  Unique Events cards add randomness to each play, and the game begs for House rules to limit the questions.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.53652;2.2031;3;6;90;8;Deduction, Medieval, Murder / Mystery, Religious;mystery abbey whodunit deduction spirit clue monk murder medieval french abbey maneuver way abbey examine clue question find culprit monk order fat thin bald hat bearded clean shaven monk card hide rest card distribute consist space ask question monk present instance fat monk vow silence answer truthfully ask accuser question mass occur sanctuary event card read pass grow number card left neighbor room special event card associate e g cell pick card neighbor cryptorum pick card extra later unlike clue don t automatically make correct accusation get right correct declaration single trait incorrect declaration accusation e g person correctly declare culprit unique event card add randomness beg house limit question

923;Breakaway Rider;"Simple card game of cycle racing. Players fight to hold the yellow jersey when the race ends.&#10;&#10;Players are dealt 6 cards and draw a 7th before playing a pace card, and any additional modifiers. There are 84 pace cards numbered between 39 and 50, Spurts (which add 2 to your pace), Headwind (which subtract -2 from your pace) and Mountains (which ensure that no one can take the lead from the current player).&#10;&#10;One player starts as the race leader with a yellow token, and plays a speed card. Successive players must match the leader's pace to stay in the Peleton (the race pack), and each enjoys a +2 to their pace card simulating the benefit of decreased wind resistance.  If a player falls more than 2 behind the pack, than they draw chips (representing minutes) equal to the difference from their card and the race pace.  If a player starts his turn not in the Peleton, than he does not get the +2 slipstream bonus.&#10;&#10;If a player plays a card that is faster than the race leader, they either take the lead, or make up time until they catch the Peleton.  If they take the lead, they take the yellow token, and successive players must now match their tempo.&#10;&#10;You must play Headwinds when you draw them, and you can use Spurts as you like.  You play Mountain cards on yourself or the race leader, and they prevent anyone from passing the leader, and they also remove the 2 km slipstream bonus that other player otherwise enjoy.&#10;&#10;The race ends when the deck runs out.  The player holding the yellow token wins and scores a point, the other players lose points equal to the chips in front of them.&#10;&#10;Timing is everything if you plan to win.&#10;&#10;";1963;6.17223;1.2745;2;6;20;8;Card Game, Racing, Sports;simple card cycle racing fight hold yellow jersey race end deal card draw th pace card additional modifier pace card number spurt add pace headwind subtract pace mountain ensure lead current start race leader yellow token speed card successive match leader pace stay peleton race pack enjoy pace card simulate benefit decrease wind resistance fall pack draw chip represent minute equal difference card race pace start peleton slipstream bonus card fast race leader lead time catch peleton lead yellow token successive match tempo headwind draw use spurt like mountain card race leader prevent pass leader remove km slipstream bonus enjoy race end deck run hold yellow token equal chip time plan
925;Werewolf;"Werewolf (also known as Mafia) takes place in a small town where a minority of the townsfolk hold a dangerous secret.&#10;&#10;Each player is secretly assigned a role - Werewolf, Villager, or Seer (a special Villager). There is also a Moderator who controls the flow of the game.&#10;&#10;The game alternates between night and day phases. At night, the Werewolves secretly choose a Villager to kill. Also, the Seer (if still alive) asks whether another player is a Werewolf or not. During the day, the Villager who was killed is revealed and is out of the game. The remaining Villagers then vote on the player they suspect is a Werewolf. That player reveals his/her role and is out of the game.&#10;&#10;Werewolves win when there are an equal number of Villagers and Werewolves. Villagers win when they have killed all Werewolves.

926;CATAN: Cities & Knights;"Adds several new aspects to Settlers of Catan but the two major ones are creating knights to protect the land from invading barbarians and building city improvements that confer benefits upon that city's owner. Adds tactical complexity to the game and game length.&#10;&#10;Belongs to the Catan Series.&#10;&#10;The game changes the base game in three main ways:&#10;&#10;First, there are 3 new commodities in the game, distinct from resources - paper, cloth, and coins, which can be acquired from Forest, Meadow, and Mountain spaces, respectively. Cities that would normally produce two of one of those resources instead produce 1 resource and 1 of the corresponding commodity. (To make commodities easier to obtain, each player starts the game with 1 city and 1 settlement on the board.) These commodities allow players to build city improvements that confer various advantages and eventually points.&#10;&#10;Second, the deck of development cards is replaced by three different decks, each corresponding to one of the commodities. Building city improvements gives players a chance to draw these cards with every roll of the dice. Building more improvements will increase these chances, but cards cannot be bought directly in any way. These cards are similar to the development cards in the base game, but with a wider range of effects. (Some cards are balanced better as well - the new Resource Monopoly card, for example, can take no more than 2 of the named resource from any one player.)&#10;&#10;Finally, players can also build knights on the island along their network of roads. These knights can be used to claim certain intersections and move the Robber (taking the place of Soldier cards), but are also used to defend the island from periodic barbarian attacks. If the island is successfully defended, the player(s) with the most knights are rewarded. If not, the player(s) with the fewest knights each have a city downgraded to a settlement.&#10;&#10;";1998;7.44983;2.8949;3;4;150;12;Expansion for Base-game, Medieval, Negotiation;add new aspect settler catan major one create knight protect land invade barbarian build city improvement confer benefit city owner add tactical complexity length belong catan series change base main way new commodity distinct resource paper cloth coin acquire forest meadow mountain space respectively city normally produce resource instead produce resource corresponding commodity commodity easy obtain start city settlement commodity allow build city improvement confer advantage eventually second deck development card replace different deck correspond commodity build city improvement give chance draw card dice build improvement increase chance card buy directly way card similar development card base wide range effect card balance well new resource monopoly card example name resource finally build knight island network road knight claim certain intersection robber take place soldier card defend island periodic barbarian attack island successfully defend knight reward few knight city downgrade settlement
927;Lift Off;"In Lift-off, players rush to allocate resources for planetary missions.  Each planet is contested by two players, either (or both) of whom can add cards representing, for example, settlers, energy modules, terraforming, or mining to their side.  A given planet may provide mineral resources and a number of settlement points -- the minerals can be collected for victory points, and if the planet is sufficiently terraformed, the settlement points go to whichever player sent the most settlers.&#10;&#10;";2000;5.08916;1.3571;2;4;30;8;Card Game, Real-time, Science Fiction;lift rush allocate resource planetary mission planet contest add card represent example settler energy module terraforme mining give planet provide mineral resource number settlement mineral collect planet sufficiently terraforme settlement whichever send settler
928;GerÃ¼chtekÃ¼che;"In &quot;Gossip Kitchen,&quot; players attempt to sort through the truth of the many rumors flying around. The deck consists of 10 types of rumors (each with its own symbol, such as a heart) with six cards each, for a total of 60 cards. To begin, one card is removed from play and all the remaining cards dealt out (distribution may be uneven). Players now seek to collect full sets of six rumor cards and deduce which rumor set is missing a card. Players ask another about their hand, e.g. &quot;Do you have three hearts?&quot; Players need only respond with an answer of &quot;more&quot; or &quot;less&quot; if the&#10;number asked is incorrect, and play passes clockwise from the asking player. If the number asked is correct, the questioner receives those cards and play passes to the&#10;answering player. Sets of six rumors collected are placed on the table and score three points. At any point, a player may guess which rumor group is missing, scoring 10 points &#10;for a correct guess and taking a penalty of 5 points for an incorrect guess.&#10;&#10;";2000;5.06333;1.1667;3;7;20;7;Card Game, Deduction;gossip kitchen attempt sort truth rumor fly deck consist rumor symbol heart card total card begin card remove remain card deal distribution uneven seek collect set rumor card deduce rumor set miss card ask hand e g heart need respond answer number ask incorrect pass clockwise ask number ask correct questioner receive card pass answer set rumor collect place table guess rumor group miss correct guess take penalty incorrect guess
929;The Great Dalmuti;"A light card game where players gain status by going out first.&#10;&#10;The 80-card commercial deck contains cards ranked from 12 to 1, along with two Jesters. Each card bears a number, which is not only its rank, but also tells you how many of that card exist in the deck. In other words, there are twelve 12s, eleven 11s, four 4s and a single card ranked 1. The lower the number, the better the rank.&#10;&#10;The deck is dealt out to all players and the object is to get rid of your cards as fast as possible. The hand begins with one person playing one or more card to the center of the table. The cards played must all be of the same rank (although Jesters are wild, and may be played with any other cards). Each player in turn must now either play the same number of cards of a better rank, or pass. Play continues around the table until everyone has passed; at that point, the cards are cleared and whoever played the last set of cards leads the next round. After everyone has gone out, the players are ranked. For example, the person who first got rid of all his cards becomes The Great Dalmuti. Players change seat position to represent the new hierarchy and begin another round.  The Great Dalmuti is generally played for many rounds.&#10;&#10;It is a commercial version of the traditional playing card game President (based on the Chinese game Zheng Shang Yu), which has also been reimagined as:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Dilbert: Corporate Shuffle&#10;    Pyramid Card &#10;    Scum: The Food Chain Game &#10;    Deathtrap Dungeon: Card Game&#10;&#10;&#10;";1995;6.59242;1.2857;4;8;60;8;Card Game, Medieval;light card gain status go card commercial deck contain card rank jester card bear number rank tell card exist deck word single card rank low number well rank deck deal object rid card fast possible hand begin person card center table card rank jester wild card number card well rank pass continue table pass card clear set card lead go rank example person get rid card great dalmuti change seat position represent new hierarchy begin great dalmuti generally commercial traditional playing card president base chinese zheng shang yu reimagine dilbert corporate shuffle pyramid card scum food chain deathtrap dungeon card
930;BÃ¶se Buben;"Players play cards onto five lanes of a race track. As soon as there are four goblins in a particular lane, a fight breaks out and the first goblin card played in that lane is ejected from the race. Each additional card in a lane causes another goblin to drop out and as soon as four goblins from one of the five lanes have dropped out the race finishes. Each lane is then scored separately, with the player who has the highest valued goblin or goblins in that lane winning 3 Ducats.

931;Corner;"From the back of the box:&#10;&#10;Luck as well as strategy are important in this game. It starts out with the board filled with 36 coloured marbles in random distribution. Move by move players pick up marbles, trying to collect colours. Colour sets score higher!&#10;&#10;1. Each players has an arrow at the edge of the board, which he moves.&#10;&#10;2. The players take the marble which is at the intersection of the two arrows.&#10;&#10;3. This is the table of points: the higher the number of marbles in one colour, the higher the score!&#10;&#10;4.

If you place advanced RACE, you can also make money by betting!&#10;&#10;This game is based on running and betting;&#10;Each player gets 200.000 credits and the deck of &quot;Speed cards&quot; is shuffled and divided among the players, who now sort out the cards in the order they want.&#10;Now the &quot;Contestants cards&quot; are stacked face down. Each card matches the colours of the player pawns (Red, Yellow, Blue, Green, Purple and White). Now there will be an auction of the cards, where you figure our what to buy by the help of your &quot;Speed cards&quot;. Each bidding starts with 10.000 credits and is raised by 10.000 credits. All players have to have at least one (1) &quot;Contestant card&quot;.&#10;&#10;The last player to buy a card starts, and plays a &quot;Speed card&quot; to move all the pawns as the card shows; a pawn can only be moved ahead; either straight or diagonally; never backwards or sideways. Only one pawn is allowed on a spot, and it is NOT allowed to jump over another pawn.&#10;An example of a Speed card could be:&#10;Blue: 6 spaces&#10;White 4  - &#10;Black (means joker/free choice that is not on the card): 2 -&#10;Yellow: 1 -&#10;The speed cards also include &quot;Sprints&quot; and &quot;Injury&quot;&#10;&#10;The player who's colour is first over the finish line gets 200.000 in price money.

934;Die Kette von Saba;"extrapolated from session report:&#10;&#10;The theme of the game is based on the legendary necklace of Saba, which went to the grave with its owner upon her death. Sadly, dastardly grave robbers plundered the tomb and the valuable gems which comprised the necklace were scattered across the globe. Now, a wealthy sheik is anxious to reassemble the necklace and present it as a gift to his lovely bride. Players are charged with the task of assisting the sheik, attempting to purchase the many gems at auction and then reassemble the necklace in the proper fashion.&#10;&#10;The board depicts the frame of the necklace, with space for its 36 missing gems. In total, there are 44 gems in the deck, many of which will ultimately prove to be forgeries. Depending upon the number of players, each player receives from 3 - 7 gems to begin the game, along with $20,000. Four gems are revealed from the remainder of the deck and positioned into the frame.&#10;&#10;The game is played in two major phases. During the first phase, players alternate placing a gem up for auction, ala Modern Art. The auctioneer receives the funds from the high bidder, who receives the gem. The winner has the option of keeping the gem, or placing it into the frame. If placed in the frame, the gem earns $2,000 for other gems it touches and those radiating from it in straight lines, including itself. During phase 2, the reward is reduced to only $1,000 per gem.&#10;&#10;Following an auction, the auctioneer has the opportunity to purchase another gem from the deck for $2,000.  &#10;Phase 1 ends when the gem deck expires. Phase 2 then begins with players reconstructing the necklace. In turn, each player places a gem into the frame and earns funds as described above.&#10;&#10;The twist in the game are the rules which must be followed in reconstructing the necklace. The main rules are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The necklace must be symmetrical, with left and right halves containing the same jewels in the same places. All cards appear twice in the game, so what appears on the left side must appear in the same position on the right side. The only exception to this is the center column. Any duplicate pieces are considered forgeries and are worthless. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Pieces of jewelry containing the same type of gem must be placed in uniform columns. Thus, the first gem placed in a column dictates what kind of gem must appear in that same column. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     The number of gems on a card can only be one greater than the number of gems on the cards directly above it. &#10;&#10;&#10;Once the first gem is placed in a column, it 'locks' that column AND the corresponding symmetrical column. Only gems which meet the above rules can subsequently be placed there.&#10;&#10;The game ends once the necklace is completed. The player with the most money is victorious.&#10;&#10;";1984;5.38295;1.4;3;7;60;8;Economic;extrapolate session report base legendary necklace saba go grave owner death sadly dastardly grave robber plunder tomb valuable gem comprise necklace scatter globe wealthy sheik anxious reassemble necklace present gift lovely bride charge task assist sheik attempt purchase gem auction reassemble necklace proper fashion depict frame necklace space miss gem total gem deck ultimately prove forgery depend number receive gem begin gem reveal remainder deck position frame major alternate place gem auction ala modern art auctioneer receive fund high bidder receive gem winner option keep gem place frame place frame gem earn gem touch radiate straight line include reward reduce gem follow auction auctioneer opportunity purchase gem deck end gem deck expire begin reconstruct necklace place gem frame earn fund describe twist follow reconstruct necklace main necklace symmetrical left right half contain jewel place card appear twice appear left appear position right exception center column duplicate piece consider forgery worthless piece jewelry contain gem place uniform column gem place column dictate kind gem appear column number gem card great number gem card directly gem place column lock column correspond symmetrical column gem meet subsequently place end necklace complete money victorious

One player secretly controls Dracula while the other three players are Vampire hunters cooperating to locate and defeat him.&#10;&#10;Dracula must move around the countryside, evading the hunters while leaving minions and encounters for them to uncover in his wake. If he can hide six new Vampires in Europe without the hunters destroying them, the dark prince will be declared victorious and rule the day!&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, the hunters try to locate and destroy Dracula before he succeeds in raising an empire of undead Vampires.

937;1825 Unit 1;"1825 is Francis Tresham's &quot;1829 revised&quot; 18xx game. It is released in 3 distinct modules, or units. 1825 Unit 1 and 1825 Unit 2 broadly cover the same area as the 1829 southern board. 1825 Unit 3 covers most of the remainder of England and Scotland, and with unit 2 will cover the same area as the 1829 northern board. Along with the units are a number of expansion kits, which introduce extra money, trains, tiles, companies, and phases. There are currently three, and will be four regional kits, which cover areas of England, Scotland and Wales not included in the three base units.&#10;&#10;The rules are largely 1829 with improvements. Survey parties are now optional, and track is built in much the same way as most other 18xx titles. The stock market is largely the same, but multiple leaps up the market are allowed if dividends are high enough. Trains can now run to, but not through tokened out stations, and company shares become available in &quot;bands&quot; of the same value. All shares in each band become available when one of the companies in the previous band is sold out.&#10;&#10;Play time varies enormously, depending on how much of the game you play. A single unit on its own will last 1 1/2 to 3 hours, and accommodate 2-4 or so players. Multiple units and expansions add to both the number of players and the playing time. Two units and all the expansions should accommodate 3-6 players (7 max. officially) and last for anything from 4 to 8 hours. All three units will work for 4-9 players, and a fair amount longer.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.8224;3.56;2;5;180;14;Trains, Transportation;francis tresham revise xx release distinct module unit unit unit broadly cover area southern unit cover remainder england scotland unit cover area northern unit number kit introduce extra money train tile company currently regional kit cover area england scotland wale include base unit largely improvement survey party optional track build way xx title stock market largely multiple leap market allow dividend high train run tokene station company share available band value share band available company previous band sell time vary enormously depend single unit hour accommodate multiple unit add number playing time unit accommodate max officially hour unit work fair long

The action is driven by two decks of cards for each side.  Each turn, each side simultaneously chooses four action cards from a hand of ten, and places them in order.  The actions are then carried out one at a time, alternating sides.

940;Karawane;"In the 13th century, emperor Kublai Khan - successor to the legendary Chenghis Khan - reigned over East Asia. In those times, a competition was held annually, the purpose of which was to find out who was the cleverest and best camel driver in the realm.&#10;&#10;Karawane is for 3-5 players who are involved in a camel race. The object is to bid a limited supply of water chips each round to move your camel across the land to make it to certain oasis spots.

941;Turbo Taxi;"Flickwerk is a neat little competitive puzzle game, similar in feel to Ricochet Robot. With multiple sets, even more players can participate in the same game.&#10;&#10;Each player has an identical set of 12 tiles displaying part of a network of computer cables. A further set is shuffled and placed face down in the centre of a 3x3 grid, representing the nine rooms through which the cabling will flow. Four markers are placed around the edge of the grid and these represent the only points at which the cabling can leave the grid. The top card of the centre pile is turned over and players have to re-arrange their own tiles in front of them to form a valid network, using the same centre tile as displayed and connecting up the four &ldquo;perimeter&rdquo; markers. First one to complete a valid network wins the centre tile (1 VP). He then rearranges the perimeter markers if he wishes and turns over the next card to be played for.&#10;&#10;The updated edition, Turbo Taxi, features city streets rather than computer cables. The markers on the edge of the grid are a yellow taxi, yellow house, black taxi and black house. Players must ensure that their tiles create valid routes leading the yellow taxi to the yellow house, and black taxi to the black house.&#10;&#10;This game can also be played solo as you try to complete a grid in the least amount of time.&#10;&#10;The contents of Turbo Taxi is:&#10;&#10;1 rulebook (the number may vary for multilanguage editions)&#10;1 city board&#10;&#10;60 cardboard tiles:&#10;&#10;     12 green player&#10;     12 yellow player&#10;     12 blue player&#10;     12 orange player&#10;     12 neutral (with a medal in its back)&#10;&#10;&#10;4 wooden pawns&#10;&#10;     2 black pawns&#10;     2 yellow pawns&#10;&#10;&#10;";2000;6.06397;1.4711;2;4;30;8;Puzzle, Real-time;flickwerk neat little competitive puzzle similar feel ricochet robot multiple set participate identical set tile display network computer cable set shuffle place face centre x grid represent room cabling flow marker place edge grid represent cabling leave grid card centre pile arrange tile form valid network centre tile display connect ldquo perimeter rdquo marker complete valid network centre tile vp rearrange perimeter marker wish card update turbo taxi city street computer cable marker edge grid yellow taxi yellow house black taxi black house ensure tile create valid route lead yellow taxi yellow house black taxi black house solo try complete grid time content turbo taxi rulebook number vary multilanguage city cardboard tile green yellow blue orange neutral medal wooden pawn black pawn yellow pawn

943;Ligretto;"In Ligretto, each player has their own deck of forty cards, with cards 1-10 in four colors and a unique symbol on the back to identify which cards are theirs. At the start of each round, each player lays out 3-5 cards (depending on the number of players) face up in front of them to create their row; places a face-up stack of ten cards, seeing only the top card, next to their row to create their Ligretto stack; and holds the remaining cards in hand face down.&#10;&#10;Playing at the same time, each player tries to empty their Ligretto stack. If a player has a 1 card on top of any face-up stack, they play it to the center of the table. If they have a 2 card of the same color as any 1 in the center of the table, they can place the 2 card on the 1. All cards in the central piles must be played in ascending order and must be the same color.&#10;&#10;If a player can't play anything, they can reveal cards from the stack in their hand, counting them out in groups of three, then laying them face up while revealing only the top card. They can play this top card onto a central pile as long as the rules for doing so are met.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player empties their Ligretto stack, the round ends. Each player scores 1 point for each of their cards among the central piles, then loses 2 points for each card remaining in their Ligretto stack. In some versions of the game, the player with the highest score wins; in other versions, players then sort all the cards and play another round, with the first player to reach 99 points winning.&#10;&#10;A rules variant for Ligretto allows a player to play cards from their Ligretto stack or the cards in hand onto the cards in their row, but only if the numbers are in descending order and the colors of adjacent cards are not identical.&#10;&#10;";1988;6.19382;1.1693;2;4;10;8;Card Game, Real-time;ligretto deck card card color unique symbol identify card theirs start lay card depend number face create row place face card see card row create ligretto hold remain card hand face time try ligretto card face center table card color center table place card card central pile ascend order color t reveal card hand count group lay face reveal card card central pile long meet soon empty ligretto end card central pile card remain ligretto high sort card reach ligretto allow card ligretto card hand card row number descend order color adjacent card identical
944;MagÂ·Blast;"Mag-Blast is a space-themed card game in which each player tries to blast the other players from the universe. Each player assumes command of a race of beings whose powers are signified by the Flag Ship card at the center of their battle formation. The Flag Ship is surrounded on four sides with attack ships from the Ship Yard, up to 3 ships per side. On your turn you discard cards, draw back up to five, call for reinforcing ships (by playing combinations of 3 cards), and then play as many attack and defense cards as possible. Once you blast away an opponent's outer ship protection, you may attack his Flag Ship, hopefully destroying it, and eliminating it from the game.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Mag&#194;&#183;Blast (Second Edition)&#10;    Mag&#194;&#183;Blast: Third Edition&#10;&#10;&#10;";1998;5.94847;1.5789;2;6;60;10;Adventure, Card Game, Fighting, Humor, Science Fiction;mag blast space card try blast universe assume command race being power signify flag ship card center battle formation flag ship surround side attack ship ship yard ship discard card draw reinforce ship combination card attack defense card possible blast away opponent outer ship protection attack flag ship hopefully destroy eliminate implement mag blast second mag blast
945;Nametrain;"From the Designer/Publisher:&#10;&#10;Like most games the main objective is to try and be the first to finish, you do this by traveling around the game board (using names as your fuel), collecting one passenger from each of the following six categories, then taking them to the main central station to complete the Nametrain&trade;!&#10;&#10;Music.. &#10;Any group or Musician as long as they are known as the recording artist&#10;&#10;Television..&#10;Any TV program, but no using films shown on TV.&#10;&#10;Film..&#10;Any film whether it has been shown on the big screen, video or T.V.&#10;&#10;Sport.. &#10;Any sports person, male or female.&#10;&#10;Actor/Actress.. &#10;Any actor or actress from TV, stage or film&#10;&#10;Well Known People..&#10;A category for those that don't fall into any of the other categories.&#10;&#10;Playing the game&#10;To play Nametrain&trade; is very simple, somebody says a name from one of the six categories (listed above) and the last letter of that name is then used as the starting letter of the next. Each player then takes it in turn to roll the number dice and move their train along the allotted spaces, they must then give an answer from the category they land on using the last letter from the previous players answer as the starting letter of their answer...and so on.&#10;&#10;For example&#10;The game is in full flow and it's your turn, the player to your right has left you on an 'E' by saying Bruce leE (they were on the actor/actress square).

You only have 60 seconds to say the name of a group or singer whose name begins with an 'E'.&#10;&#10;Who do you say...the sands of time are slipping away...if you don't say a name soon you will lose one of your passengers, there's only a few seconds left...what about Elvis presleY.

949;Twixt;"Twixt is a 2-player abstract game invented by Alex Randolph. TwixT is a &quot;connection-type&quot; game, very similar to Hex. Other related games are Havannah and The Game of Y. &quot;Connection type&quot; means the object is to form a path connecting something to something else. This requires very different thinking from the standard battle-type game such as chess or checkers.&#10;&#10;Some old US sets mention a 4-player variant, with 2 teams as in Bridge, but this probably wasn't Randolph's idea.  The game was popular in the 60s and 70s as part of the 3M Bookshelf Series. Avalon Hill then acquired the series and issued the game themselves. Several European publishers have sold the game as well.&#10;&#10;Twixt employs a pegboard, pegs and links.  The playing surface is a 24x24 square pegboard, usually minus the corner holes, with two opposite sides marked with one player's color and the other two sides marked with the other player's color.  Each player has a supply of pegs and links of their color.  50 of each piece type of each color, a total of 200, is an ample supply. Players alternate turns placing pegs and links, if possible, in attempt to have a continuous path of links connecting the two sides of the board with their color.&#10;&#10;After the 3M edition, Randolph added the pie rule. After the first peg is placed, the opponent has the option to swap sides. This reduces the imbalance from the first move advantage.&#10;&#10;On your turn you place one peg of your color on the board, and then add or rearrange your color links. Pegs may be placed in any vacant hole in the board except the corners and the last row on the sides of the opposing player. When two pegs of the same color are at opposite corners of a six hole rectangle (3x2 or 2x3), a link may be placed between those two pegs.  Links may not be placed such that they cross other links.

950;Four Dragons;"From the designer Frank Branham: A 4 player partnership trick taking game themed around the Mexican Day of the Dead. (A particular favorite holiday of ours, as Sandi and I were married on that day in Marietta Confederate Cemetery.) It is short (about 30 minutes), and rather brain bending.&#10;&#10;Dia De Los Muertos (Day Of The Dead) is played over three days as you send animals, then children, then adults on to the afterlife. It is a basic trick taking game, except that most cards have an action with them. You play as a partnership, and if your side wins scoring cards (the dead or food), you exchange a card with your opponent. Other cards allow swaps between partners, asking a question, cancelling other cards and so on.&#10;&#10;The first time you play, there's a lot of checking the rules, checking the crib sheet, remembering if you exchange cards. You spend more time figuring the game than playing the tricks. But after a couple of hands, it makes sense and you switch to game-playing mode. And here's where it pays. If you enjoy Bridge, you can figure out what your partner signals when they swap a card, or you can read the deck based on what's been played, you will really enjoy Dia De Los Muertos. If you don't like Bridge, or can't figure trick-taking games anyway, steer well clear. It is rather brain-bending.&#10;&#10;The original game has nice native graphics of the dead abroad and has a variant for 3 players. The re-issue as Four Dragons has an oriental theme.&#10;&#10;Not to be confused with:&#10;&#10;     Dia de los Muertos (2007)&#10;     Dia de los Muertos (2016)&#10;&#10;&#10;";2000;6.56546;2.3556;3;4;30;12;Card Game, Deduction, Horror;designer frank branham partnership trick taking mexican day dead particular favorite holiday sandi marry day marietta confederate cemetery short minute brain bend dia de los muertos day dead day send animal child adult afterlife basic trick taking card action partnership card dead food exchange card opponent card allow swap partner ask question cancel card time lot check check crib sheet remembering exchange card spend time figure trick couple hand make sense switch pay enjoy bridge figure partner signal swap card read deck base enjoy dia de los muertos don t like bridge t figure trick taking steer clear brain bend original nice native graphic dead abroad issue dragon oriental confuse dia de los muertos dia de los muertos
951;Football Strategy;"Football Strategy boils the sport down to play calling skill. The game's structure is simple: The defensive player selects one of 10 formation cards (ranging from an 8-man line &quot;goal line stand&quot; to a pass prevent defense with five safeties); the offensive player calls a play (a choice of 20, plus punting). Cross-indexing the choices on a matrix shows what happened. Except for &quot;long gains&quot;, the outcome of each play against each defense is always the same. Dice are rolled only to determine the distance of long gains and the results of kickoffs and field goal attempts.&#10;&#10;Each play consumes a prescribed number of seconds, from 15 to 45. The players mark off the time and play four quarters, following the standard football rules.&#10;&#10;For variety, three types of offense (&quot;pro style&quot;, &quot;aerial game&quot; and &quot;ball control&quot;) are available, each with a different, though not radically different, results matrix.&#10;&#10;Simple though it is, the game is engrossing (see the &quot;More Information&quot; screen), and play generally follows realistic patterns, though the handling of punts and on-side kicks (both more effective than in real life) is questionable. Also, because the design changed little after its debut in 1959, the plays and defenses don't reflect the state of the art in contemporary professional football. This is the era of Otto Graham, not Eli Manning.&#10;&#10;For those who are so inclined, Football Strategy lends itself to mathematical analysis. Many years ago, an entrant into the tournament at Origins went to the trouble of using game theory to generate charts showing the optimal mix of plays in different situations. He reached the finals but, in a victory for human intuition over number crunching, lost the championship game by a touchdown and a field goal.&#10;&#10;";1959;6.43717;1.5526;2;4;150;10;Bluffing, Sports;football strategy boil sport call skill structure simple defensive select formation card range man line line stand pass prevent defense safety offensive call plus punt cross index matrix show happen long gain outcome defense dice determine distance long gain result kickoff field attempt consume prescribed number second mark time quarter follow standard football variety offense pro style aerial ball available different radically different result matrix simple engross information screen generally follow realistic pattern handling punt kick effective real life questionable change little debut defense don t reflect state art contemporary professional football era otto graham eli man incline football strategy lend mathematical analysis year ago entrant tournament origin go trouble theory generate chart show optimal mix different situation reach final human intuition number crunch championship touchdown field

959;Luftschiff;"Solitaire game of German Zeppelin operations in WWI that plays like a really sophisticated side-scrolling arcade game. The board shows a side view of the airspace over war-torn Europe (or in one scenario, Africa). The counter representing your Zeppelin remains in a central &quot;Zeppelin corridor,&quot; or column, shifting up or down as it gains and loses altitude; forward movement is marked by moving every other card and counter on the board left or right relative to your Zepp.&#10;&#10;A typical scenario has you playing through 30 randomly dealt &quot;Situation Cards,&quot; which represent enemy units, weather conditions, and the odd mountain encountered on the way to and from your primary target. The first 10 cards represent the trip out; the second 10, time over the target area; and the final 10, the trip home, by which point you will likely be damaged and running low on ballast and gas.&#10;&#10;A separate &quot;ballast sheet,&quot; or Zeppelin schematic, is used to keep track of the condition of your craft and crew.

963;The Gardens of the Alhambra;"The Gardens of Alhambra is an abstract influence game from Dirk Henn where each player is represented by plants of a particular color.  Using tiles with all four colors on them, the players place them onto the board in fixed locations.  In doing so, they try to surround victory point markers and capture them.  Of course, since each tile has all of the player's colors represented, every tile placement must be carefully thought-out so that you maximize your points while minimizing them for your opponents.  Ties disqualify players - and so the next highest color total will earn the points.  The player with the most victory points at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;";1993;6.16079;1.7931;2;4;60;8;Abstract Strategy;garden alhambra abstract influence dirk henn represent plant particular color tile color place fix location try surround marker capture course tile color represent tile carefully think maximize minimize opponent tie disqualify high color total earn end winner

Combat is handled by the attacked searcher nominating another searcher to play a combat card, which is compared against Molasar's; the loser is forced to &quot;retreat&quot; by the difference in values. If the searcher wins, they pick up a bonus (non-combat) card. All the searchers have (minor) special powers and Molasar has a number of one-off special cards he can play in trying to delay them.&#10;&#10;You can think of it, almost, as a very early, much simpler version of Lord of the Rings - except that in this one, one of the players gets to be Sauron!&#10;&#10;";1983;5.58541;1.6667;3;6;60;10;Horror, Movies / TV / Radio theme;tie horror film evil demon molasar find hilt weapon destroy hide room near heart labyrinth intriguing element molasar start servant actually eat reduce option term block searcher combat handle attack searcher nominate searcher combat card compare molasar loser force retreat difference value searcher pick bonus non combat card searcher minor special power molasar number special card try delay think early simple lord ring get sauron

The nobles in a player's faction use their military and political powers to gain control of royal heirs in an effort to crown one and put him or her on the throne. Of course everyone is out to capture and control the last heir alive, so once acquired, an heir needs to be protected. &#10; Kingmaker has been published by several companies, starting with Philmar under their Ariel imprint in 1974, by Avalon Hill in 1976, by Gibsons Games in 1983, and by TM Games in 1988/9.

997;Canaletto;"An open auction game, players bid for the heirlooms in Venetian palaces, which then get sold on as groups are completed. A circuit of palaces is seeded with the items, and a marker shows which palace is being auctioned. As players bid, they move a gondola along the circuit, which points which the next auction will be when this one is resolved. Players start with 30 points on the scoring track, and there's a marker to allow debt on the same track. Debt costs double at the game end. There's also a marker to allow you to bribe the auctioneer and take a lot for no cost.&#10;&#10;A series price tiles show the potential value of the next completed lot. So you might get to sell your pictures for 16 each, but you might be forced to sell when the price is only 4 each.&#10;&#10;The game is totally open, and you can do the maths to work out the potential benefits to each player, but the game remains fun and quick. Tying the next auction to the current price is a clever idea too, and it can be worth bidding a bit more to control where the next auction will be.

The exchanged goods must either be brought back for domestic storage (on the storage card) or to trade offices in other harbors, in exchange for other needed products.&#10;&#10;On the storage cards each Hansa merchant finds the products that he must in the course of the game, put in storage. Once a merchant fills his storage card, the game ends and the winner is determined.&#10;&#10;During this time period, wares were transported in sailing ships, cogs or later holks. To reduce the risk of such a dangerous and uncertain journey, merchants formed so-called companies with one or several partners and thereby distributed valuable loads on several ships.&#10;&#10;In this game each player shares a Hansa cog with his left and right-hand neighbors.

Each year there are exactly enough resources to fulfill and the players have to decide which resources to claim for themselves.

1029;Lieber bairisch sterben;"From the translation:&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Better to Die Bavarian&rdquo; is the battle for rule over the Bavarian people in 1705. Three sides fight for power: the Imperial Austrian Army (yellow counters/ Symbol:  Imperial Orb); the Prince&rsquo;s soldiers (blue counters/Symbol: the crown), and the rebellious farmers (red counters/Symbol:  Pitchfork). There are also the monks, who surprisingly intervened in the power struggle.&#10;&#10;Players don't represent a particular faction, but instead must court the factions' leadership each turn.

1035;Squad Leader;"A shot disturbs the eerie silence of a deserted city street, punctuated by the frantic footfalls of men seeking cover. One of Kruger&rsquo;s last veteran NCO&rsquo;s lies motionless in the street. The remnants of the dead man&rsquo;s squad are nowhere to be seen&mdash;scattered in nearby houses and gutters&mdash;all thoughts of the advance abandoned with the sudden demise of their leader...the compulsion for revenge obviously overcome by their instinct for self-preservation. Off to the right, Kruger&rsquo;s own men have located the source of the lethal shot and are laying down a steady stream of fire on the church steeple directly ahead. The absence of responding fire suggests that the lone Russian marksman has beat a hasty retreat or been victimized by the withering fire of the German retort. Kruger has seen enough. He is to occupy the church and set up a regimental observation post at once. His orders leave no leeway for delays by a single sniper. He gives the signal to rush the building. Obedient to their training, his men, veterans of France, the Balkans, and 18 months of fighting in Russia, spring to their feet. Seconds later the sharp, staccato retort of a Russian machinegun concludes with the assertiveness of death itself that this time Kruger was wrong.&#10;&#10;This is Squad Leader, a game of WWII tactical combat in Europe. You make the instant decisions resulting in life or death for your men, victory or defeat for your army. You direct the fire of your squad, select your plan of attack, or set your defenses against massed Russian human wave or armor assaults. Will that hedgerow provide adequate cover for your flanking efforts, or will your men be cut down by the American machinegun position in the woods? The decision is irrevocable and yours alone.&#10;&#10;Squad Leader is more than just a game, it is a game system which can be used to portray any WWII infantry action. Its system does for infantry combat what Panzerblitz and Panzer Leader have done for armored warfare games. Squad Leader provides rules for morale, leadership, machineguns, flamethrowers, demo charges, smoke, hidden placement, sewer movement, off-board artillery, radio contact, anti-tank guns, night actions, wire, entrenchments, mines, bunkers, rubble, multi-story building differentiation, fire, river crossings, roadblocks, mortars, and much more.&#10;&#10;Squad Leader utilizes programmed instruction to guide you through 12 scenarios of increasing realism and complexity. The scenarios run the gamut from street fighting in Stalingrad to armored advances across snow covered roads in the Ardennes. A Campaign Game ties the individual scenarios together and allows your own personal leader counter to advance in rank and ability. In addition, a &ldquo;Design Your Own&rdquo; section is included so that players can create an unlimited number of play situations of their own creation.&#10;&#10;Each hex in Squad Leader represents 40 meters of real terrain with counters representing individual leaders, support weapons, and vehicles or 4 man crews and 12 man squads. Each game turn is divided into two player turns with 8 phases, equivalent to two minutes of actual time.&#10;&#10;Squad Leader is not an easy game. Do not attempt it without prior wargaming experience. Squad Leader is rated Tournament Level IV on the A.H.

1041;San Marco;"Players are attempting to score the most points by building up influence in the districts of Venice via their aristocrats.

1043;Pitstop;"PITSTOP is a motor racing board game. 65 special tiles let the player build virtually any circuit they like. The game comes with multilingual rules (english, spanish, italian, german and french) and instructions to build 10 different F1 circuits.&#10;Each player must set the gear and roll an appropriate number of special dice, that determine the speed of the car and the fuel consuption. The game is turn based and the phasing player, after moving his car, must set the gear for next turn. The box strategy is the most important decision to take. You can decide to complete all the 3 laps without stopping or making one or two pitstops.&#10;The game is not a &quot;simulation&quot;, but to win you need a good amount of skill. Even if the speed of your car is determined by dice, you have to choose carefully the &quot;braking point&quot; in order to enter the curves at the best speed. If you exceed the curve's speed limit, you lose &quot;tyres points&quot;. Of course, you can simulate a championship playing different circuits. What's interesting is that the game strategy changes from circuit to circuit and if you design your own circuit you need all your &quot;driving skill&quot; to be competitive. Rookies can win, but they will find very hard to beat a skilled player.&#10;Game components: 65 tiles to build the circuits (an avarege of 25 tiles are needed for each circuit), 6 plastic sport cars, 12 special dice, 6 &quot;dashboards&quot;, 40 speed limit tokens, 24 plastic pawns, one rules booklet.&#10;&#10;";2001;6.32051;1.5714;2;6;60;10;Racing;pitstop motor racing special tile let build virtually circuit like come multilingual english spanish italian german french instruction build different f circuit set gear appropriate number special dice determine speed car fuel consuption base car set gear box strategy important decision decide complete lap stop make pitstop simulation need good skill speed car determine dice choose carefully brake order enter curve good speed exceed curve speed limit tyre course simulate championship different circuit interesting strategy change circuit circuit circuit need drive skill competitive rookie find hard beat skilled component tile build circuit avarege tile need circuit plastic sport car special dice dashboard speed limit tokens plastic pawn booklet

They place two balls on each figure. They now take turns and choose one of the following three actions.&#10;&#10;1.Move: Players can move the chosen piece as many squares sideways, forwards or backwards as the piece has balls, if it has 4 balls it must move 4 squares. The pieces may neither jump nor change direction.&#10;&#10;2.Sharing: Players may take all the balls from a selected piece and place one each on any of their other pieces. Exception, if a tower has six balls only five balls may be placed on the other five pieces and so one ball is lost and is removed from the game.&#10;&#10;3.Capturing: Only balls are captured, not pieces. The capturing piece and the threatened piece stay on their own squares. Example a white piece and a brown piece stand two squares apart. They have two balls and three balls respectively. It is whites move and white can remove the three brown balls from the game as long as there is no piece between the white and brown pieces. Pieces whose balls have been captured can be activated again by the sharing of balls.&#10;&#10;Therefore, capturing only limits the movement possibilities, the number of pieces always remains the same. If a player loses all their balls they can no longer move and have lost.&#10;&#10;";1986;6.31734;2.4;2;2;20;10;Abstract Strategy;translation place piece opponent row stand piece row place ball figure choose follow action choose piece square sideways forwards backwards piece ball ball square piece jump change direction sharing ball select piece place piece exception tower ball ball place piece ball remove capture ball capture piece capture piece threaten piece stay square example white piece brown piece stand square apart ball ball respectively white white remove brown ball long piece white brown piece piece ball capture activate sharing ball capture limit possibilitie number piece remain ball long
1047;MeM;"from the rules:&#10;&#10;Equipment&#10;A board with 32 indented spaces&#10;32 stones of 11 colours (8+7+3+3+2+2+2+2+1+1+1) Two rules booklets.&#10;&#10;To Start&#10;At the start of the game, the 32 stones are spread randomly over the board surface so that all spaces are filled.  The board is set between the players, leaving a space in front of each player.&#10;&#10;For MEM-Solitaire, you need only one playing space and the filled board.&#10;&#10;The General Idea&#10;You take stones from the MEM board, and use them to build patterns of stones in your playing area.

1063;Schraumen;"Schraumen is a card game based on a nonsense culture, enacting nonsensical laws written on scrolls, paid for with plums.  The name of the game is a portmanteau word from the German Schriftrollen (Scrolls) and Pflaumen (plums).&#10;&#10;The 77 scroll cards are shuffled and the top 11 removed from the game without looking at them.  Deal each player three scrolls and give each player seven plum tokens, which are both money for bidding and victory points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Each scroll is a rule of the game that must be followed when the scroll is played.  If a rule cannot be followed, the scroll is burned in the fire - that is, removed from the game.  Examples include, &quot;Each player must put three plums in the garden,&quot; if at least one player has fewer than three plums.  Or, &quot;The player with the most plums must give all other players a plum,&quot; if two or more players are tied for having the most plums.&#10;&#10;Players take turns reading the scrolls they wish, enacting the new laws, all of which involve plum distribution in some way.  You don't have to enact any of your scrolls unless you have more than five, at which point you MUST activate (or burn, if illegal) enough to bring your hand down to five cards.  A player then draws a scroll, reads it silently, and auctions it off without telling the others what's on it.  He may bid for it himself.&#10;&#10;The game ends when either all scrolls are taken or when the text of a read scroll requires the game to end.  The player with the most plums wins.&#10;&#10;";1992;5.42336;1.1429;3;8;60;13;Card Game;schrauman card base nonsense culture enact nonsensical law write scroll pay plum portmanteau word german schriftrollen scroll pflaumen plum scroll card shuffle remove look deal scroll seven plum token money bidding end scroll follow scroll follow scroll burn fire remove example include plum garden few plum plum plum tie have plum read scroll wish enact new law involve plum distribution way don t enact scroll activate burn illegal bring hand card draw scroll read silently auction tell bid end scroll take text read scroll require end plum

1087;Matschig;"In Matschig, players sling mud at one another by throwing water and sand cards. Well, okay, not literally throwing the cards, but you get the idea.&#10;&#10;To start the game, each player receives a hand of seven cards from the 110-card deck; card types are water, sand, umbrella and special. On a turn, the active player takes one sand and one water card from his hand to create mud, then hurls it at another player. (Again, not literally...) That player has a chance to defend herself by playing umbrella cards to block either the sand or water or both, or by playing special cards that, for example, redirect the mud back to the thrower or spread it out on all other players. Other players can add to someone's attack in order to make the perfect mix of mud &ndash; e.g., adding a 1-value water to a muddy mix of 5-value sand and 4-value water &ndash; and by making the perfect mix, they get to redirect the attack at any player.&#10;&#10;After the mudball hits its target or splats on someone's shield, each player refills her hand to seven cards, then the player who was hit in the previous round starts the new round by choosing a target and throwing. The game continues until the deck runs out of cards, in which case players shuffle discarded cards in order to finish the final round. Players then tally the sand and water points in front of them, and the player with the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.70315;1.0;3;6;30;8;Card Game;matschig sle mud throw water sand card okay literally throw card idea start receive hand seven card card deck card water sand umbrella special active take sand water card hand create mud hurl literally chance defend umbrella card block sand water special card example redirect mud thrower spread add attack order perfect mix mud ndash e g add value water muddy mix value sand value water ndash make perfect mix redirect attack mudball hit target splat shield refill hand seven card hit previous start new choose target throw continue deck run card case shuffle discard card order finish final tally sand water low

But careful, some of those briefcases might explode...&#10;&#10;Aim of the game&#10;Collecting the most points by collecting &quot;explosive cards&quot; with high values.&#10;&#10;Game play&#10;There are four sets of 8 cards, each with values from 1-8. Each player gets a set of one colour.&#10;The explosive cards show briefcases with positive values from 1-8 on one side, and bombs with negative values from 1-8 on the other side. They are shuffled and a number of explosive cards equal to the number of players plus one are laid out, positive side up. The remaining explosive cards are set aside.&#10;&#10;Players try to win as many positive explosive cards as possible. They take turns placing one of their number cards in front of one of the explosive cards.

The explosive card is then turned from its briefcase side to the bomb side, and the player who wins it gets negative points instead.&#10;&#10;A round ends when all players have played all their cards. Card values on each explosive card are added up, with the last card in a row earning its owner an extra two points. The player with the most points in one row wins that explosive card.&#10;&#10;Players get back their number cards and a new round starts with new explosive cards.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all explosive cards are gone or there aren't enough left to start another round.&#10;Players add up the points from all their positive and negative explosive cards.

The first player to collect a series gets the 18-point victory card, the next series is worth 17 points and so on, so the sooner you complete series, the better.&#10;&#10;On his/her turn, a player has the following choices:&#10;&#10;     They can take the top card from the draw deck and use it in their own card display.&#10;     They can give the top card from the draw deck to one of the other players and get a single (i.e. not part of a series) card from that player's display. Before they can add it to their own display, they have to turn the card over, so its value can be up to two points lower or higher than what they originally saw.&#10;     They can take the top card from a completed series for which another player has already scored points. That card has to be turned over and used with its other side up too.&#10;&#10;&#10;If a player manages to incorporate a card into his/her card display, they get another turn (limit: 3 consecutive turns). There is no limit on how many rows a player can start in his/her display.&#10;&#10;The game ends when there are no cards left in the draw deck.&#10;The player with the most victory points wins the game.&#10;&#10;";2000;5.21236;1.6;2;4;30;10;Card Game, Memory;card coin possibly roman abstract card memory element try collect possible collect series consecutively number card coin card value print side value differ maximum collect series coin consecutive value e g series exchange card card value collect series get card series worth soon complete series well follow card draw deck use card display card draw deck single e series card display add display card value low high originally see card complete series card manage incorporate card card display limit consecutive limit row start display end card leave draw deck

1115;Poker;"Poker is played with a standard deck of 52-cards, and sometimes Jokers are added as wild cards. The object of the game is to win the pot which contains all the bets the players have made in a deal.  Players are dealt cards which are usually reduced to a Poker hand of five (5) cards. Betting and bluffing are used in rounds until all bets are squared up, or until all other players have conceded the pot (folded). If all bets have been squared up, the rounds are followed by a &quot;showdown&quot; in which all hands are fully revealed; the one with the best combination of a Poker hand of five (5) cards being the winner.&#10;&#10;The following table describes and ranks the standard Poker hands:&#10;&#10;Five of a Kind (Only if wild cards are in use):  Four cards of the same rank and one wild card (eg: A, A, A, A, Joker).&#10;Straight Flush: A straight with all cards of the same suit (eg: A, K, Q, J, 10: all spades). (The highest Straight Flush is nominally called a Royal Flush)&#10;Four of a Kind:  Four cards of the same rank (eg: A, A, A, A, K).&#10;Full House:  Three of a kind in one rank and a pair in a different rank (eg: A, A, A, K, K). &#10;Flush:  Five cards of the same suit (eg: A, K, Q, J, 9: all spades)&#10;Straight:  Five cards in sequence of rank (eg: A, K, Q, J, 10).&#10;Three of a Kind:  Three cards of the same rank (eg: A, A, A, K, Q).&#10;Two Pair:  Two pairs of different ranks (eg: A, A, K, K, Q).&#10;One Pair:  A pair of cards of the same rank (eg: A, A, K, Q, J).&#10;High Card:  High card without any other higher combination (eg: A, K, Q, J, 9).&#10;&#10;";1810;6.71106;2.4309;2;10;60;12;Bluffing, Card Game;poker standard deck card joker add wild card object pot contain bet deal deal card usually reduce poker hand card bet bluffing bet square concede pot fold bet square follow showdown hand fully reveal good combination poker hand card winner follow table describe rank standard poker hand kind wild card use card rank wild card eg joker straight flush straight card suit eg k q j spade high straight flush nominally call royal flush kind card rank eg k house kind rank pair different rank eg k k flush card suit eg k q j spade straight card sequence rank eg k q j kind card rank eg k q pair pair different rank eg k k q pair pair card rank eg k q j high card high card high combination eg k q j
1117;You're Bluffing!;"Classic bidding and bluffing game. The deck consists of sets of farm animals, 4 cards per animal. Players auction off the top animal of the deck, or try to complete their set by trading with another player. Highest bid wins, but auctioneer always has the choice to buy the animal for the same price as the highest bid.&#10;Trading is a blind bidding system: both players place their bid face down on the table and reveal them simultaneously to each other. High bidder gets the other player's animal. Both players swap their bid. It's best to bid just a little bit more than your opponent, but just how much did he bid?&#10;&#10;reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;Kuhhandel Master (2009)&#10;&#10;";1985;6.58203;1.6261;3;5;45;10;Animals, Bluffing, Card Game, Humor;classic bidding bluff deck consist set farm animal card animal auction animal deck try complete set trade high bid auctioneer buy animal price high bid trading blind bidding place bid face table reveal simultaneously high bidder get animal swap bid good bid little bit opponent bid reimplemente kuhhandel master
1125;Big Shot;"Big Shot is an auction game in which a set of colored cubes is put up for auction each round based on a random die roll. Whoever wins the bid, places those cubes in areas on the game board. Once an area has seven cubes in it, that area is locked and no more cubes can be added. Whoever has the majority of cubes in that area owns it &mdash; except that ties for majority are disregarded, so in a spread of 3/3/1 cubes, the player with only one cube owns that area!&#10;&#10;Players have a limited amount of money with which to bid. They can take one loan each turn, but the first loan gives them only $9 more, while the second loan gives them $8 and the third $7. At the end of the game, the player must repay $10 for each loan taken, with that money coming from the value of the property they now own.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players tally the value of what they own (with some properties being doubled in value if the player owns that region's doubler as well as areas within that region), then repay all loans.

1127;Encounters;"Encounters is a light, &quot;take that&quot; sort of card game with a  D&amp;D / fantasy theme.  The game features a deck of cards consisting of heroes, monsters, weapons and treasure.  Each player starts the game with a party of adventurers (hero cards) on their side (think clerics, fighters, elves, etc.).  During your turn you draw two cards and play two cards, allowing you to perform actions like sending monsters to fight other players, equipping your heroes with weapons, or placing acquired treasure in your personal vault.  A simple combat system is used to resolve monster attacks (which can kill your heroes), and then play passes to the next player.&#10;&#10;Adding some complexity and theme are a number of special ability rules that apply to the different heroes and monsters, such as spells, turning undead,  armor abilities, fiery breath, etc.  When only one player has heroes left standing, that player gets a gold bonus and the round ends.  The cards are collected and a new round begins!  Rinse and repeat until the winning player reaches a certain level of accumulated wealth.&#10;&#10;Re-issued as a CCG with more cards in 1995 under the name Fantasy Adventures.&#10;&#10;";1982;5.892;1.6667;2;4;60;10;Adventure, Card Game, Fantasy, Fighting, Medieval;encounter light sort card d amp d fantasy deck card consist hero monster weapon treasure start party adventurer hero card think cleric fighter elve etc draw card card allow perform action like send monster fight equip hero weapon place acquire treasure personal vault simple combat resolve monster attack kill hero pass add complexity number special apply different hero monster spell undead armor fiery breath etc hero leave stand get gold bonus end card collect new begin rinse repeat reach certain accumulate wealth issue ccg card fantasy adventure
1129;Archimedes;"This is a strategy game for 2-3 players. It takes place on a 6 sided game board with pieces moving on the triangles. Each player has 4 pawns in the form of dice. The triangular fields of the board are molded so that a corner of a die exactly fits in. The die can be moved from space to space with a simple nudge at the top.&#10;&#10;Object of the game is to get your 4 dice across the board.&#10;&#10;PREPARATION FOR THE GAME WITH TWO ? The younger player chooses a color and puts his 4 dice into four edge spaces of his side of the board.&#10;&#10;WHAT DOES A TURN CONSIST OF?&#10;&#10;1.) Each turn must be executed completely. One might not skip a part of the turn. You may not move a die less than its actual movement unless you reach the finish without completing your die roll  &#10;2.)   Dice may not touch. So a die will block 3 spaces. (2 spaces if on an edge.)&#10;3.)   If a player has no legal move, he skips his turn.&#10;&#10;GAME RULES FOR THREE PLAYERS All rules of the normal game for two persons are valid also for the game with three. &#10;Additionally you must follow these rules: 1.)

1133;Organized Crime;"The object of the game is to be the ONLY surviving player.  A player is removed from the game when his Boss is rubbed-out.  Much of the game involves moving Hit-Men about a circular board in an attempt to build up your influence via corrupt politicians, illegal activities and business investments.  Occasionally, Hit-Men can be penalized for making mistakes (cards are drawn and effects are carried out), sometimes attempts at rubbing out mob bosses may occur.  There are also opportunities for negotiation &aacute; la:  &quot;If you help me with a vote of support, I will pay for the next business venture you land on.&quot;  Cards, money and promises are all possible bargaining chips.

1135;Quest For Power;"Quest for Power is billed as a &quot;Game Masterless Role-Playing System&quot;. In actuality, it is a fantasy-themed board game where the board is constructed each play session from randomly dealt cards. It has all the trappings of a role-playing game: character generation, multiple races and professions, skills, spells, weapons, etc. But the actual game play is very much a board game: move along the board, turn over unexplored cards, and deal with the situation given on them. Players can compete against one another, or work cooperatively. Like any good multiplayer game, there are alliances and treacherous betrayals among the players. In the end, in order to defeat the evil lord in his castle (the main objective of the game) at least some of the players will need to team up because the castle lord is more powerful than any one character can handle.&#10;&#10;Evidently the publisher had visions of making a whole series of games based on the R.A.G.G.S. (Random Adventure Game Generating System). The sub-title for the game is &quot;Darkness in the Light&quot; and it is called a &quot;Starter Set for Character Levels 1 - 3&quot;, presumably because other scenarios and rules for higher level characters were planned. As far as I know, no expansions for the game were ever produced and Infinite Imagination, Inc. is no more.&#10;&#10;";1997;3.125;2.0;1;8;90;12;Adventure, Card Game, Exploration, Fantasy, Fighting;quest power bill masterless role actuality fantasy construct session randomly deal card trapping role playing character generation multiple race profession skill spell weapon etc actual unexplored card deal situation give compete work cooperatively like good alliance treacherous betrayal end order defeat evil lord castle main need team castle lord powerful character handle evidently publisher vision make series base r g g random adventure generating sub title darkness light call starter set character presumably high character plan far know produce infinite imagination inc

Whoever can land at his destination first wins. Fantastische Ballonreise will take you flying all over Germany and its neighbors following a &quot;must visit&quot; list set at the start of the game. At the various stops you will read a card which is descriptive of the folklore of the location and has a special effect on play, including trivia contests, drawing pictures or singing songs. This game was developed as a promotional item for the soft drink manufacturer Fanta. Includes five miniature plastic balloons which go up and down on stands to show their current altitude. Players race their balloons, and special dice are used to determine the change of orientation of a large wind rose, which indicates the amount of movement permitted in each direction, but lines on the board indicate which directions can be travelled in from each space. Cards are dealt out to indicate start position, end position and four intermediate points in each player's route.

1143;Warrior Knights;"Players vie against each other to take over as many cities on the map as they can.  The player who controls more than half of the un-razed cities of the kingdom wins.  Warrior Knights is a game where players use armies to conquer cities and rout opposing forces.  Cities provide income which pays for armies and city improvements.  The interesting aspect of the game, though, is the Assembly where players vote on various motions drawn from the deck of Assembly cards.  These motions are mainly for titles and appointments such as governors, ambassadors and other offices which give the holder additional troops, or for concessions which create additional income for the holder.  As in any game of this nature, alliances are forged and broken between players in order to further goals until one player emerges victorious.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Warrior Knights&#10;&#10;&#10;";1985;6.62575;3.2203;2;6;180;10;Fantasy, Fighting, Medieval, Negotiation, Political, Territory Building;vie city map half un raze city kingdom warrior knight use army conquer city rout oppose force city provide income pay army city improvement interesting aspect assembly vote motion draw deck assembly card motion mainly title appointment governor ambassador office holder additional troop concession create additional income holder nature alliance forge break order emerge victorious implement warrior knight

1155;Capitol;"&quot;Architects of the Eternal City&quot;.&#10;&#10;Rivalry in old Rome for the most spectacular buildings and dominance in the Roman prefectures. Whoever uses the 90 blocks and 40 roofs best will win. There are four rounds to a game: Each round has a building phase, an auction phase, a scoring phase and a card drawing phase. In the building phase, players decide on the height of the buildings and build them at the side of the board; if they have the necessary permit, they can build on the board itself. A building is finished when it has a roof; the first roof in a prefecture determines the shape of all other roofs. In the auction phase players can auction for temples, wells and amphitheaters, earning extra points. This is a beautiful production.&#10;&#10;This game by Alan R.

Each player sits on one side of the board. The red, green, yellow or blue strip at the board&rsquo;s edge determines the color each player uses.&#10;&#10;A player is chosen to be banker. He distributes to each player 1 million dollars (5 x $10,000; 3 x $50,000; 3 x $100,000; 2 x $250,000). He puts the remaining money beside the board and administers it separately from his own money.&#10;&#10;The 25 movie cards are mixed thoroughly and a card is put face down on each board space.&#10;&#10;The 25 miniature screens and the 6 Golden Suns are put beside the board.&#10;&#10;Everyone throws the numbered die once. The player with the highest result (the star equals 6) begins. The game proceeds after him clockwise.&#10;&#10;Play, phase 1 &#10;On his turn, a player throws both dice. The intersection of the column (number-die) and row (letter-die) determines a board space. If the movie card on this space is face down, the player can and should buy this space with this card. He pays $10,000 to the bank and turns the card face up. Now, a miniature screen is put on this space. The player takes a screen from the reserve and puts it on the space so that his color appears through the two gaps in the framework of the screen.&#10;&#10;Finally, the acquired movie card is put into the screen, face up.&#10;&#10;Play, phase 2&#10;As soon as all 25 movie cards are owned and face up in miniature screens on the board, the second game phase begins. Now movie cards can change hands.&#10;&#10;Debts and bankruptcy&#10;If a player must pay a sum and no longer has sufficient cash, he must sell his movie cards and/or Golden Suns. The player chooses what he would like to sell. The bank pays the sums printed on the cards, and Golden Suns fetch the same amount. Sold movie cards are turned face down again, and the screens and Golden Suns go back to the reserve. How-ever, the bank only takes back cards and Golden Suns if a player is insolvent.&#10;&#10;A player who cannot settle his debts must declare bankruptcy. He gives all his remaining cash, miniature screens and Golden Suns back to the bank. The movie cards are turned face down again. The player retires from the game. If movie cards are turned face down in the second game phase, the game returns to the first game phase. Therefore, takeovers of movie cards that belong to other players cannot take place.&#10;&#10;Negotiations &#10;All players are allowed to negotiate with other players anytime, even if it is not their turn. Movie cards may be bought, sold or traded. Players can also negotiate in order to pay debts. They need not necessarily sell to the bank if they receive better purchase offers from players.  Players can also negotiate whether owed sums on opponents&rsquo; movie cards can be reduced or even free of charge.&#10;&#10;Ending the game&#10;The game is over when only one player remains.

1179;Tendix;"PROCESS OF GAME&#10;The player whose turn it is draws one tile from the bag and places it on any free space.&#10;The colour on top is decisive for the effect of the tile. All tiles in the distance that corresponds to the colour (straight line) are turned upside down. Diagonal distances do not count here. Violet (zero) up means of course that nothing is turned. Only a just placed tile can have an effect, there are no chain reactions.&#10;Example: If I lay down a tile with orange up, all tiles that are exactly two spaces away from that tile are turned around, but not those who are one or more than two spaces away. The games lasts until all tiles are placed and the board is completed.&#10;&#10;from the rules translation&#10;OBJECT OF THE GAME&#10;At the end of the game every player counts separately the number of tiles showing his two colours on the top. Now he subtracts the lower number from the higher one. That is his final result.&#10;Example: With red and green as my colors, eight red tiles are tying up and three green ones. Thus I have five points.&#10;If the final result, of two players is the same, the player with more tiles up (sum of the two colours) wins the game.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.5625;2.0;2;3;45;0;;process draw tile bag place free space colour decisive effect tile tile distance correspond colour straight line upside diagonal distance count violet zero mean course place tile effect chain reaction example lay tile orange tile exactly space away tile space away last tile place complete translation object end count separately number tile show colour subtract low number high final result example red green color red tile tie green one final result tile sum colour

1191;Card Caper;"Each player is dealt a Hidden Card to begin.  The object is to accumulate points by deducing the opponents' Hidden Card as quickly as possible.  Next, each player is dealt an equal portion of the remaining deck, and must give information to the opponents; s/he must lay down a card of Higher Value, Lower Value, Different Value, and Different Suit.  Players are given notepads in the style of Clue to make notes about what cards are played, and what can't be the Hidden Card of each player. Then, each player takes it in turn to roll the die, and either reveal more information, or guess at the identity of an opponents' card.  Wrong guesses give no penalty, so you may as well try.  If you're right, you get one point for each card remaining in that player's hand.  This creates reverse suspense: players race to be first, because cards are dropped each round, and five points for last with a Hidden Card unguessed isn't enough to overcome someone who nailed two Hidden Cards early on.  After everyone has revealed their card, whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;";1997;4.88646;1.0;2;4;30;8;Card Game, Deduction, Memory;deal hidden card begin object accumulate deduce opponent hide card quickly possible deal equal portion remain deck information opponent lay card high value low value different value different suit give notepad style clue note card t hidden card take die reveal information guess identity opponent card wrong guess penalty try right card remain hand create reverse suspense race card drop hidden card unguesse isn t overcome nail hide card early reveal card
1193;The Bottom Line;"The idea of The Bottom Line is to accumulate $5,000,000 and land on the Bank, so as to buy it.  Not as easy as it sounds.  You have $1,000,000 cash, $2,000,000 in debt and 2000 oz. of gold to begin. There are several different businesses, and you can buy parts of them for anywhere from $100,000 each for Residentials, to $600,000 for Casinos.  When someone lands on a property you own, you get $50,000 per property of the same kind you own.  But the big money comes when you collect a full set of property.  Land on a Drive-in Realtor and you can collect multiple millions for selling your set.  There are also Options, which allow you to buy lots from your opponents at nauseatingly low prices, and gold is bought for $600,000 a brick (or in that area) and sells for over $1 million.  Gold seems to be the fast way to money, but you must have the appropriate card, or you'll get fined $100,000.  As players get out of debt (or deeper in it), they will find themselves in a die-rolling race to land on the Bank, or square 17, which allows you to go anywhere you want.

When a case comes to court, players add their Evidence cards, and make Motions and Objections, in order to sway the jury to their side. Then the case is either settled by plea bargain (an agreement by lawers to divide the case money) or by the jury (a 2D6 dice roll of 13 or more which includes all card modifiers played on this case).

1207;Big Deal;"Big Deal is a game of corporate business deals. Players are big investors (and I mean big - the smallest notes are $50 million and billions of dollars change hands) and wheeler-dealers.&#10;&#10;Players acquire shares in companies, primarily randomly (picked up as cards), but also possibly through purchase of other players' previous sales. To form the companies they must also acquire resources, which are bought from 4 sets. The pricing mechanism for these is like Palmyra and McMulti - each purchase increases the price and each sale decreases it. Once an appropriate set is acquired for a matching set of (at least two) shares in a company, the company can be formed. Companies pay income to their owners each turn. They can also be sold off at a premium, or split up (provided the owner has enough shares and resources) to gain double income. The real heart of the game comes in the option to conduct hostile takeovers. A player lays one or more shares in a company owned by another player and then starts a bidding war to takeover the company. Each player is bidding to buy the shares of the opponent (bids are per share). The &quot;winner&quot; gets the company and all the shares, the &quot;loser&quot; is paid off at the final bid price. Who is actually the winner and loser depends, of course, on the balance of the final price.&#10;&#10;There is a sudden death variable finish, when assets plummet in value, so there is a tense few final rounds when players can try to realize assets while they are still valuable. During this period the judgment of takeover prices becomes even more tricky (and a gamble).&#10;&#10;";2001;5.55558;3.0;2;6;120;12;Economic;big deal corporate business deal big investor mean big small note million billion dollar change hand wheeler dealer acquire share company primarily randomly pick card possibly purchase previous sale form company acquire resource buy set pricing mechanism like palmyra mcmulti purchase increase price sale decrease appropriate set acquire matching set share company company form company pay income owner sell premium split provide owner share resource gain double income real heart come option conduct hostile takeover lay share company own start bidding war takeover company bid buy share opponent bid share winner get company share loser pay final bid price actually winner loser depend course balance final price sudden death variable finish asset plummet value tense final try realize asset valuable period judgment takeover price tricky gamble

1219;Labyrinth;"Labyrinth (formerly The aMAZEing Labyrinth) has spawned a whole line of Labyrinth games. The game board has a set of tiles fixed solidly onto it; the remaining tiles that make up the labyrinth slide in and out of the rows created by the tiles that are locked in place. One tile always remains outside the labyrinth, and players take turns taking this extra tile and sliding it into a row of the labyrinth, moving all those tiles and pushing one out the other side of the board; this newly removed tile becomes the piece for the next player to add to the maze.&#10;&#10;Players move around the shifting paths of the labyrinth in a race to collect various treasures. Whoever collects all of his treasures first and returns to his home space wins!&#10;&#10;Labyrinth is simple at first glance and an excellent puzzle-solving game for children; it can also be played by adults using more strategy and more of a cutthroat approach.&#10;&#10;";1986;6.40937;1.3401;2;4;20;8;Children's Game, Maze, Puzzle;labyrinth amaze labyrinth spawn line labyrinth set tile fix solidly remain tile labyrinth slide row create tile lock place tile remain outside labyrinth take extra tile slide row labyrinth tile push newly remove tile piece add maze shift path labyrinth race collect treasure collect treasure return home space labyrinth simple glance excellent puzzle solve child adult strategy cutthroat approach

The heftier the meal, the more you advance.  Some of the meal cards have a ghost on their back; if you win one of those, you move back instead of forward.  You also have a silver platter; you can use that to send the ghost to another cat --but he'll then have the silver platter for later, and you won't...&#10;&#10;One final note: when multiple players bet on the same meal, their betting tokens remain on the card for the next betting round --this mechanic forces the implicated players to choose something else, and can signal an opportunity for the lone player to be in a position to bet on that meal...&#10;&#10;Simple and fast playing.&#10;&#10;";1993;5.32857;2.0;3;6;20;10;Children's Game;age simultaneously bet meal card bet correctly e bet particular meal table close soft cushion hefty meal advance meal card ghost instead forward silver platter use send ghost cat ll silver platter later t final note multiple bet meal bet token remain card bet force implicate choose signal opportunity lone position bet meal simple fast playing
1225;Quest;"&quot;A family game of knights in search of the magical ring, set in the age of myths.&quot;&#10;&#10;Each of the four states of Tirad, Urgad, Galad and Elgad has one large city.  Life in a city flourishes for the inhabitants only when the magical ring is there.  Unfortunately, the ring never stays long in one place.  A band of brave knights is gathered together in Galad where they hear rumours that the ring has been seen in Tirad.  The Quest begins...&#10;&#10;Each player tries to find the ring and transport it to the cities.  As a reward, they receive the seals of these cities.  Collect three different seals to win.  Many obstacles are to be overcome and dragons slain before a knight's quest is complete.&#10;&#10;This is a fairly abstract game.  Each player has three extra &quot;lives&quot; and loses one when defeated by a dragon or when attacking another player.  These lives are replenished by visiting cities.  The ring allows its bearer some significant advantages such as passing through obstacles.  Special spots on the map allow new obstacles to be placed or existing ones to be moved, so a player can be affected even by other players far from him.  The end game can drag a bit as all the other players coordinate their efforts against the leader.&#10;&#10;";1984;5.13993;1.7857;3;6;50;12;Adventure, Fantasy, Medieval;family knight search magical ring set age myth state tirad urgad galad elgad large city life city flourish inhabitant magical ring unfortunately ring stay long place band brave knight gather galad hear rumour ring see tirad quest begin try find ring transport city reward receive seal city collect different seal obstacle overcome dragon slay knight quest complete fairly abstract extra live defeat dragon attack life replenish visit city ring allow bearer significant advantage pass obstacle special spot map allow new obstacle place exist one affect far end drag bit coordinate effort leader
1227;Stonewall;"Designer/Publisher's Description:&#10;&#10;The object of Stonewall is to race your opponents from your starting point to your diagonally opposite corner of a 144 square grid board and back again by the roll of the dice.  Every time you move you may place one wall piece of any length (single,double or triple)on the playing board to help your path or hinder your opponent.  Rolling a four will get you an extra turn and landing on an occupied square will send your opponent back to the start.  Once you have made it to your opposite corner on the turn you pass around it you must change one wall that has already been placed, this can be done to speed up your path home or to force an opponent to go backwards if they are winning.&#10;Stonewall has great strategy play patterns but the dice play throws the element of luck into it.  As a two player game Stonewall is very competitive yet as a four player game it is very social.  New Zealand Consumer Magazine has rated us as the top game in there December 2000 issue after having the game independently play tested,and we are now starting to sell thousands throughout New Zealand.&#10;&#10;";1996;6.12821;1.5;2;4;45;8;Abstract Strategy, Maze;designer publisher description object stonewall race opponent starting diagonally opposite corner square grid dice time place wall piece length single double triple playing help path hinder opponent extra land occupy square send opponent start opposite corner pass change wall place speed path home force opponent backwards stonewall great strategy pattern dice throw element luck stonewall competitive social new zealand consumer magazine rate december issue have independently test start sell thousand new zealand
1231;Bandu;"Players take turns choosing blocks and giving them to each other to place on their structure.  A player may pay a certain number of 'beans' to refuse a block and it gets passed to the next player.  When a player's structure falls, they are out of the game.  Last player standing wins.&#10;&#10;Description of Bandu (1992, Milton Bradley, 2-6 players):&#10;Bandu is based upon the game of Bausack. Each player is given a base block and a number of beans. During a turn, a player chooses a wood block from a common supply and either holds a Refuse or Use auction. All player bid with their beans and the winner/loser must place the piece on their tower. If your tower falls you are out of the game. The last tower standing wins.&#10;&#10;Description of Sac Noir (Rio Grande Games, 2-8 players):&#10;There are five variations on how to play. The goal in all of them is to build a tower. The bag contains very different wooden pieces (i.e. an ashlar, an egg, a ring, a fir tree etc.) as well as a sack of beans for the &quot;auction variation&quot; of the game. Depending on the variation you choose, either each player builds his own tower or all build one together. The &quot;auction variations&quot; are the most suspenseful and surprising. One might end up spending quite some beans to avoid building an especially difficult element. Gambling and bluffing abilities are needed just as much as a feeling for statics and construction skills. It's a game with almost endless building possibilities. It's a challenge for steady hands and shaky suspense for clever tacticians.&#10;&#10;";1987;6.7968;1.2862;2;8;45;7;Action / Dexterity, Party Game;choose block give place structure pay certain number bean refuse block get pass structure fall standing description bandu milton bradley bandu base bausack give base block number bean choose wood block common supply hold refuse use auction bid bean winner loser place piece tower tower fall tower standing description sac noir rio grande variation build tower bag contain different wooden piece e ashlar egg ring fir tree etc sack bean auction variation depend variation choose build tower build auction variation suspenseful surprising end spend bean avoid build especially difficult element gambling bluff need feeling static construction skill endless building possibility challenge steady hand shaky suspense clever tactician

A category is selected for each class and the players and five letter tiles are drawn. The players have 5 minutes to come up with an example that begins with each letter for each class/category. There are also variations on the game to make it harder (like using the same letter for all five words) or to allow children to play against adults competitively with easier questions.&#10;&#10;2007 update: Now part of University Game's Bookcase Series.  The game has been updated to remove many of the esoteric categories (foreign words, spelling, authors of ______ descent).  It's now much more a test of pop culture trivial knowledge and there is no longer the option to select a category only.  One must now pick a Category and Topic (the term 'class' was removed).

1235;Yellowstone;"The eternal turning of the seasons has come full cycle once again. Spring in the hight country enters with a wash of fresh green and the warming chinook, while the show still lies deep on the mountain peaks. As the snow recedes, wild flowers of every hue splash across the lush meadows of the Northern Rockies. The small life in burrow and den creep forth, the birds sing loudly in the pines. Spring is the true beginning of the new year in the awakening wilderness of the Yellowstone.&#10;&#10;The old buck raises his head and turns his gaze to the horizon. The time has come - now to lead the herd to the summer pasture where the bounty of this land will drive away the hunger of winter past. But other animals have come forth from their dens with the spring - the coyote, grizzly bear, mountain lion, and the deadliest predator of all - Man. The natural dangers of this magnificent, rugged land loom ahead. Yet the herd, to prosper, must take to the well-worn trail, seeking to cross the migratory paths of the other grazing masses. As the young gambol and explore, every instinct of the old buck must be devoted to the trek. Without hesitation, he takes the first step toward the future.&#10;&#10;Yellowstone is a less complex game dealing with moving your herd from Winter Pasturage to Summer Pasturage back to Winter Pasturage.  Players control one of the following herds: bison, elk, sheep, or mule deer.  Along the way, you try to pick up Food Points and avoid predators.  You can move the animals in your herd a certain number of hexes in a turn; males are the fastest, females are a bit slower, babies are really slow and should be accompanied by females.  However, when you finally get back to Winter Range, you score more for babies and females than you do for males -- so you may find it necessary to sacrifice a male or two to predators.  Predators are controlled by your opponents, but you get to control them on your turn.  They are not major threats, but inducement to keep moving.  Collect those food points!  You'll need them for winter.&#10;The game's map centers on the Yellowstone Park area and some of the land south of there.&#10;&#10;";1985;5.74021;1.7812;2;4;120;8;Animals, Farming, Racing;eternal turning season come cycle spring hight country enter wash fresh green warm chinook lie deep mountain peak snow recede wild flower hue splash lush meadow northern rockie small life burrow den creep forth bird sing loudly pine spring true beginning new year awakening wilderness yellowstone old buck raise head gaze horizon time come lead herd summer pasture bounty land drive away hunger winter past animal come forth den spring coyote grizzly bear mountain lion deadly predator man natural danger magnificent rugged land loom ahead herd prosper wear trail seek cross migratory path graze masse young gambol explore instinct old buck devoted trek hesitation take step future yellowstone complex deal herd winter pasturage summer pasturage winter pasturage follow herds bison elk sheep mule deer way try pick food avoid predator animal herd certain number hex male fast female bit slow baby slow accompany female finally winter range baby female male find necessary sacrifice male predator predator opponent major threat inducement collect food ll need winter map center yellowstone park area land south

1253;Limits;"A color based card game where players try to track the number of cards played in each color vs.  a limit card with maximums for each color.  Successful challenges result in points for the winner and penalties for the loser.&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;Deal each player 5 cards (show one of 5 colors), then reveal the top Limit Card. Limit Cards specify limits (0 - unlimited) for the number of allowable cards in each of the 5 colors. Players place one of their cards face down in front of them -- these will modify the limits, adding one per card played this round. In turn order, players either challenge a previous player's play, or play card(s).&#10;&#10;Challenging: may &quot;call&quot; any player's last played card. Figure out which card they played last, and count how many of those cards have been discarded. Reveal all face-down cards and add those matching that color to the limit on the Limit Card. If the total exceeds the Limit, you get +1 VP and the challenged gets -2 VP; otherwise, vice versa.&#10;&#10;After resolving a Challenge, flip discard pile face down and place under draw deck WITHOUT shuffling. Players return their Limit-modifying card to hand; reveal a new Limit card and play again (player who got the -2 VP plays first).&#10;&#10;Playing Card(s): place a card to the discard pile, then draw a card.

Players may win by capturing four castles, capturing three castles and toppling the King, or capturing two castles and winning three tournaments.&#10;&#10;Each card displays a dice combination that must be beaten to win the card. Dice are rolled several times with the player saving good dice, throwing out sixes, and rerolling others for a better score. Special cards add a lot of flavor to the dice battles.

1265;Mystery Rummy: Jekyll & Hyde;"It's still rummy at heart, with multiple suits of 5 cards each, with the twist being that the suits are designated J for Jekyll, H for Hyde, or J/H for suits that count as both Jekyll and Hyde. The unique mechanism in this version of MR is that there is a two sided card (the 'identity card') on the table next to the draw deck, which has Jekyll on one side, and Hyde on the other. At the start of the game, Dr. Jekyll is showing, but this can change if a &quot;potion&quot; card is played (one of the three gavel cards, cards you can only play one of on your turn). You then flip the identity card over, and draw 2 cards from the draw deck. This is important, because you can only play melds whose suit matches the identity that is currently showing.&#10;&#10;The identity card is important in scoring as well, because any melds that match the identity card when scoring count double, and during scoring if all your meld suits match the current identity card, you shut the other player out!

1267;Polar Dare!;"Race your penguins across ice floes, while avoiding the hungry polar bear. The gameboard is a 4x4 array of movable ice floes; more exactly, each one is either on the right or left of its square, and this is critical for adjacency. You split your movement points between your penguins and moving the ice floes (which is good when you can shift several carried penguins), but sometimes the die has you move the polar bear instead. He chases after penguins, sending them back to the starting area.&#10;&#10;The game has some similarities to the German game Im Reich des wei&#195;&#159;en B&#195;&#164;ren that was designed by Charles Lerue and published by Schmidt Spiele in the same year (1991).&#10;&#10;";1991;5.53254;1.2105;2;4;30;6;Animals, Children's Game, Racing;race penguin ice floe avoid hungry polar bear gameboard x array movable ice floe exactly right left square critical adjacency split penguin ice floe good shift carry penguin die polar bear instead chase penguin send starting area similarity german m reich des wei en b ren charles lerue publish schmidt spiele year
1269;Skip-Bo;"Each player is dealt a stockpile of 30 cards. The winner will be whoever manages to empty their stockpile first. Cards are played onto four shared building piles in numerical sequence from 1 to 12. On each turn, a player draws until they have five cards in their hand, and then plays cards from: their hand, a top card of their discard piles, or their stockpile. At the end of their turn, a player must discard onto one of their four personal discard piles. Strategy involves the organizing of cards into the discard piles, care in not setting up the next players for good plays, knowing when to play from which option, and especially the timing of playing a valuable &quot;Skip-bo&quot; wildcard.&#10;&#10;Skip-bo is based on Traditional Card Games: Spite and Malice.&#10;&#10;";1967;5.61895;1.1979;2;6;20;8;Card Game;deal stockpile card winner manage stockpile card share building pile numerical sequence draw card hand card hand card discard pile stockpile end discard personal discard pile strategy involve organizing card discard pile care set good know option especially timing valuable skip bo wildcard skip bo base traditional card spite malice

1275;221B Baker Street: The Master Detective Game;"221B Baker Street is the London address of the world's most celebrated fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes, and his dedicated companion, Dr. Watson. In this game you start at 221B and travel through the streets and alleys of London picking up clues and attempting to solve the most intriguing cases Holmes and Watson have ever faced.&#10;&#10;Each player assumes the role of Holmes and matches wits with the other players to determine who possesses the most skillful powers of deduction.  Each case is represented by a card that features a crime told in story form, a selection of probable suspects and a list of locations involved in that crime. Clues are hidden throughout London, one in each of fourteen locations. Players must collect clues from each location, noting them down on their checklists as they attempt to find the answers to the questions listed on the case card.&#10;&#10;Naturally, the crime scene will often contain vital clues, and a prudent detective always checks with the neighbors. Still, you can learn something vital almost anywhere in town.  The first player to figure out the correct answers to a particular mystery or crime, return to 221B and announce the solution, is the winner.&#10;&#10;The original 221B Baker Street Board game was created and copyrighted by American writer Jay Moriarty (dba Antler Productions) in 1975.

1289;All The King's Men;"This is a strategy game similar to chess.  The board is layed out like a chess board and each player sets up their men just like in chess.  Unlike chess, the board for Smess has various types of arrows printed on each square of the &quot;chess&quot; board.  Movement is determined by the direction of the arrow or arrows in the square.  The pieces are similar to chess in that the Brain is like a king in chess, Ninnies are like pawns, and Numskulls are like rooks or bishops.  This is a fun game that is much simpler than chess at first glance. However, the game will vary in difficulty depending on the skill of the opponent.  The goal is to capture your opponent's Brain.  The fact that both players can &quot;see&quot; all possible moves to and from a square can make the game harder than you'd think!

Capturing takes place when exactly two pieces are sandwiched between pieces of the opposite color. There are multiple variations of the game for greater challenge and complexity.  The 20th anniversary edition is a deluxe version of the game with a large color game instruction book, quality game board, and six sets of different colored glass markers that allows play with up to 6 players.&#10;&#10;Other five-in-a-row games include Go-Moku and Renju (which do not feature capturing), and Ninuki-Renju (which does).&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;&#10;    5ive Straight&#10;    Take 5&#10;    5 in a Row&#10;    Go-Moku&#10;    Renju&#10;&#10;&#10;";1977;6.65772;2.0803;2;4;30;8;Abstract Strategy;pente abstract strategy place glass marker intersection grid object marker row capture pair opponent piece capturing take place exactly piece sandwich piece opposite color multiple variation great challenge complexity th anniversary deluxe large color instruction book quality set different colored glass marker allow row include moku renju capturing ninuki renju similar ve straight row moku renju

Six spaces along the track are &quot;pie spaces&quot;, and from these there are &quot;spokes&quot; of track leading to the middle of the board.&#10;&#10;Players roll a die and move along the track in any direction they like. When a player stops on a color they get a question of the appropriate category. If the player answers a question correctly while on a pie space, they get a pie of that color (assuming they don't already have it).

1301;Netrunner;"Netrunner is a cyberpunk-themed collectible card game.  The two players are the Corp (who wins by completing Agendas) and the Runner (who wins by infiltrating the Corp and liberating Agendas).&#10;&#10;Each side has a limited number of both actions and bits (money) to spend per turn; bits are gone once used, and actions must be spent to gain more.&#10;An important thing when evaluating the power of cards is to see the Bit per action ratio.&#10;&#10;One unique feature of this game is that the Runner physically moves on the &quot;board&quot; created by facedown Corp cards.  It has the feel of a &quot;capture the flag&quot; game, with the Runner moving in dataforts to steal Agendas from the Corp.&#10;&#10;Another unique feature is that the Cards are NOT the primary strategy of the game; in fact, players can win by simply &quot;playing with the rules&quot; itself (a concept difficult to understand if you've never played Netrunner).&#10;&#10;Both players play as both Corp and Runner in a game, one after the other, with each player's Runner going against the opponent's Corp.  A winning match provides 10 points and the loser scores points equal to the number of agenda points scored/liberated. The winner of the game is the one who has the most points in the 2 submatches.&#10;&#10;Though Netrunner is traditionally a two-player duel, there are formats that allow for more players (called &quot;The Big Sell Out&quot;).&#10;&#10;";1996;7.44651;2.9336;2;2;45;10;Card Game, Collectible Components, Science Fiction;netrunner cyberpunk collectible card corp complete agenda runner infiltrate corp liberating agenda limited number action bit money spend bit go action spend gain important thing evaluate power card bit action ratio unique runner physically create facedown corp card feel capture flag runner datafort steal agenda corp unique card primary strategy fact simply concept difficult understand ve netrunner corp runner runner go opponent corp match provide loser equal number agenda liberate winner submatche netrunner traditionally duel format allow call big sell
1303;The Squirrel Game;"A cute game for 5-10 year olds.&#10;   You are a squirrel running around the forest in a figure-eight track, picking up pine cones to bring back to your hoard (which you can enter once every lap).  The first squirrel to gather 15 pine cones in his hoard wins.  Spaces on the track give you one to three pine cones when you land on them, and the special die makes you lose your move now and then --instead, every squirrel gets a free pine cone.&#10;   The tricky part is that your wheelbarrow tips over and loses its contents whenever you exceed its capacity: six pine cones.  Every other squirrel laps the track in the opposite direction to yours, so there are plenty of squirrel encounters.  Every time you leap over another squirrel (going one way or the other), you can steal from or give to him up to three of your cones.  Therein lies all the strategy.&#10;&#10;";1987;5.3131;1.125;2;4;20;5;Children's Game;cute year old squirrel run forest figure track pick pine cone bring hoard enter lap squirrel gather pine cone hoard space track pine cone land special die make instead squirrel get free pine cone tricky wheelbarrow tip content exceed capacity pine cone squirrel lap track opposite direction plenty squirrel encounter time leap squirrel go way steal cone lie strategy

1313;1826: Railroading in France and Belgium from 1826;"1826 is an 18xx game set in France and Belgium and reflects the full period of Franco-Belgian railroading, from the origins to the present day. Both countries developed their railroad systems under close Government supervision and this is reflected in the game. The two major French nationalizations are covered, as are the post-war electrification and the introduction of high-speed rail (the TGV).&#10;&#10;1826 is a moderately complex game, designed for experienced players who are looking for something different than the usual round of 1830, 1856 and 1870. Due to the nature of the French political environment, this is not a game for extensive stock market manipulations, nor is it primarily a game of financial management. 1826 is an operationally-centered game in which technology management--getting the right trains on the right companies--is key.&#10;&#10;Companies are incrementally funded, and can buy and sell their own stock. Companies start out as five-share companies and can convert to ten-share companies upon reaching their destination. The first four train classes, including the first-generation permanent trains, have a range in hexes (2, 4, 6 or 10) rather than cities: the last two train classes, which are permanent, have a range in cities. There are two merger corporations, one of which may form relatively early (when the green tiles become available) and the other somewhat later (its first opportunity to form is when brown tiles become available).&#10;&#10;";2000;7.39317;3.8;2;6;210;14;Trains;xx set france belgium reflect period franco belgian railroad origin present day country develop railroad close government supervision reflect major french nationalization cover post war electrification introduction high speed rail tgv moderately complex experienced look different usual nature french political environment extensive stock market manipulation primarily financial management operationally center technology management get right train right company key company incrementally fund buy sell stock company start share company convert share company reach destination train class include generation permanent train range hex city train class permanent range city merger corporation form relatively early green tile available somewhat later opportunity form brown tile available
1315;Africa;"In Africa, players take on the role of explorers in uncharted Africa. The circular playing counters are placed upside down in random locations upon the various circles of the board. Each turn the player may elect to move his explorer to a revealed location anywhere on the board, or move twice, each turn moving 0, 1, or 2 adjacent revealed spaces. The explorer may then take an action (such as reveal an unrevealed tile, or move various revealed tiles to other locations). The tiles represent trade goods (of various sets), nomads, herds of animals, gold, diamonds, and monuments. When the 11th monument is revealed, the game ends. Players tally up their points and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;This being a Knizia game, there are various methods of scoring the revealed tiles, including immediate points, delayed points, opportunity points, and end points.&#10;&#10;Awarded &quot;Best Family Game&quot; title by Games Magazine in 2002.&#10;&#10;";2001;5.99858;1.7664;2;5;60;10;Exploration;africa role explorer uncharted africa circular playing place upside random location circle elect explorer reveal location twice adjacent reveal space explorer action reveal unrevealed tile reveal tile location tile represent trade good set nomad herd animal gold diamond monument th monument reveal end tally knizia method reveal tile include immediate delay opportunity end award good family title magazine

1331;Showdown Yahtzee;"Yahtzee meets a board game.  Players move pawns around a board with 12 open spaces and 4 'wild' spaces.  If you land on an open space, you can try to complete one of the 12 standard Yahtzee combinations (not counting the 'Yahtzee' -- more on that later).  If successful, you place the card for that combination on the space and a certain number of your chips to signify ownership.  If another player lands on that space later, they have to match or beat your roll to steal ownership of the board space.  Once a combination has been assigned to a space, it stays there -- so the number of combinations available to fill a blank space on the board decreases throughout the game.  If a player lands on a 'Wild' space, they can try for any combination, then move their piece to the appropriate space and steal ownership.  Also, if a player gets a Yahtzee, they can ignore the space they're on and claim ownership of any space on the board.  Once all combinations have been claimed, each player gets one more turn in which they're allowed to keep playing as long as they keep stealing ownership of a card.  Whoever has the most chips on the board at the end of the game wins.  A very interesting twist on the classic Yahtzee mechanism.&#10;&#10;";1991;5.80561;1.2667;2;4;30;8;Dice;yahtzee meet pawn open space wild space land open space try complete standard yahtzee combination count yahtzee later successful place card combination space certain number chip signify ownership land space later match beat steal ownership space combination assign space stay number combination available fill blank space decrease land wild space try combination piece appropriate space steal ownership get yahtzee ignore space claim ownership space combination claim get allow long steal ownership card chip end interesting twist classic yahtzee mechanism
1333;Boom-O;"Boom-O is a simple elimination card game from the makers of Uno. Each player gets 7 cards in hand and three time bomb cards in front of them. Most of the cards in the deck either increase or decrease the timer total. Other cards include familiar commands such as Skip, Reverse, Draw 1 (or 2) and Trade Hands.

1335;Gnadenlos!;"Gnadenlos! (Merciless!) is a game in which players enter a prospecting boom town and try to accumulate the most prestige points. Rather than doing the dirty work themselves, players hire adventurers to pan for their gold, fight their gun battles, and sit in for them in the poker games. Since the money hasn't yet come in, these rough-tough folk are hired merely with pieces of paper - IOUs. But on pay day the IOUs come due, and if a player can't pay off debts, then the vultures swoop in.&#10;&#10;Players bid for adventurer cards that will be used in various events - Gold Fever, High Noon, and the Poker Game. Each adventurer carries a number (a rating) for each of the three events. When it's time to play out an event, players place an adventurer card face down. All players simultaneously turn the cards over. The adventurer with the highest number pertaining to the event wins; the lowest loses (ties are usually kept as ties, with both receiving the benefits or penalties). In Gold Fever the winner and second highest receive gold, which may be exchanged for prestige points or used to pay off debts. In High Noon, the winner gets to pick back up two IOUs (not necessarily his or her own); the loser is shot and loses the adventurer card. Also the undertaker advances one space along a timing track. In the Poker Game, the winner moves forward on the prestige track; the loser moves backwards. The IOU cards used in bids for the adventurers are placed in rows along the board, each beside one of six dice symbols (showing 1 through 6). When as many rows as there are players in the game are filled, it's Pay Day. A die is rolled and the outermost card beside the corresponding die symbol is turned up. The player who owns that IOU must pay up. This continues until either all cards of one die symbol have been turned up, or a player cannot meet a debt. The unfortunate player in this case gets a vulture chip and moves back 5 spaces on the prestige track. The game ends either when one player has 3 vulture chips; a player reaches or passes the winning space on the prestige track; or the undertaker reaches his final space. When the game ends the player farthest along the prestige track wins.&#10;&#10;";2001;5.91477;1.925;3;4;45;10;American West, Bluffing;gnadenlos merciless enter prospect boom town try accumulate prestige dirty work hire adventurer pan gold fight gun battle sit poker money hasn t come rough tough folk hire merely piece paper ious pay day ious come t pay debt vulture swoop bid adventurer card event gold fever high noon poker adventurer carry number rating event time event place adventurer card face simultaneously card adventurer high number pertain event low tie usually keep tie receive benefit penalty gold fever winner second high receive gold exchange prestige pay debt high noon winner get pick ious necessarily loser shoot adventurer card undertaker advance space timing track poker winner forward prestige track loser backwards iou card bid adventurer place row dice symbol show row fill pay day die outermost card correspond die symbol own iou pay continue card die symbol meet debt unfortunate case get vulture chip space prestige track end vulture chip reach pass space prestige track undertaker reach final space end farth prestige track

1339;Dungeon!;"In many ways &quot;Dungeon!&quot; is similar to Dungeons &amp; Dragons, although much simplified and transformed into a board game. Players explore a dungeon that is divided into levels of increasing difficulty, fighting monsters for valuable treasure. As players venture deeper into the dungeon, the monsters become more difficult and the treasure more valuable. Several character classes each have slightly different fighting abilities &ndash; most notably the wizard, who can cast spells. Combat is simulated using dice; players roll the dice to attack a monster, and if unsuccessful, the dice are rolled to determine the effect of the monster's counter-attack.&#10;&#10;The winner is the first player to bring a certain amount of treasure back to the Dungeon's entrance.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Classic Dungeon&#10;    The New Dungeon&#10;&#10;&#10;";1975;5.99413;1.5548;1;8;60;8;Adventure, Exploration, Fantasy, Fighting;way dungeon similar dungeon amp dragon simplify transform explore dungeon divide increase difficulty fight monster valuable treasure venture deeply dungeon monster difficult treasure valuable character class slightly different fighting ndash notably wizard cast spell combat simulate dice dice attack monster unsuccessful dice determine effect monster attack winner bring certain treasure dungeon entrance reimplemente classic dungeon new dungeon

1353;Time's Up!;"Time's Up! is a charades-based party game for teams of two or more players (and is best with teams of two). Before the game begins, each player looks at several cards featuring famous historical or fictional characters and chooses some of them. Each player's cards are shuffled to form a deck, and this deck of famous names is used for each of the game's three rounds.&#10;&#10;In each round, team members take turns trying to get their teammates to guess as many names as possible in 30 seconds. In round 1, almost any kind of clue is allowed, and the cluegiver cannot pass on a card. In round 2, no more than one word can be used in each clue (but unlimited sounds and gestures are permitted); the cluegiver can pass on any card he likes, and the teammates can give only a single answer. In round 3, the cluegiver can use no words at all and can pass as often as he likes; again, teammates are allowed only a single guess. Give good physical clues in round 1, and they'll pay dividends down the road when you need to keep your mouth shut and gesture like a maniac before time's up!&#10;&#10;Time's Up! is based on the public domain game known as Celebrities.

1365;Olix;"Olix is a 2-player abstract strategy game.&#10;&#10;Each player places one piece on the board each turn. Once placed, pieces are never moved nor captured. The board is a simple 11 by 11 square grid.&#10;&#10;The players are attempting to form the largest formation in each of the four different types:&#10;&#10;    O = A rectangle occupying all exterior spaces of the rectangle (meaning there can be a hole or even filled with a friendly or opposing piece).&#10;    L = An L shaped formation (horizontal and vertical - not diagonal) with each leg having at least 3 spaces.&#10;    I = Any horizontal or vertical line of spaces of at least four spaces long.&#10;    X = Any diagonal line of at least four spaces long.&#10;&#10;&#10;Adjacent to the board is a scoreboard showing the lowest possible values for each formation:&#10;&#10;    O = 4, 6, 8, 9&#10;    L = 5, 6, 7, 8&#10;    I = 4, 5, 6, 7 &#10;    X = 4, 5, 6, 7 &#10;&#10;&#10;The player with the largest O, L, I, or X, marks its value on the scoreboard. If both players are tied for the largest formation of a type, both mark their scores on the scoreboard.&#10;&#10;The game ends when either player has an automatic win or when they concede that no further higher scoring formations can be made. The board should be about 66% full at this point and there simply won't be room for any higher scoring formations to be placed. The winner is the first player to form a formation larger than the scoreboard can handle (an automatic win), or at the end of game, the player who won more scoring columns than their opponent, wins. Ties are broken by the player with the furthest advanced scoring marker.&#10;&#10;Originally published in spielbox magazine.&#10;&#10;";1994;5.98636;2.1429;2;2;30;8;Abstract Strategy;olix abstract strategy place piece place piece capture simple square grid attempt form large formation different o rectangle occupy exterior space rectangle mean hole fill friendly oppose piece l l shape formation horizontal vertical diagonal leg have space horizontal vertical line space space long x diagonal line space long adjacent scoreboard show low possible value formation o l x large o l x mark value scoreboard tie large formation mark scoreboard end automatic concede high formation simply t room high formation place winner form formation large scoreboard handle automatic end column opponent tie break furthest advanced marker originally publish spielbox magazine

When all of the horses have a speed card on them, the one with the lowest speed card is eliminated.

1377;Danger;"In Danger, players draw numbered and colored cards, trying to collect as many points as possible in each color each round without exceeding the limit of 15 points.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player draws the top card from the deck and places it in front of her in a row for cards of that color; some cards are multicolor, and the player chooses in which row to play these cards. After laying a second card in the round, a player has the option of securing a row at the end of each turn. To secure a row, the player must not have the lowest total in that color when compared to the other players; the player secures a row by turning the last card in that row 90&ordm;. A player can secure only one row each turn.&#10;&#10;If a player exceeds a total of 15 points in a row, that row is now blocked and worth 0 points; the player turns those cards face-down.&#10;&#10;If a player draws a colored card for a row either secured or blocked, she must discard the card. The next player in turn order has the option of taking this discarded card instead of drawing randomly from the deck.&#10;&#10;Once the fourth row of any player is secured or blocked, the round ends immediately. Whoever has the fewest points in a color (with blocked rows worth 0 points) scores nothing for this color; all other players score points equal to the numbers showing in this color in their row. Players then empty their rows and continue playing with the cards remaining in the deck. After five complete rounds, the player with the highest total score wins.&#10;&#10;";2001;4.42288;1.125;3;5;30;8;Card Game;danger draw numbered colored card try collect possible color exceed limit draw card deck place row card color card multicolor choose row card lay second card option secure row end secure row low total color compare secure row card row ordm secure row exceed total row row block worth card face draw colored card row secured block discard card order option take discard card instead draw randomly deck fourth row secure block end immediately few color block row worth color equal number show color row row continue card remain deck complete high total

1387;Alaska;"Players compete to collect their container blocks from a central island and return them across the ice sheet to their respective camps before the Spring thaw.&#10;&#10;The game runs in two parts; Winter as the players lay ice tiles across the hex board to the central island, and Spring as the thaw allows the players to remove ice tiles. In your turn, you draw from deck 1 which shows a 1,2 or 3 hex tile and a number on the winter/spring header/footer. After placing the tile in the hex-board, you then draw an action card from deck 2. Most are played immediately (Polar Bear, Frostbite, Found Container) but others you can save and use later (Robbery, Fog, Helicopter). Then the player can move their truck up to free places.&#10;&#10;A 3-hex ice tile counts as one space, so a player with a shorter route may profit early, but when the thaw comes, the other players can quickly remove the shortcut. The Polar Bear acts as a barrier and is often moved around. The other action cards can be beneficial (Found Container means you simply put a container in your truck where you are) or hinder you (Frostbite means you must drop the container and your truck jumps to your camp). Players can only rob dropped containers, not other trucks.&#10;&#10;The Spring thaw only comes when all the ice tiles that can be placed are down. You keep using deck 1, but simply read the alternative symbol for the thaw. There are fewer thaws, so the ice sheet stays active for some time, forcing players to make longer detours. You cannot remove an ice tile if it holds a truck or the bear, and tiles with dropped containers only go last. The game sort of stops when no containers can be collected, but since Helicopter action cards allow you to jump from place to place, the actual end-point is not precise.&#10;&#10;";1979;5.88974;1.4516;2;4;60;12;Transportation;compete collect container block central island return ice sheet respective camp spring thaw run part winter lie ice tile hex central island spring thaw allow remove ice tile draw deck show hex tile number winter spring header footer place tile hex draw action card deck immediately polar bear frostbite find container save use later robbery fog helicopter truck free place hex ice tile count space short route profit early thaw come quickly remove shortcut polar bear act barrier action card beneficial find container mean simply container truck hinder frostbite mean drop container truck jump camp rob drop container truck spring thaw come ice tile place deck simply read alternative symbol thaw few thaw ice sheet stay active time force long detour remove ice tile hold truck bear tile drop container sort stop container collect helicopter action card allow jump place place actual end precise
1389;Alles oder Nichts;"Game material&#10;48 playing cards&#10;42 trick indicator cards; 6 colored sets with values of 0 - 6&#10;1 scorepad&#10;1 pen&#10;1 rulebook&#10;&#10;Description of the game&#10;The main task of the 3 - 6 players is to correctly assess their cards. They use a trick indicator card to declare the number of tricks they expect to take. If they're right, they get a bonus. It's also up to the players to decide whether they will openly announce the tricks they expect to take or whether they keep it secret. But beware! A face-up trick indicator card increases the possibility that the other players will be able to influence the outcome. With increased risk it's true that you get: &quot;Alles oder Nichts (Double or Nothing)&quot;.&#10;&#10;A game last for seven rounds. Each player receives:&#10;in the 1st round - 6 cards&#10;in the 2nd round - 5 cards&#10;in the 3rd round - 4 cards&#10;in the 4th round - 3 cards&#10;in the 5th round - 4 cards&#10;in the 6th round - 5 cards&#10;in the 7th round - 6 cards&#10;&#10;After the cards are dealt, the dealer turns over the top card of the remaining cards. The color of this card is the trump color. After distributing the cards, players take the playing cards into their hand. Each player now judges for himself how many tricks he thinks he can take. Players select the appropriate card from their trick indicator cards and place it face-down in front of themselves&#10;&#10;Once all players have made their decision, the dealer, starting with the player to his left, asks each player if he wants to openly announce the number of tricks he plans to take (by turning over his trick indicator card) or if he wishes to keep it secret. Once each player has indicated his decision, the dealer asks the other players in clockwise order until all players, including the dealer have indicated their decision. Turning over the trick indicator card brings a higher risk but also potentially more points.&#10;&#10;Rules of play:&#10;&#10;Players must follow suit (play the same color as the card that was lead) if it is possible for them to do so.&#10;&#10;If a player cannot follow suit, he has two possibilities:&#10;1. Play trump - play a card of the trump color&#10;2. Throw off - play a card that is neither the trump color nor the color that was lead. You can never win a trick when you throw off.&#10;&#10;If no trump was played, the player who played the highest card of the suit that was lead wins the trick.&#10;If trump was played, the player who played the highest trump card wins the trick.&#10;&#10;If the trump color was lead, it must also be followed. If a player does not have any cards in the trump color, he must throw off a card with another color.&#10;&#10;Scoring&#10;Secret trick indicator cards:&#10;Players whose trick indicator cards were face-down get one point for each trick that they took. Players who took exactly as many tricks as noted on their trick indicator card get a 3 point bonus.&#10;&#10;Openly declared trick indicator cards:&#10;Players whose trick indicator cards were turned face-up only get points get if they take exactly as many tricks as they predicted. If they fulfill this condition, their score is equal to the number of tricks they took multiplied by 2 plus the 3 point bonus.&#10;&#10;Goal of the game&#10;The goal of the game is to have the most points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;";1988;5.05882;2.0;3;6;30;8;Card Game;material playing card trick indicator card color set value scorepad pen rulebook description main task correctly assess card use trick indicator card declare number trick expect right bonus decide openly announce trick expect secret beware face trick indicator card increase possibility able influence outcome increase risk true alle oder nicht double seven receive st card nd card rd card th card th card th card th card card deal dealer card remain card color card trump color distribute card playing card hand judge trick think select appropriate card trick indicator card place face decision dealer start left ask want openly announce number trick plan trick indicator card wish secret indicate decision dealer ask clockwise order include dealer indicate decision trick indicator card bring high risk potentially follow suit color card lead possible follow suit possibility trump card trump color throw card trump color color lead trick throw trump high card suit lead trick trump high trump card trick trump color lead follow card trump color throw card color secret trick indicator card trick indicator card face trick take take exactly trick note trick indicator card bonus openly declare trick indicator card trick indicator card face exactly trick predict fulfill condition equal number trick take multiply plus bonus end

1397;Crash Pilot;"Crash Pilot rewards players who can quickly match shapes and colors. There are six rows of cards representing airplane stunts, and no row may contain two cards of the same color or shape. Each turn a player draws a card from his pile (or on the first turn from a neutral pile), then all players try to find a legal placement for that card; the first player to do so draws a card from his pile to start the next turn. Calling an incorrect row earns that player a crash chip, and three crash chips eliminates him from the game. The first player to run out of cards wins.&#10;&#10;Crash Pilot has also been published with a grocery store theme as Check Out.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.42768;1.125;2;5;20;6;Aviation / Flight, Children's Game, Real-time;crash pilot reward quickly match shape color row card represent airplane stunt row contain card color shape draw card pile neutral pile try find legal card draw card pile start call incorrect row earn crash chip crash chip eliminate run card crash pilot publish grocery store check

1403;Turn the Tide;"Players are dealt a hand of 12 from a deck of 1-60 (the remainder go back in the box for the whole game), and then lay out marker cards that show the other players the strength of their hand. Another scoring deck of 24 has values of 1-12; two cards from this deck are laid face up.&#10;&#10;Players choose one card from their hand in secret and reveal them simultaneously. The highest value played takes the lowest scoring card, which goes face-up to a pile in front of you. The second highest takes the other card likewise. Remaining cards are discounted. Then look at everyone's face-up deck: the highest scoring player turns one of his or her marker cards over! (The original game had cockatoos becoming cuckoos; this edition is themed on lifesavers). At the end of a round, players score according to their markers cards that they managed to save (cockatoos or life-savers).&#10;&#10;There is a further twist! Players then pick up all their playing hand, and pass it clockwise. So as each round commences, you are using the cards previously used by your neighbor! Are you smarter? Can you make a better fist of the same hand your neighbor had? Play out rounds until all players have had each hand.

1407;Alcatraz;"Players try to escape from the prison island Alcatraz in this quite abstract game. Board resembles a chess board, it's a 9x9 grid where players must move their pieces from one end to the other. Each piece can move horizontally or vertically as many spaces as the player wishes, but there are few complications: the guards. Each row has a guard. Whenever a piece moves to a row, the guard on that row moves as many spaces towards the piece as the piece moved (if you move three rows up, the guard on that row moves three spaces towards you). If the guard catches you, the move is illegal. Of course, it's legal to make the guards catch other players' pieces... The first player to have three of their four pieces escape wins.&#10;&#10;Alcatraz is fun, quick game and a nice brain-teaser, especially with more than two players when the board gets quite crowded.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.50932;1.9091;2;4;30;10;Abstract Strategy;try escape prison island alcatraz abstract resemble chess x grid piece end piece horizontally vertically space wish complication guard row guard piece row guard row space piece piece row guard row space guard catch illegal course legal guard catch piece piece escape alcatraz fun quick nice brain teaser especially get crowded
1409;Spawn: The Game;"While this is essentially a Parchessi variant, the game mechanics were well adapted to the comic book character Spawn, as he was expressed at the time.&#10;&#10;Players play cards from their hands which may affect themselves, affect another player or function as tiles on the board.  In this case, they alter the movement point cost to enter that space.&#10;&#10;Next, players roll dice to build up power (movement) points and move their figure appropriately.&#10;&#10;As in Parcheesi, the first player to complete one trip around the board wins.&#10;&#10;Other items spice up this mix.  Power chips may be spent to add to your roll, but must be spent before you roll.  The Violator pawn sends a Spawn pawn back.

1413;Attack Sub;"Attack Sub is a card based wargame similar to Up Front. The topic is modern submarine warfare (Mostly US/Nato vs. Soviet/Warsaw Pact, but there is an occasional Falklands War scenario.)&#10;&#10;Each player has one or more submarines and/or surface ships. Each ship is represented on an individual large card with counters showing current contact status and damage.&#10;&#10;Each player plays cards to increase their &quot;contact level&quot; relative to their opponent. Contact level abstractly represents relative position and sonar readings. It is possible for one ship to have a better contact on his enemy than the enemy has on him. When high enough contact level is reached, torpedoes can be fired.&#10;&#10;";1991;6.65731;2.2424;2;2;30;12;Card Game, Modern Warfare, Nautical, Wargame;attack sub card base wargame similar topic modern submarine warfare nato vs soviet warsaw pact occasional falkland war submarine surface ship ship represent individual large card show current contact status damage card increase contact relative opponent contact abstractly represent relative position sonar reading possible ship well contact enemy enemy high contact reach torpedo fire

1417;Alibi;"The Whodunit Card Game: &quot;Murder in the big city, and you must solve the crime.  Brenda's dead, and foul play is suspected. To win, find out who did it, where, when, how, and why.&quot;&#10;&#10;This is a card game that shares some similarities with Clue, but adds some other questions to the mix, like what time of day did it happen, and what was the killer's motive? To the usual process of elimination and deduction found in most Clue-type games, they've added scoring elements.  You can collect sets of clues and reveal them to score points.  Obviously, though, this aids the other players as well by eliminating some categories.&#10;&#10;You start with a number of cards, each of which contains a specific clue. As play progresses, you can attempt to accumulate all the clues in a category, which will earn you points based on what turn you choose to reveal your set.&#10;&#10;Each turn, you are allowed to direct a question to a specific player.  The question must be answerable with a number.  For example, you may ask &quot;How many Cookie Carpenter cards do you have?&quot;  or  &quot;How many Jealousy cards have you seen?&quot;  Doing this will help you eliminate some of the icons (clues) on your score sheet.&#10;&#10;Your other option during your turn is to make an accusation. You need to be careful though, since this also will end the game! On the other hand, you do get some bonus points for being the First Accuser.&#10;&#10;Cards are passed after each player's turn. For the first round it is only one, but it increases by 1 for every round the game lasts.&#10;&#10;Once someone decides to accuse, all players can make any guesses they want to, filling in the answers they've come up with for each category (Suspect, Place, Weapon, Emotion).  You can also fill in the specific answer within a category for more points. The problem with guessing, though, is that wrong answers result in negative points, and the First Accuser loses double!&#10;&#10;";1993;5.51394;1.7925;3;10;45;10;Card Game, Deduction, Murder / Mystery;whodunit card murder big city solve crime brenda dead foul suspect find card share similarity clue add question mix like time day happen killer motive usual process elimination deduction find clue ve add element collect set clue reveal obviously aid eliminate category start number card contain specific clue progress attempt accumulate clue category earn base choose reveal set allow direct question specific question answerable number example ask cookie carpenter card jealousy card see help eliminate icon clue sheet option accusation need careful end hand bonus accuser card pass increase last decide accuse guess want fill answer ve come category suspect place weapon emotion fill specific answer category problem guess wrong answer result negative accuser double
1419;Pylos;"In Pylos, you want to be one who places the final ball on top of the pyramid. Sounds simple enough, right?&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player has fifteen balls, either light or dark, and they take turns placing them on a game board that has sixteen indentations on it in a 4x4 grid. Once four balls have been placed next to one another in a square, a ball can be placed on top of them, forming a second level of play. Players can then place balls on this second level, eventually allowing a ball to be placed on the third level &ndash; and once that level is full, which requires only four balls, a final ball can be placed on the fourth level, with that player winning the game.&#10;&#10;If a player forms a square of his own color &ndash; that is, four balls placed next to one another on the same level &ndash; that player can remove one or two of his balls (that don't support anything) from anywhere on the board and place them in his reserve, thereby giving him more balls to place in the future. Whenever a player forms a square that's not entirely his own color, he can &quot;stack&quot; one of his pieces &ndash; that is, he can take any ball and place it on this square, locking some pieces in place and making a move without having to place a piece from his reserve.&#10;&#10;The rules include a variant for children (that removes the square bonus) and one for experts (that allows a player to return 1-2 balls to his reserve when he creates a line of his color).&#10;&#10;Reimplements&#10;&#10;&#10;    Strat-O-Sphere&#10;&#10;&#10;";1993;6.30798;1.9187;2;2;10;8;Abstract Strategy;pylo want place final ball pyramid sound simple right start ball light dark place sixteen indentation x grid ball place square ball place form second place ball second eventually allow ball place ndash require ball final ball place fourth form square color ndash ball place ndash remove ball don t support place reserve give ball place future form square entirely color piece ndash ball place square lock piece place make have place piece reserve include child remove square bonus expert allow return ball reserve create line color reimplement strat o sphere

Each player has a character card and a booklet (and sometimes special Tactics, Luck, or Spell cards) for one of about fifty (and growing) medieval-fantasy characters.  Characters can range from barbarian warriors to animated skeletons to elven archers to unicorns &mdash; even two different dragons.  Booklets are traded and, as each player selects a move, a reference grid in the books determine the results (wounds, off-balance maneuvers, and so on).  Combat continues until one fighter or the other expires.&#10;&#10;An interesting feature of the Lost Worlds system is that, under some versions of the rules, characters may improve their abilities as they gain experience.  In theory, you are supposed to keep track of your progress with each character, and if one is utterly killed, it will have to start over without its improved skills.&#10;&#10;Part of the Lost Worlds series of books.&#10;&#10;";1983;6.55732;1.6905;2;2;10;10;Book, Fantasy, Fighting, Medieval;entry allow discussion rating specific product release appear individual item page world popular entry alfred leonardi line book include ace ace character card booklet special tactic luck spell card grow medieval fantasy character character range barbarian warrior animate skeleton elven archer unicorns mdash different dragon booklet trade select reference grid book determine result wound balance maneuver combat continue fighter expire interesting world character improve gain experience theory suppose track progress character utterly kill start improve skill world series book
1423;Storm over Arnhem;"This is the first of the Area-Impulse games done by Avalon Hill which later included Thunder at Cassino, Turning Point: Stalingrad and Breakout Normandy. The game simulates the ferocious battle for the Arnhem Bridge on September 18-21, 1944.&#10;&#10;The game begins with the British holding the area around the bridge, surrounded by the Germans. They try to hold out for as long as they can.&#10;&#10;Each full turn covers 8 hours and includes many mini-turns (or impulses). Each impulse, the player can move or fire a small number units. Once moved or fired, the units are &quot;committed&quot; and cannot move or fire again until the next turn.&#10;&#10;Combat is handled by calculating attack and defense values with each side adding the roll of 2 dice. The difference (if the attacker has the higher total) in final point values is the number of casualty points the defender must lose by retreating or destroying units.&#10;&#10;The games is of relatively low complexity for a wargame and rates 3 (out of 10) on AH's difficulty scale.&#10;&#10;";1981;7.19343;2.8992;2;2;300;12;Wargame, World War II;area impulse avalon hill later include thunder cassino turning stalingrad breakout normandy simulate ferocious battle arnhem bridge september begin british hold area bridge surround german try hold long cover hour include mini impulse impulse fire small number unit fire unit commit fire combat handle calculate attack defense value add dice difference attacker high total final value number casualty defender retreat destroy unit relatively low complexity wargame rate ah difficulty scale

Upon landing, the remaining force tries to reach targets  (sub pens, caissons, docked ships, supply tanks, etc.) and destroy them.&#10;&#10;The German guards are handled by the game system and arrive via random draw and placement and move by most direct route to the nearest British commando.

1443;Alpha Blitz;"Alpha Blitz consists of two different games.&#10;&#10;Alpha is a word game for 2 players. there are 98 cards with letters on them and 10 blitz cards showing a lightning bolts. These are shuffled together and six are laid out between the players. Each player gets 3 cards in their start hand. On your turn you try to make the longest word possible with the six letters showing on the table using each letter as many times as you want. For example you could make the word letters with the letters L, E, T, R, and S showing. Each turn you must cover one letter with a card from your hand and then draw another card. You may do this before or after you make a word. If you cover a letter with a blitz card that pile is permanently out so as the game progresses there are less letters to use. You receive 1 point for making a word. 1 point for every letter in the word more then the number of letter piles. You also get 1 point for each J, K, Qu, X and Z you use. The game ends when there are only 2 letter piles left.&#10;&#10;Blitz is a word game for 3-6 players. Each player has a hand of 3 cards. 2 cards are placed face down in front of each player. All cards are turned up at the same time. The first player to call out a word that can be formed with the letters showing gets 1 point plus 1 point for each J, K, Qu, X and Z they used. The second player to call out a word gets 2 points but the word must be longer then the previous word. This continues until all players have called out a word or passed due to not seeing a legal word. Each round is started by covering a letter from your hand. The game ends when one player has both letter piles covered with a blitz card.&#10;&#10;Alpha Blitz was awarded the title &quot;Best Word Game&quot; by Games Magazine in 1999.&#10;&#10;";1998;4.875;1.8333;2;6;30;10;Card Game, Word Game;alpha blitz consist different alpha word card letter blitz card show lightning bolt shuffle lay get card start hand try long word possible letter show table letter time want example word letter letter l e t r show cover letter card hand draw card word cover letter blitz card pile permanently progress letter use receive make word letter word number letter pile j k qu x z use end letter pile leave blitz word hand card card place face card time word form letter show get plus j k qu x z second word get word long previous word continue call word pass see legal word start cover letter hand end letter pile cover blitz card alpha blitz award title good word magazine

1447;1841: Railways in Northern Italy;"1841 is the apex (or nadir depending on your point of view) of 18xx stock-market manipulation. Set in Northern Italy during a period of rapid political change (borders for playable hexes change twice during the course of the game) the game is one of the most difficult even for experienced 18xx players.&#10;&#10;The greatest innovations center on the ability of companies to own shares in other public companies and the merging of companies. Train obsolescence is rapid and unforgiving, and it is quite possible for forced-purchase trains to be obsolete before they get a chance to run. Capitalization is on a per-share basis throughout the game and train prices are steep &gt;1400 for an 8 train - the largest.&#10;&#10;There are 8 historical corporations and eight, named but ahistorical &quot;generic&quot; corporations. These are normally used simply as investment vehicles to maximize the amount of capital available to &quot;successful&quot; companies close to Milan. Northern Italy is mountainous, especially near the off-board Alpine areas and to the South of the map, making progress slow and expensive for the outlying historical companies.&#10;&#10;1841 has a reputation as a very long game, but is not necessarily much longer than games, such as 1870, which have a very large bank. It can be completed in four hours.&#10;&#10;Chris Lawson's game kit is one version that is available and is of his usual high (for a game kit) quality. A large amount of time with scissors and craft knife to cut out the stock and tiles can be expected.  Deep Thought Games now publishes 1841v2 which incorporates changes by Manlio Manzini to address some of the perceived shortcomings with the original which was designed by Federico Vellani with Manlio as a co-author.&#10;&#10;Description by Steve Thomas:&#10;&#10;1841 is the 18xx game of choice for many players, though some hate it. Designed, and originally published as 1839 by Federico Vellani, it is set in northern Italy. The McGuffin here is that 1841 is the 18xx game which is least about actually building a railway and most about manipulating the stock market and managing the extremely fierce train obsolescence. Route development has its place, but unless the players can get the rest of the game about right they are doomed, and it is this which polarizes players' views of the game. When it first became available it whetted the slightly jaded palates of some players since the dividing line between success and abject failure is so narrow. 1841 achieves this by allowing companies to buy and sell shares in each other, and to merge with one another. These factors result in frequent and hard-to-predict changes to the order in which the companies operate. It's exciting and dynamic, and the only real downside, at least for &quot;the financiers who've had enough of the engineers&quot;, to misquote the 1853 box art, is the length of the game. At typically seven hours it cannot sensibly be played in an evening. Even so, the game is usually well worth the investment of time, though it's certainly not for the novice.&#10;&#10;";1994;7.91335;4.4773;2;8;300;14;Economic, Post-Napoleonic, Trains, Transportation;apex nadir depend view xx stock market manipulation set northern italy period rapid political change border playable hex change twice course difficult experienced xx great innovation center company share public company merging company train obsolescence rapid unforgiving possible forced purchase train obsolete chance run capitalization share basis train price steep gt train large historical corporation name ahistorical generic corporation normally simply investment vehicle maximize capital available successful company close milan northern italy mountainous especially near alpine area south map make progress slow expensive outlying historical company reputation long necessarily long large bank complete hour chris lawson kit available usual high kit quality large time scissor craft knife cut stock tile expect deep thought publish v incorporate change manlio manzini address perceive shortcoming original federico vellani manlio co author description steve thomas xx hate originally publish federico vellani set northern italy mcguffin xx actually build railway manipulate stock market manage extremely fierce train obsolescence route development place rest right doom polarize view available whet slightly jade palate dividing line success abject failure narrow achieve allow company buy sell share merge factor result frequent hard predict change order company operate exciting dynamic real downside financier ve engineer misquote box art length typically seven hour sensibly evening usually worth investment time certainly novice

1463;Girl Genius: The Works;"This is a non-collectible reworking of the CCG XXXenophile.  While XXXenophile's theme and artwork were rated R, Girl Genius can be played by families without grandma getting embarrassed.  (However, a couple cards do feature scantily dressed women.)&#10;&#10;Each player gets a five-card hand and 12 cards are laid out face-down in a patchwork pattern.  Each card has colored symbols along each side, a point value, and special instructions. On your turn, you turn over one face-down card then spin any face-up card 180 degrees.  After spinning, if any of the symbols on the edges of the spun card match the symbols on one or more of the surrounding cards, you &quot;pop&quot; the card(s) with the most matching symbols.  &quot;Popping&quot; a card means you must follow the instructions on the card (whether helpful or harmful) and then (usually) add it to your score pile.  Cards in your hand are used to replace any popped cards.  The game is played until one player has 100 points or has captured a combination of submarine and dirigible cards.&#10;&#10;Unlike most of Cheapass Games's games, this one is professionally manufactured with full color, laminated cards with rounded corners.&#10;&#10;";2001;6.04974;1.9355;2;4;30;10;Card Game, Comic Book / Strip;non collectible reworking ccg xxxenophile xxxenophile artwork rate r girl genius family grandma get embarrassed couple card scantily dress woman get card hand card lay face patchwork pattern card color symbol value special instruction face card spin face card degree spin symbol edge spun card match symbol surround card pop card matching symbol pop card mean follow instruction card helpful harmful usually add pile card hand replace pop card capture combination submarine dirigible card unlike cheapass professionally manufacture color laminate card rounded corner
1465;Wizard;"The trick-taking game Wizard uses a sixty-card deck that consists of the traditional 52-card deck (1-13 in four suits) along with four Wizards (high) and four Jesters (low).&#10;&#10;Players compete over multiple rounds based on the number of players, and whoever ends with the highest score wins. In each round, players are dealt a hand of cards &mdash; one card in the first round, two cards in the second, three in the third, etc. &mdash; then trump is determined by flipping the top card of the undealt deck; if a suit is revealed, that suit is trump, while if the card turned up is a Jester, it is turned down and there is no trump for that round. If the card turned up is a Wizard, the dealer chooses one of the 4 suits as the trump suit. The dealer cannot choose &quot;no trump&quot;. On the last round of each game all cards are dealt out so there is no trump. Players then state how many tricks they expect to win in the round.&#10;&#10;The playing and winning of the tricks uses mostly standard trick-taking rules. If a player leads a suited card, then all other players must follow suit, if possible. If a player leads a Jester, then the second player determines the suit led. If a player leads a Wizard, then those who follow can play whatever they want. However, in all cases a player may always play a Wizard or Jester, even if they hold cards in the suit led.&#10;&#10;After each player has played a card, determine the winner of the trick as follows: If one or more Wizards were played, the player of the first Wizard wins the trick, collects the cards, and leads to the next trick. If not, whoever played the highest trump wins the trick. If not, whoever played the highest card of the suit led wins the trick. If all players played Jesters, whoever played the first Jester wins.&#10;&#10;After all tricks have been played, players tally their score for the round. If a player matched their bid, winning exactly as many tricks as stated at the start of the round, they score 20 points, plus 10 points for each trick taken. If a player missed their bid, they lose 10 points for each trick that they were off, whether they took more or fewer than predicted.&#10;&#10;A common variant in Wizard is to not allow the total number of tricks bid in a round to match the round number, thereby forcing (at least) one player to be off each round.&#10;&#10;";1984;6.98434;1.7061;3;6;45;10;Card Game, Fantasy;trick take wizard use card deck consist traditional card deck suit wizard high jester low compete multiple base number end high deal hand card mdash card card second etc mdash trump determine card undealt deck suit reveal suit trump card jester trump card wizard dealer choose suit trump suit dealer choose trump card deal trump state trick expect playing winning trick use standard trick take lead suited card follow suit possible lead jester second determine suit lead lead wizard follow want case wizard jester hold card suit lead card determine winner trick follow wizard wizard trick collect card lead trick high trump trick high card suit lead trick jester jester trick tally match bid exactly trick state start plus trick take miss bid trick take few predict common wizard allow total number trick bid match number force

So you must answer with a number (for hexagonal precision) or a number and a letter (for triangular).  The four sides of the pyramid are earned by answering a question with triangular precision, one for each zone on the map (Americas, Europe, Water, and Universal - which is Africa, Asia and the other 3 zones).&#10;&#10;The rubi (top of the pyramid) is earned by first having the four sides done, then answering a final question.

You can deactivate the cameras, and you can even cut off the power to the entire museum to mask your movements.  Another advantage is that the thief gets a turn after every detective's individual turn.&#10;&#10;Another problem for the detectives is the fact that, once the thief has picked up a painting, she can take her next turn before removing the painting from the gameboard.  The good guys know the vicinity, but won't know her exact location, as the thief is now up to 3 squares away from that spot. If a detective ever spots you with the naked eye, secret movement is over, and the thief's token is placed on the board for all to see.  This can get frantic, since the thief can only move 1-3 spaces, while detectives roll a d6 for movement!&#10;&#10;The thief player has to decide when to attempt a getaway. The catch is, some of the windows and doors are locked.  There are actual lock pieces, and you must flip over the one you are attempting to open (instant detective frenzy!). If she has stolen 3 paintings (in a one-off game), and manages to get out, she wins.  In a tournament style game, each player gets a turn at being the thief, so the number of paintings needed will vary based on the other players' scores.&#10;&#10;1991 Mensa Select&#10;&#10;Also selected by Family Fun Magazine as one of the best games.&#10;&#10;Original name by inventors was Heist.

1486;Plunder;"A very strange game from the Thomson Bros.  Each player attempts to collect a set of 4 items and deliver them to his home.  You go to stores owned by other players and buy them but early in the game it becomes night and then the only recourse is to steal them.  It looks like a monopoly clone on the surface but is much more chaotic.  One player plays a thief who can move pretty quickly using special paths.  One player is the Mayor who has a lot of money.  The other players play merchants who have a store and residence.&#10;&#10;4 tokens are placed in each store and any player (except a thief) may enter a store and buy one.  You can only carry one item at a time but you may drop any item at any time.  You can enter stores that are closed and residences to steal items but if caught you may end up going to jail which is harsh.&#10;&#10;This game falls in the light and wacky catagory.&#10;&#10;";1997;9.3;2.0;4;6;90;10;;strange thomson bros attempt collect set item deliver home store own buy early night recourse steal look like monopoly clone surface chaotic thief pretty quickly special path mayor lot money merchant store residence token place store thief enter store buy carry item time drop item time enter store closed residence steal item catch end go jail harsh fall light wacky catagory

Marion Crawford, Ave Roma Immortalis, II, IS&#10;&#10;Seven centuries of history are contained in this box.&#10;&#10;Imperium Romanum II is the game of the Roman Empire -the greatest and most glorious empire the world has ever known. The rules book describes the intricacies of Roman political, economic, and military conflict. The game-map portrays the whole Roman world, from Britannia to Parthia, in exacting detail, and the 800 game counters depict individual legions, fleets, and auxiliary units.

Many games claim to be playable; players will be very pleased at how elegantly Imperium Romanum II joins scholarly historical concern to an eminently playable game system. In short, Imperium Romanum II is the definitive game of the Roman Empire.&#10;&#10;Imperium Romanum II is based on West End Games classic Imperium Romanum. More accurate, informative and attractive maps, an increase in the number of unit colors and types, rules substantially revised with an eye to readability, clarity, and historical accuracy, and the addition of new scenarios (and the elimination of some older ones) are just some of the improvements players will find in this thorough revision.&#10;&#10;What You Will Do In Imperium Romanum II &#10;Storm the walls of Rome; plunder provinces; reconquer the Empire; strive for the Imperial purple; war against the Parthians; fight great battles at sea; fight barbarian invasions; mass barbarian hordes to plunder the West; conquer Gaul; cross the Rubicon. &#10;Fight against aristocratic oppression, or for aristocratic stability.

Each player gets 10 action points each turn to go back in time and collect dinosaurs.  You start your turn by rolling a die and putting out that many new dinos for hunting.

1501;Masterpiece;"Van Gogh, Rembrandt, Renoir --- paintings by the world's most famous artists are on the auction block, for sale to the highest bidder. How high will you bid before the tension and bluffing get to you? And how good's your eye --- can you spot a forgery when you buy one?&#10;&#10;The MASTERPIECE game combines the excitement of a fast-paced board game with the glamour and sophistication of a game that deals with fine art. Some of the world's greatest paintings, illustrated in full-color postcards, are an integral part of gameplay.&#10;&#10;The high-stakes world of international art --- and the power plays of an auction --- will entertain and enlighten as you join a particularly eccentric group of collectors who've all come in search of a MASTERPIECE.&#10;&#10;Each player takes the role of an art collector and tries to amass the greatest fortune in cash and the value of art pieces in their collection.&#10;&#10;The painting cards are randomized and placed face down in a stack.  Matching size value cards are also mixed and placed face down in a stack.  These value cards indicate the worth of the painting ranging from forgery (zero) to $1,000,000.  Each player receives an equal sum of money and one painting with value card which are clipped together so that all players can see the painting and only the owning player can see the value.  When paintings are drawn from the stack, a value card is clipped to them in this fashion.  Players move around the board by die roll and land on spaces that allow the player to collect money from the bank, receive a painting from the stack, sell a painting to the bank for its value, sell a painting to the bank for a specified amount, auction one of their paintings to the highest bidding opponent, or auction the top painting in the stack to the highest bidder.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the painting stack is exhausted.

1502;Hotel;"Hotel Tycoon, first published as Hotels, is a Monopoly-like game in which hotel tycoons try to buy and build the best hotels in the world and compete for guests. The game caters two to four players, ages eight and up. An average game lasts about 90 minutes.&#10;&#10;Players try to buy and build the best hotels in this game, earning the most money or bankrupting their opponents. A successful hotel consists of three components: the land on which it's built, the hotel buildings, and the entrances by which guests arrive in the hotels. All three components need to be bought separately with in-game money. As in Monopoly, money is earned by players who end up on one of the entrances of your hotels, after their dice roll. The more luxurious the hotel, the more money a guest will earn you. Money you can use to build extensions to your existing hotels, buying new entrances or pay other players when you arrive at their hotels.&#10;&#10;The game consists out of cardboard, three-dimensional hotel buildings, recreational grounds and entrance stairs that can be placed on the large game board.&#10;&#10;";1974;5.52919;1.3944;2;4;60;8;Economic;hotel tycoon publish hotel monopoly like hotel tycoon try buy build good hotel world compete guest cater age average last minute try buy build good hotel earn money bankrupt opponent successful hotel consist component land build hotel building entrance guest arrive hotel component need buy separately money monopoly money earn end entrance hotel dice luxurious hotel money guest earn money use build extension exist hotel buy new entrance pay arrive hotel consist cardboard dimensional hotel building recreational ground entrance stair place large
1503;Mid-East Peace;"Mid-East Peace is one of those great games where luck really doesn't play a part, once initial country selection is made.&#10;&#10;The game is set during the pressure cooker situation of the early 90's and the tension of the game certainly reflects this. Players out-maneuver and out-bluff one another so as to gain the riches of the region, while making sure they spend enough of the &quot;oil/money&quot; to ensure the safety of their state. The tension is kept up by secret deployment of forces and the continual angst of balancing resource spending with the saving necessary to come off the winner. It is, usually, the richest player, the one who has probably spent least on 'defense' throughout the game that will come off the victor. But, the twist is that the game can end in war or peace, and there are different victory conditions depending on which of the two outcomes it ends in. A very hard balance to maintain.&#10;&#10;";1990;5.13079;2.4375;2;6;180;12;Modern Warfare, Political, Wargame;mid east peace great luck doesn t initial country selection set pressure cooker situation early tension certainly reflect maneuver bluff gain rich region make sure spend oil money ensure safety state tension keep secret deployment force continual angst balance resource spending saving necessary come winner usually rich probably spend defense come victor twist end war peace different condition depend outcome end hard balance maintain

1512;Hexagony;"This game was originally published by the designer as Bin'Fa under the company name Taoist Arts, Inc. It was released a few years later as Hexagony by Avalon Hill, and then again as Bin'Fa by the designer under the company name Kenterprises. The Avalon Hill version has slightly different rules. Alan Moon is credited with development of this version. Bin'Fa will be re-released February 2015 after undergoing numerous alterations and rule changes from its previous incarnations.&#10;&#10;Bin'Fa/2015 Edition is described by the Publisher/Designer:&#10;&#10;Bin&rsquo;Fa is a game of strategy for 2 to 6 players, each of whom controls an army of twelve units, a general and a supply pawn. In multiple army games, each player controls either two or three armies. The object of the game is to capture the opposing army units by surrounding them, thereby removing them from play.&#10;&#10;The game board is divided into six separate triangles, which offer almost limitless possibilities for new terrain each game. Each player places his armies at the start of the game in his home battle sector. The board also contains terrain markers and vortex markers, which the armies can use to jump around and appear unexpectedly behind enemy lines, presenting a sudden and unforeseen threat to the rear.&#10;&#10;The terrain transforms what would otherwise be a featureless playing area into one that more closely resembles the terrain over which actual battles are fought. With an almost incalculably large number of possible different terrain configurations, strategy cannot be decided in advance. The beginner always stands a chance against the experienced player.&#10;&#10;Bin&acute;Fa armies use up supplies when they move just as real armies do. On taking possession of the dice, players must choose between moving their army units on the battle sector (which uses up supplies) or using their turn to move the supply marker in hope of obtaining fresh supplies.&#10;&#10;One of the most exciting aspects of Bin&acute;Fa is the &quot;cavalry charge.&quot; As long as a player has sufficient supplies and is lucky enough to avoid rolling a double, it is possible to send a force dashing across the board to attack enemy units and (hopefully) return.&#10;&#10;The game of Bin&acute;Fa brings together two strands whose origins go back to very ancient times. Sun Tzu was a famous Chinese general and student of warfare. Bin&acute;Fa is based on the precepts contained in his classic work on the subject, &quot;The Art of War,&quot; written 2,300 years ago. They provide the structural framework for the game.&#10;&#10;";1977;5.68317;2.0833;2;6;60;10;Abstract Strategy, Wargame;originally publish designer bin fa company taoist arts inc release year later hexagony avalon hill bin fa designer company kenterprise avalon hill slightly different alan moon credit development bin fa release february undergo numerous alteration change previous incarnation bin fa describe publisher designer bin rsquo fa strategy army unit general supply pawn multiple army army object capture oppose army unit surround remove divide separate triangle offer limitless possibility new terrain place army start home battle sector contain terrain marker vortex marker army use jump appear unexpectedly enemy line present sudden unforeseen threat rear terrain transform featureless playing area closely resemble terrain actual battle fight incalculably large number possible different terrain configuration strategy decide advance beginner stand chance experienced bin acute fa army use supply real army take possession dice choose army unit battle sector use supply supply marker hope obtain fresh supply exciting aspect bin acute fa cavalry charge long sufficient supply lucky avoid double possible send force dash attack enemy unit hopefully return bin acute fa bring strand origin ancient time sun tzu famous chinese general student warfare bin acute fa base precept contain classic work subject art war write year ago provide structural framework
1513;The Republic of Rome;"The Republic of Rome is an abstraction of over 250 years of history.  It simulates the politics of the Roman Senate during the republic.  The players take the part of various factions vying for the control of the senate.  They control the various powerful families of the time, who compete for state offices, military command, economic concessions and new adherents.  To win the player must get their faction to become the most powerful in Rome.  While doing this, however, a balance must be maintained.  A hostile world situation, and the vagaries of the public of Rome means that the players must also cooperate so that Rome herself doesn't go down under this pressure.  If Rome does not last, neither does the senate, and all players lose!&#10;&#10;Players make proposals to the Senate which other players then vote on. A player's ability to make proposals is determined by which Offices his/her Senators hold. A player's influence in votes is determined by the number of Senators they have recruited and the level of influence those Senators have obtained. Proposals may include assigning Senators to govern provinces (generating revenue), recruiting an army to fight an external foe, addressing the concerns of the Roman people, assigning offices or prosecuting previous office holders. Players have to co-operate to overcome the various threats that the game sends against Rome (wars, famine, unrest, bankruptcy) whilst working to build their own Senators' and Generals' positions and undermine that of their opponents. A powerful General or an influential Senator may become Emperor (thus winning the game) but equally may suddenly fall to the plague or an assassin's blade.&#10;&#10;";1990;7.5391;4.3686;1;6;300;14;Ancient, Negotiation, Political, Wargame;republic rome abstraction year history simulate politic roman senate republic faction vie senate powerful family time compete state office military command economic concession new adherent faction powerful rome balance maintain hostile world situation vagary public rome mean cooperate rome doesn t pressure rome senate proposal senate vote proposal determine office senator hold influence vote determine number senator recruit influence senator obtain proposal include assign senator govern province generate revenue recruit army fight external foe address concern roman people assign office prosecute previous office holder co operate overcome threat send rome war famine unrest bankruptcy whilst work build senator general position undermine opponent powerful general influential senator emperor equally suddenly fall plague assassin blade

1515;Upwords;"Players take turns forming words on either an 8x8 (original and Winning Moves &quot;new classic&quot; versions) or a 10x10 (most later versions) grid. Words may be formed horizontally or vertically, as in Scrabble, but, as the title suggests, the letters may also be stacked.  This allows already played words to change into different words by stacking new letters (up to a limit of 5 high). For example, LATE could be changed to CATER and then to BELATED. Instead of having different values for each letter, when a new word is formed, the number of tiles used in that word is counted.  If the whole word is one tile high (no stacking), then the word scores 2 points per tile.  However, if there are any stacked tiles, you score one point per tile in the word, including those underneath.  This results in scoring that increases as the game continues, even for simpler words.&#10;&#10;";1982;5.75158;1.6767;2;4;90;8;Word Game;form word x original new classic x later grid word form horizontally vertically scrabble title suggest letter allow word change different word new letter limit high example late change cater belate instead have different value letter new word form number tile word count word tile high stacking word tile tile tile word include underneath result increase continue simple word
1516;USAC Auto Racing;"Billed as the Official Game of the United States Auto Club this is one of Avalon Hill's early Sports Illustrated branded games. The game was created by Jim Barnes who sold the game at a booth that he set up at Indy and other race track promenades in the 1970s. Mr. Barnes struck a deal with Avalon Hill and the game was changed a little by the development team at AH and published with the SI logo on the box.  On an oval track you can run up to 33 cars. Each car has its own driver card derived from the performance of the actual drivers of the featured Indy race. Ongais, Foyt, Unser, Sneva, Mears, Rutherford etc, every driver that was in the that year's Indy has a card with a color photo on one side and game racing charts on the other side.  One Card set, for an even year Indy race from 1978 through 1986, was included in the box with the other card sets offered through the AH mail order program.&#10;&#10;Each driver card has 6 tables on the back. Three of the tables for movement, you chose whether you are going to drive normally, charge or back off and then roll 2 dice, referencing the appropriate table. The result will tell you how far you can move or if you have encountered car trouble. There are 2 trouble tables that can slow you down or knock you out of the race. There is also a pit stop table which controls how many turns you must sit in the pits before re-entering the race.&#10;&#10;The game is driven on Stats and can be played solitaire.&#10;&#10;";1979;6.06448;1.7241;2;33;120;10;Racing, Sports;bill official united states auto club avalon hill early sport illustrate brand create jim barnes sell booth set indy race track promenade mr barne strike deal avalon hill change little development team ah publish si logo box oval track run car car driver card derive performance actual driver indy race ongais foyt unser sneva mears rutherford etc driver year indy card color photo racing chart card set year indy race include box card set offer ah mail order program driver card table table choose go drive normally charge dice reference appropriate table result tell far encounter car trouble trouble table slow knock race pit stop table sit pit enter race drive stat solitaire

1520;Monad;"The object of the game is to collect round cards known as &quot;Monads,&quot; which look like yin-yang symbols. The players do this by Trading, Buying, and Leaping with other cards.&#10;&#10;Monad / Die 1. Million uses a deck of cards with six colors (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, and Purple). Half of these are called &quot;Warm&quot; colors (Red, Orange, and Yellow), and the others are &quot;Cool&quot; colors (Green, Blue, and Purple). The majority of cards has one symbol on them (known as &quot;Commons&quot;), but there is one card of each color with 2-5 colors on them (known as &quot;Bis,&quot; &quot;Tris,&quot; &quot;Quads,&quot; and &quot;Quints&quot;). At the start of the game, each player is assigned one of the six colors as their &quot;identity&quot; and is dealt six Commons and one &quot;Bonus&quot; card (which shows three pairs of colors). The Bis, Tris, Quads, and Quints are placed face up in separate piles in the center of the table.&#10;&#10;On their turn, a player attempts to get higher numbered cards into their hand. The easiest way is by &quot;Trading.&quot; To trade, a player turns in a pair of cards with the same number of symbols but of opposite colors (one warm and one cool) and takes the top card from the stack with the next highest number of symbols. When they turn in two Quints, they gain a Monad. If the two cards turned in match one of the pairs on their bonus card, they may also draw the top card from each of the lower stacks. They may also use cards of the same color as their Identity as wild cards, which are treated as having any number of symbols.&#10;&#10;The player can turn in more than two cards and &quot;Leap&quot; to a higher stack. This allows them to select a card with a higher number of symbols. Finally, they can &quot;Buy&quot; a card. Buying cards uses the numbers located on each card. The player turns in a number of cards which total greater than the number on the card they are after. Monads can be purchased for 80 points.&#10;&#10;A player can also draw the top card from the deck but doing so prevents them from taking any other action that turn.&#10;&#10;The first player to accumulate a given number of Monads (which varies depending on the number of players in the game) is the winner.&#10;&#10;Belongs to the 3M Gamette Series&#10;&#10;";1968;6.24664;2.0286;2;4;60;10;Card Game;object collect card know monad look like yin yang symbol trading buying leap card monad die million use deck card color red orange yellow green blue purple half call warm color red orange yellow cool color green blue purple majority card symbol know commons card color color know bis tris quad quint start assign color identity deal common bonus card show pair color bis tris quad quint place face separate pile center table attempt high numbered card hand easy way trading trade pair card number symbol opposite color warm cool take card high number symbol quint gain monad card match pair bonus card draw card low use card color identity wild card treat have number symbol card leap high allow select card high number symbol finally buy card buying card use number locate card number card total great number card monad purchase draw card deck prevent take action accumulate give number monad vary depend number winner belong m gamette series

1523;Pharao;"This is the third in the Pharao-Brettspiele series of games, the other two being Isis and Ramses.&#10;The board is an Ancient Egyptian Senet board, and the game can be played as such if one supplies the throwing sticks (randomizing devices that eventually evolved into dice; available in commercial Senet sets or easily home-made).  Note, however, that there are only 4 pieces per player instead of the almost-standard 5 (historically, the number of pieces per player varied between 5 and 10), so a fifth piece would ideally need to be supplied.&#10;H. A. Renz chose, once more, to use the components for an entirely different, modern abstract strategy game.  Each player uses two special dice to move both his pieces and his adversary's (this is the only game of the triad to have a random element).  The object of the game is to either &quot;push&quot; all adversary pieces into the water (a special square), occupy the &quot;happiness&quot; square with one's last remaining piece, or box the adversary in so he cannot move.&#10;Note how driving towards one victory condition (by adversary elimination) actually opens up a victory opportunity for the adversary --a neat twist.&#10;Remarkably, the starting position is asymmetric because the board is asymmetric.  There does not seem to be much of an advantage or handicap to being one side or the other.&#10;&#10;";1984;6.63158;1.5;2;2;30;7;Abstract Strategy, Ancient, Dice;pharao brettspiele series isis ramse ancient egyptian senet supply throw stick randomize device eventually evolve dice available commercial senet set easily home note piece instead standard historically number piece vary fifth piece ideally need supply h renz choose use component entirely different modern abstract strategy use special dice piece adversary triad random element object push adversary piece water special square occupy happiness square remain piece box adversary note drive condition adversary elimination actually open opportunity adversary neat twist remarkably starting position asymmetric asymmetric advantage handicap

1530;Dark Age: Feudal Lords;"Get a band of mercenaries together and go beat up someone else's band of mercenaries.&#10;&#10;You must first spend resource points to try and sway mercs to fight for you.  You then arm them to the teeth and give them skills.  Each character has a life value (how much damage it can take), a control value (used to recruit the person), a skill number (max amount of skills that can be played on the person), a weapon number (quantity of weapons that may be carried) and combat strings.&#10;&#10;The combat is quite involved and owes more to miniature gaming than to card games.  First you roll for ranged attacks and compare rolls to your DF string.  Each roll that meets or exceeds a number of the string hits so it possible to score multiple hits with one combatant.  The defender then gets to fire back in the same manner.  After DF is resolved you go to Close Combat.  Close combat is handled much the same way except you also have a blocking string so it is possible to block hits.&#10;&#10;Special mention must be made of the artwork on the cards.

1531;Ritter ohne Furcht und Tadel;"Depending upon the number of players, each player receives 1 or 2 knights.  Each of these knights lists a series of dice pips on the card, some of which are red in color.  These red numbers are the knights defensive abilities, and he will block these numbers if rolled by an opponent during a competition.  For instance, Upollonius Wolkenburg has a 1, 2 and 3 in red.  Thus, he will block one of each of these numbers each time dice are rolled by an opponent in a competition.  Some knights have less numbers in red, but they usually have a greater attack strength, meaning they can roll more dice in combat.  This mechanism borrows very heavily from many role playing and fantasy games.&#10;&#10;In addition to these 'defense' numbers and the attack dice chart, each knight card also has charts for prizes won (1 - 15) and damage points (1 - 10).  There are also nice illustrations on each card ... about the only kind thing I can say about the game.&#10;&#10;Each player also receives a 'lady' card.  Each lady possesses a number of characteristics, including hair color, build, height and personality.  When granting her favor to a knight (which is indicated by placing a corresponding token onto a knight card), the idea is to seek out a knight who desires similar characteristics in a lady.&#10;&#10;The start player challenges an opposing knight with one of his knights.  A challenge cannot be refused.  These two enter battle, which involves each player tossing a number of dice equal to their attack strength into the tournament field.  In mounted combat, any 1's, 2's or 3's thrown strike a blow, unless these are blocked by the opponent.  If any of these dice strike, the knight falls from his horse and the knight suffers hit points equal to the number of blows which were landed.  If only one knight is struck and falls from his horse, the opponent wins and earns a prize for himself and for his lady.  If both knights fall from their horse, then the match continues on foot.  This involves more dice rolling, but 4's, 5's and 6's now strike.  This continues until one knight concedes or reaches 10 damage points, at which time he is out of the tournament (and out of the game).&#10;&#10;The next player in turn order then challenges a knight.  This process is repeated until there is only one healthy knight remaining. The round then ends and victory points are doled out to the knight and lady who won the most prizes.  There are also potential bonuses which add to the players' scores.&#10;&#10;";1998;4.34;1.6154;2;10;45;12;Dice, Fighting, Medieval;depend number receive knight knight list series dice pip card red color red number knight defensive block number opponent competition instance upollonius wolkenburg red block number time dice opponent competition knight number red usually great attack strength mean dice combat mechanism borrow heavily role playing fantasy addition defense number attack dice chart knight card chart prize damage nice illustration card kind thing receive lady card lady possess number characteristic include hair color build height personality grant favor knight indicate place corresponding token knight card idea seek knight desire similar characteristic lady start challenge oppose knight knight challenge refuse enter battle involve toss number dice equal attack strength tournament field mount combat throw strike blow block opponent dice strike knight fall horse knight suffer hit equal number blow land knight strike fall horse opponent earn prize lady knight fall horse match continue foot involve dice rolling strike continue knight concede reach damage time tournament order challenge knight process repeat healthy knight remain end dole knight lady prize potential bonus add

1533;Ghost Chase;"One player takes the role of Max, the ghost.  Max hides himself in the Canterville castle.  The other players are the ghost chasers and search for Max in the castle.  Max and the ghost chasers begin the game in rooms of their choice.  The Max and his chasers move room to room.  Max moves invisibly, showing himself only from time to time.  The creatures living around the castle determine when Max must show himself.  After each game round, one animal is removed from the board.  When all animals of one type have been removed, Max must show which room he is in and how he got there.  Max has a code of honor and will not enter the same room twice during the chase.&#10;&#10;Unlike Max, the chasers may enter each room as often as they like.  They try to force Max into a dead end to catch him.  All the chasers win if one of the chasers enters the room where Max is.  If the last animal is removed from the board with Max having not been found, the player playing the role of Max is the winner!&#10;&#10;";2001;6.25675;1.6757;2;5;60;8;Children's Game, Deduction, Exploration;take role max ghost max hide canterville castle ghost chaser search max castle max ghost chaser begin room max chaser room room max invisibly show time time creature live castle determine max animal remove animal remove max room get max code honor enter room twice chase unlike max chaser enter room like try force max dead end catch chaser chaser enter room max animal remove max having find role max winner
1534;Jump!;"The premise is quite simple: jump out of airplanes and get your guys to land as close to the coast as possible. The closer you are to the coast, the more points you score. If you splash down into the water, however, you will score negative points. The further from the shore you are in the water, the more negative points you will suffer. &#10;The board depicts a section of land, followed by a beach and ocean. There is a lake on one space of the land section, and a one-space island in the ocean. The board also has two 'landing' tracks running parallel to each other. The tokens are placed on these tracks once they have leapt from the planes. Finally, the board also has a scoring track to tabulate the points ultimately scored following a round, as well as a cumulative scoring track which runs the perimeter of the board.&#10;&#10;Each player loads his or her tokens (which vary with the number of players) into the two airplanes. There are four rows of seats in the airplanes, and where your tokens are positioned will be important when considering the timing of your jumps. Players then each receive six cards plus one 'jump' card. These cards dictate the actions that will occur during the turn. Most of the cards move one of the planes (red or yellow) forward or backward a certain number of spaces. Other cards allow a player to switch seats in or between the planes, cancel any jump attempts that round or blow a jumper off course a space. Finally, the jump card causes one of the player's token to leap from the plane and land on the space directly below where he was seated.&#10;&#10;The mechanics are quite simple. Each player lays a card face down, and then all reveal their cards simultaneously. Beginning with the start player (which rotates each round), each player carries out the action his card depicts. However, if a player reveals a 'jump' card, then opponents who played a 'wind' or 'cancel jump' card must reveal them, taking the appropriate action. The 'wind' card can be disastrous, as that player gets to bump the jumper one space up or down. This may have the effect of landing the jumper in the water. Cards played are discarded, with the exception of the 'jump' card, which is retrieved back into the player's hand.&#10;&#10;When a token leaps from a plane (due to the play of a 'jump' card), he is placed on the outside track of the landing track. If another token leaps into the same space, it is placed along the inside track. Any other tokens that land on that same space are shoved back to the next empty space on the landing track. This can result in a scoring reduction if the token is being moved further from the coast, but can also be a positive occurrence if this causes the token to be moved onto the land as opposed to falling into the water.&#10;&#10;Play continues until all tokens have jumped from the planes. They are then moved one-by-one to the scoring track, beginning with the token furthest from the shore. There is a positive scoring track for those tokens that were fortunate enough to land on solid ground, and a negative scoring track for those jumpers who splashed into the water. The more tokens that successfully landed on the ground, the more points the players closest to the shore will score. The converse is also true!&#10;&#10;Once all tokens have been repositioned onto the scoring tracks, each player tallies his final results and these are marked on the cumulative scoring track. This entire process is then repeated two more times and the player with the most cumulative points following the third round is victorious.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.20879;1.7143;2;5;45;10;Aviation / Flight;premise simple jump airplane guy land close coast possible close coast splash water negative shore water negative suffer depict section land follow beach ocean lake space land section space island ocean landing track run parallel token place track leapt plane finally track tabulate ultimately follow cumulative track run perimeter load token vary number airplane row seat airplane token positioned important consider timing jump receive card plus jump card card dictate action occur card plane red yellow forward backward certain number space card allow switch seat plane cancel jump attempt blow jumper course space finally jump card cause token leap plane land space directly seat simple lay card face reveal card simultaneously begin start rotate carry action card depict reveal jump card opponent wind cancel jump card reveal take appropriate action wind card disastrous get bump jumper space effect land jumper water card discard exception jump card retrieve hand token leap plane jump card place outside track landing track token leap space place inside track token land space shove space landing track result reduction token coast positive occurrence cause token land oppose fall water continue token jump plane track begin token furthest shore positive track token fortunate land solid ground negative track jumper splash water token successfully land ground close shore converse true token reposition track tally final result mark cumulative track entire process repeat time cumulative follow victorious
1535;Formula 1;"A simple racing game where speed and movement is decided by the driver and not the dice. Only when exceeding safety speeds on the bends are dice used to decide the penalty incurred.&#10;&#10;The players use &quot;dashboards&quot;, cardboard cutouts resembling dashboards, complete with a speedometer and tire and brake wear gauges.  Maximum acceleration is fixed, tire and brake wear may happen as a result of cornering too quickly&mdash;then there are the dreaded spinouts.  A few tight spots exist, so blocking is also an effective tactic.&#10;Tactic cards (you get 5 for the entire race) put a few aces up your sleeve.  They can give you an extra burst of speed or of cornering ability.&#10;&#10;Pit stops will get you fresh brakes and tires but you must reach them by exact count&mdash;otherwise you're forced into another lap.  Also, pit cards throw a monkeywrench in&mdash;usually you'll lose a turn, but now and then you'll get extra fast service, a burst of speed in coming out of the pit, or special brakes good for one extra corner.&#10;&#10;The race runs for up to 10 laps; the player furthest past the finish line when all players have had the same number of turns wins.&#10;The game's simplicity makes it accessible to younger players, whilst it remains enjoyable by adults.&#10;&#10;";1962;6.69123;1.7049;2;6;120;10;Racing, Sports;simple racing speed decide driver dice exceed safety speed bend dice decide penalty incur use dashboard cardboard cutout resemble dashboard complete speedometer tire brake wear gauge maximum acceleration fix tire brake wear happen result corner quickly mdash dreaded spinout tight spot exist blocking effective tactic tactic card entire race ace sleeve extra burst speed corner pit stop fresh brake tire reach exact count mdash force lap pit card throw monkeywrench mdash usually ll ll extra fast service burst speed come pit special brake good extra corner race run laps furth past finish line number simplicity make accessible young whilst remain enjoyable adult

1540;BattleTech;"BattleTech (aka &quot;BT&quot;) is a science-fiction tactical wargame in which players battle one another with various war machines.  The heart of the game is the &quot;BattleMech&quot; (aka Mech), a giant fighting robot; typical games have each player controlling from 1-4 Mechs.  Vehicles, infantry, power armour, aircraft and other unit types also exist.  The game system includes details such as varying weapon ranges, heat generation, and discrete hit locations (torso, arms, legs, etc.). Mechs vary greatly by mobility and firepower, and players can choose from provided designs or take the time to create their own Mechs from scratch.  The game is typically played on one or more hex mapsheets or mounted map boards; optional rules are also available for hexless play.  An extensive line of pewter figurines (Mechs, vehicles, and the like) are available from Iron Wind Metals. (Many earlier BattleTech figures were produced and sold by Ral Partha, which still handles the figure line in Europe.)&#10;&#10;As in earlier editions of BattleTech, introductory box sets are available.  The current versions are the BattleTech: Beginner Box (contains 2 plastic Mechs, a map, and simplified quick-start Mech rules). Designed to immediately follow this is the BattleTech: A Game of Armored Combat box (8 plastic Mechs, mapsheets, cardboard Mech standees, and the full rules for Mechs and basic gear).  Lastly, the BattleTech: Clan Invasion box adds further Mechs and maps and slightly expands the rules to include more advanced technologies and unit types, while moving a player forward through the game's timeline.&#10;&#10;The main component of the current generation of BattleTech is a series of rulebooks.  The primary ones are either Total Warfare, which covers combined arms (Mechs, combat vehicles, battle armor, aircraft etc), or the BattleTech: BattleMech Manual, which continues on from the introductory box sets in offering more advanced but still Mech-only play.  The rest of the current in-print rulebook line is covered below.&#10;&#10;BT is also supplemented by a variety of Technical Readouts, which provide gameplay and background data on Mechs and other units at various time periods in the game-universe history.  Accompanying these are pregenerated PDF record sheet collections, which have full gameplay statistics for each unit in a corresponding Technical Readout and are designed to be printed out for tabletop play.  Also common are map sets, which add additional mapsheets for scenario variety; era-based sourcebooks detailing the history and factions of the setting; and the aforementioned miniatures (which are not required for play).&#10;&#10;For about six years the game was known as &quot;Classic BattleTech&quot;, to differentiate it from the WizKids-produced collectible miniatures game &quot;MechWarrior: Dark Age&quot;.  This branding has been long since abandoned and no longer appears on any products, but many BGG entries still feature it even if not applicable.&#10;&#10;Rulebooks&#10;&#10;     Total Warfare (standard game rules for the most common unit types)&#10;

1544;Beyond Balderdash;"Beyond Balderdash is the expanded second edition of Balderdash.  Balderdash is based on bluffing your opponents into guessing your false definitions to obscure words.  Beyond Balderdash adds several new categories to the mix:  Movies (make up a plot), Dates (say what happened on it), People (say what the person did), and Initials (make up what they stand for).  The real answers are often even more outrageous than the bluffs, so the game offers plenty of laughs.&#10;&#10;The UK version of Absolute Balderdash is a different variation with different questions.  Notably, the UK Absolute Balderdash features a &quot;Law&quot; category, where you complete the law given on the card. Beyond Balderdash is lacking that category, and features in its place a &quot;Date&quot; category, where you are given a date and must come up with the historical significance.  The Canadian and Australian versions of Absolute Balderdash also feature the Date category instead of Law.&#10;&#10;Absolute and Beyond were merged into the game Balderdash at least by 2003 (there is a 1997 edition of Beyond Balderdash still with the Dates category).  Now, the vanilla version of Balderdash is the five-category edition with Laws instead of Dates.  Balderdash with a single category (word definitions) has not existed since at least 2003.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Kokkelimonke Jubileum&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Balderdash&#10;&#10;&#10;";1993;6.82787;1.4714;2;6;45;10;Bluffing, Party Game, Trivia, Word Game;balderdash expand second balderdash balderdash base bluff opponent guess false definition obscure word balderdash add new category mix movie plot date happen people person initial stand real answer outrageous bluff offer plenty laugh uk absolute balderdash different variation different question notably uk absolute balderdash law category complete law give card balderdash lack category place date category give date come historical significance canadian australian absolute balderdash date category instead law absolute merge balderdash balderdash date category vanilla balderdash category law instead date balderdash single category word definition exist implement kokkelimonke jubileum implement balderdash

1548;Libero;"Abstract Soccer Game played on a grid of squares. Each player has eleven wooden tokens - nine basic ones, one libero (sweeper) and one goalkeeper. Each piece has a small dent on top so the ball can be placed on it. &#10;In a turn, the active player can pass the ball as many times as s/he wishes, in a straight unblocked line (diagonal, too), and move one piece. Regular pieces move any distance diagonally, while the libero can move orthogonally as well (same as the goalie, who is restricted to the box, though). A piece that reaches a field adjacent to an opponent piece with the ball can grab the ball. Goals can be scored if a piece that is not offside can play the ball into the goal in a straight line.&#10;&#10;One half time is played until a player has scored three goals. After two half times, the player with most goals is the winner (in case of a tie, an extension is played).&#10;&#10;";1984;6.75;0.0;2;2;45;10;Abstract Strategy, Sports;abstract soccer grid square wooden token basic one libero sweeper goalkeeper piece small dent ball place active pass ball time wish straight unblocked line diagonal piece regular piece distance diagonally libero orthogonally goalie restrict box piece reach field adjacent opponent piece ball grab ball piece offside ball straight line half time half time winner case tie extension

Players control their own Hero in their portion of the maze as well as monsters in their opponents portion.  Each Hero is composed of several categories: Intelligence, Physical Appearance, Class, Strength, Luck, Hits, and Weapons Proficiency.  Each of these must be determined by the player from a fixed number of points.  To make a Hero super-strong will mean that some other category must suffer (super-strong and a lackwit?).  Monsters include such loathesome creatures as trolls, ogres, zombies, goblins, lycanthropes, men, and the horribly alluring succubus.  Each has an offensive potential as well as a defensive capability based on the type of creature vs. the Hero's weapon and how mightily he wields it.  Your Hero must avoid traps, slaughter monsters, gather gold, and make it to the end of the labyrinth to win the hand of the stunning, voluptuous daughter of the most powerful wizard in the land.

1574;Tactics II;"The hobby of wargaming was born in the 1950s with the publication of the game Tactics. TACTICS II is a direct descendant of this original board wargame.&#10;&#10;TACTICS II is sort of like military chess. Different pieces, called &quot;units&quot; in wargames, have different capabilities just like chess pieces. The major difference is that a player can move all his pieces each turn, and after all his pieces are moved, battles are resolved against the enemy units his pieces are next to (adjacent to).&#10;&#10;The other major difference between wargames and chess is that wargames have a mapboard, divided into squares or hexagons for movement purposes. TACTICS II has a 22&quot; x 28&quot; mapboard portraying a fictional continent with two countries, Blue and Red. Terrain includes roads, rivers, woods, mountains, beaches, and cities. The Blue Capital can only be reached over a vast plain, bordered on the left by mountains and on the right by woods. The Red Capital is on an island and can only be reached across one of several bridges or by an amphibious invasion.&#10;&#10;Game features include special functions for headquarters units, terrain effects, invasions, airborne assaults, weather effects, replacements, isolation, and even nuclear weapons. Units represent infantry (25 per side), armor (6), mountain (2), airborne (2), headquarters (1+2+4), and amphibious troops (2) and 6 counters without symbol (You can use as replacement for headquarters having fired their nuclear missile; the 3 types of headquarter have different nuclear missiles). 100 counters in all.&#10;&#10;TACTICS II was almost always part of the Avalon Hill game line, primarily because it was sold as an introductory wargame for a number of reasons. The rules introduced many basic board wargaming concepts and were relatively low in complexity. The rulebook is divided into a basic game and a tournament game (advanced game). Both are balanced and relatively quick playing. As the opposing armies are identical in size and composition, victory is gained by a combination of logic, foresight, luck, common sense, and skill in military strategy and tactics.&#10;&#10;In 1981, an unauthorized hex map version, called Opera&#195;&#167;&#195;&#163;o MX-1, was released in Brazil.

1578;RoadKill;"Description text from the back of the game-box:&#10;&#10;Cross-Country Demolition Racing in the 21st Century (or &quot;Armored Leapfrog&quot; as its adherents refer to it) brings visions of Mad Max in all his infinite glory to your tabletop in an easily played card game format. Each player competes in an armored racer equipped with an assortment of &quot;accessories&quot; not commonly found in your average Auto Parts store. Road hog won't let you pass? No problem&hellip; debate the right of way with a burst of your front machine-guns. Annoyed by that tailgater? &hellip;a few well-timed grenades should scrape him off your bumper. Reckless passer? &hellip;well, if your smoke screen doesn&rsquo;t discourage him, a nudge from your scythe-blade hubcaps should do the job. And these are just the &quot;standard&quot; accessories. In the Advanced Game, you can customize your car into something even James Bond would envy.&#10;&#10;Running low on fuel &hellip; better pull into the next Rest Stop, but beware of sabotage or theft. Only losers nap during RoadKill. Besides, what better time to salt the track with tire spikes or change a road sign or two. Everything goes in Roadkill, an uproarious game of highway combat more vicious than the Santa Monica Freeway.&#10;&#10;Players vie for the lead so they may lay the next section of the course. For example, a player with a Nuclear Fuel Cell will want to lead the others on a merry chase through mountainous terrain to sap their fuel. However, someone already running on fumes will opt for a desert straight-away to finish the race before he must pit and relinquish the lead. But pole position has its price-attracting more than its share of misfortune, while slipstreaming provides opportunities back in the pack.&#10;&#10;As if the players don't heap enough mayhem upon each other, the game throws an endless series of monkey wrenches into play as cars breakdown, the road widens and narrows or comes to a temporary stop in a blizzard, rock slide, or drawbridge (or does it?).

1580;Legends of Robin Hood;"What red-blooded lad hasn't imagined himself fighting at the side of Robin Hood against the evil Prince John and the Sheriff of Nottingham? Cops and robbers, cowboys and Indians, Robin Hood and his Merry Men are all part of a young man's rite of passage from childhood flights of fancy. Long the stuff of screen legend, Robin Hood now lives again in a game format for the entire family.&#10;&#10;So come with us back to the greenwood in twelfth century England as our heroes Robin, Little john, Friar Tuck, Will Scarlet and Allan A&rsquo; Dale scour the countryside with quarter staff and long bow rob the rich and save the poor from the oppressions of nobles and clergy. Each player assumes the role of an outlaw clad in Lincoln green and tries to outdo his fellows in amassing the most gold by winning archery contests, recruiting stout yeomen, or robbing wealthy travelers. But beware; the woods are full of the Sheriff's men. Ambushes by Prince John or Sir Guy of Guisbourne could land you in irons in a castle dungeon.&#10;&#10;Play is extremely simple as each player maneuvers his band across the map using playing cards that both dictate the action and define the sequence of play with little or no reference to the rules.

This retains the system wide standard ground movement allowances and movement point costs. Air unit ranges have been doubled (to reflect raw range) as they are not affected by the time scale change. Land units represent Brigades, Regiments, Battalions, Companies &amp; KamfGruppes.&#10;&#10;The game includes a few shorter scenarios plus several different start-dates for the campaign games, based on the various critical events of the campaign. &#10;Playing time can be a couple of hours for the shorter scenarios, but as with all the OCS games the real money is in the various campaigns, which - while quite manageable on the scale of these things - still can take from one to two full weekends to play to completion.&#10;&#10;This is certainly the most rules-intensive of all the OCS games with air, ground, and naval units (including aircraft carriers!), airdrop capability on both sides, and the invasion and naval supply transport rules.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1/4 week&#10;Hex: 2.5 miles / 4 Km&#10;Units: Company to Corps&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;Two 22 x 34&quot; full-color maps&#10;Five dual-side printed countersheets (1,540 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 40-page OCS v2.0i system rules booklet&#10;One 36-page Sicily specific rules booklet&#10;Two OCS Charts &amp; Tables booklets&#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;";2000;7.75517;4.0;2;2;60;16;Wargame, World War II;sicily triumph folly campaign capture sicily th gamer popular ocs operational combat series cover operation husky invasion fall messina break ground series use mile hex scale instead usual mile hex scale cover major amphibious operation represent week instead week retain wide standard ground allowance cost air unit range double reflect raw range affect time scale change land unit represent brigade regiment battalion company amp kamfgruppe include short plus different start date campaign base critical event campaign playing time couple hour short ocs real money campaign manageable scale thing weekend completion certainly intensive ocs air ground naval unit include aircraft carrier airdrop capability side invasion naval supply transport scale week hex mile km unit company corp inventory x color map dual print countersheet page oc v booklet page sicily specific booklet oc chart amp table booklet sided dice
1586;The Hobbit Adventure Boardgame;"Each player is a hobbit who is attempting to gather the experience, equipment, and information that will enable him to defeat (outwit) the Dragon at Carn D&ucirc;m.  A player wins when he defeats the Dragon.&#10;&#10;Released almost simultaneously by Queen in Europe and ICE in North America.  The game looks good but is maybe a little too light&mdash;strategy is rather minimal as you simply run around trying to get stuff.

1588;Bauernschlau;"The theme of this game is building sheep farms. Each farmer (player) owns a farm consisting of hexes radiating out from the center of the board, and whose boundaries (and therefore, sizes) are initially undefined. The placement of fences -- each of which is shared by the two surrounding farms -- defines the boundaries. Some hexes are clearly going to be in certain farms; others will be fought over (either to acquire or avoid!) fiercely.&#10;&#10;The goal is to complete one's own farm by having the fences on both its sides reach the outer edge of the board before the game ends (without which one cannot win), and to have the most enclosed points among all such completed farms (which wins).&#10;&#10;The sheep are on thick cardboard disks, printed on one side with values ranging from 5 (the best) down to -3. One sheep can fit onto each board hex.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player gets to do one of several actions:&#10;&#10;1) place a sheep blindly from the supply face-down onto an empty board space after secretly looking at it; 2) turn up a face-down sheep tile in place (thereby freezing it for the rest of the game); 3) use the cool wooden sheepdog to blindly &quot;herd&quot; a face-down sheep from one hex to another, where it is then flipped up and frozen; or 4) lay a fence piece on either of the two fences surrounding his farm.&#10;&#10;Certain board hexes, symmetrically distributed, act as multipliers for the sheep that ends up in that space.  There are a few special situation rules and a few rules governing fence placement. There are strong elements of bluff and memory in this game.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player's completed farm is filled with pieces (either face-up or down sheep, or the dog). Whoever has the highest number of points on face-up sheep in his/her farm after applying multipliers is the winner.&#10;&#10;";1991;6.0735;1.6;2;6;45;8;Farming, Memory;build sheep farm farmer own farm consist hex radiate center boundary size initially undefined fence share surround farm define boundary hex clearly go certain farm fight acquire avoid fiercely complete farm have fence side reach outer edge end enclose complete farm sheep thick cardboard disk print value range good sheep fit hex get action place sheep blindly supply face space secretly look face sheep tile place freeze rest use cool wooden sheepdog blindly herd face sheep hex frozen lie fence piece fence surround farm certain hex symmetrically distribute act multiplier sheep end space special situation govern fence strong element bluff memory end complete farm fill piece face sheep dog high number face sheep farm apply multiplier winner

The first player then takes the dice and rolls and continues to roll until he rolls a 7. Each rolled number is kept track of unless a 7 or doubles is rolled.&#10;&#10;If a double is rolled the player who has the double marked adds it to his score and must ante a chip into the jackpot. On a seven the total that the player has rolled is added to his score and a new round is started. If a 7 is rolled by way of a 6 and a 1 the player forfeits his entire score and must ante 1 chip. The first player to achieve a score of 252 or better while it is his turn to roll wins the game and collects the jackpot.&#10;&#10;The rules do not assign any significance to the jackpot so I can only think that it is supposed to be a betting game.

1602;The Royal Game of Ur;"The game has been published under different names but it is a simple race game very much like Backgammon. This edition has a board that is a reproduction of the original found in the Mesopotamian city of Ur. Each player brings their 7 pieces in to play and takes them off of their outer track. Opposing pieces come into conflict on the inner track that they must travel on to the exit. If you land on a space occupied by a single opponent's piece you send it back to the start. If you land on a space occupied by 2 or more opponent's pieces then your piece goes back to the start.&#10;&#10;The four dice give a marked or blank result. They are tetrahedral (four-sided) dice.&#10;&#10;Each die gives a &quot;1&quot; or a &quot;0&quot;. You can roll 0,1,2,3, or 4. Statistically, 2 is most common- a good thing to bear in mind. The rosette in the central track is a &quot;safe&quot; place from which you cannot be bumped, but you can be bumped on others. Landing on any rosette allows you to roll again, but you don't need to move that same piece.&#10;&#10;All moves must be made by one piece only.&#10;&#10;First to bear off all 7 of his pieces wins.&#10;&#10;Note - Rules update in line with guidance from Irving Finkel from British Museum.&#10;&#10;The game may be a relative of Senet and Aseb.&#10;&#10;";-2600;6.2233;1.2453;2;2;30;10;Abstract Strategy, Dice;publish different name simple race like backgammon reproduction original found mesopotamian city ur bring piece take outer track oppose piece come conflict inner track travel exit land space occupy single opponent piece send start land space occupy opponent piece piece go start dice marked blank result tetrahedral sided dice die give statistically common good thing bear mind rosette central track safe place bump bump land rosette allow don t need piece piece bear piece note update line guidance irving finkel british museum relative senet aseb

1610;The Worlds of Boris Vallejo;"From the 30 world tiles (each featuring a different painting by Vallejo) each player, 1 at a time, chooses one and places it so that it touches at least 1 other tile. This is done until each player has placed 5 tiles. This makes up the playing board.&#10;&#10;Each player then receives 8 cards from the card deck. Cards come in 4 flavors. World cards, which are not shuffled into the deck, have info about each world tile. The player who owns that tile takes the card for reference. Character cards have a base strength, class and a home world indicator. They can be played to a tile that you own as defense against attack. If they are played to their home world their strength is doubled. Scroll cards can be placed on worlds and used by characters that can wield magic. These cards boost the base strength. Artifact cards can be used by any character. They boost strength and sometimes have special powers.&#10;&#10;Each player picks a world tile to be his home and places 5 of their 8 cards there to defend it. Players also have a pawn that represents their army.&#10;&#10;During a turn a player first draws 3 cards from the deck.&#10;&#10;Second a player may play up to 2 cards. These cards can be played from his hand to a controlled world, from a controlled world to another controlled world or from a controlled world to his hand.&#10;&#10;Third a player may move his pawn 1 or 2 worlds. If he enters a world controlled by another player he must stop.&#10;&#10;Although not stated in the rules I would assume if a pawn is in a world not claimed by another player he could claim the world and play cards there. If a pawn is in a world occupied by another player you would then have a battle. A battle is fought between the cards on the tile as defense and the cards from the attacking players hand.

1628;Elric;"Based on Michael Moorcock's Elric series, this wargame attempts to bring the various nuances of the novels together. War, politics, magic, and the balance between Chaos and Law are all simulated.&#10;&#10;While armies, as in most wargames, are essential, individual characters also play a vital role. Magic is also important as spell casting affects the cosmic balance between Chaos and Law.&#10;&#10;There are 6 scenarios provided for 1 to 4 players plus an encouragement to create your own.&#10;&#10;All in all a very faithful rendition of the books.&#10;&#10;";1977;5.80732;2.4737;1;4;120;10;Adventure, Fantasy, Novel-based, Wargame;base michael moorcock elric series wargame attempt bring nuance novel war politic magic balance chaos law simulate army wargame essential individual character vital role magic important spell casting affect cosmic balance chaos law provide plus encouragement create faithful rendition book

1632;Shapeshifters;"Two wizards bent on killing each other have the ability take on the forms of a wide variety of different animals, some real, some mythic.&#10;&#10;Using replaceable spell points, the wizards change forms to get an upper hand on each other.  There is a cost for transforming and maintaining a form so it is not always best to transform to a large, dangerous animal.  Animals are rated for movement, movement type (flying, ground, diving), size, attack, defense, reflexes and special ability.  There is a flow chart showing cost of changing from one form to another.

1634;Warhammer Quest;"Warhammer Quest is the original game in the Warhammer Quest Series.&#10;&#10;From the Main Rulebook:&#10;&#10;In Warhammer Quest each player takes the role of a warrior, one of four brave adventurers willing to test their courage in the search for wealth and glory. Each hero comes from a different people. The Barbarian has traveled far from the savage north, a land of bitter cold and ferocious warriors. The Wizard hails from the cities of the Empire, the largest and most important of the realms of men. The Dwarf is drawn by the goldlust for which his race is famous. Dwarfs are grim and rather abrupt, but they are good fighters and loyal friends who remember debts of gratitude as readily as debts of coin. The Elf comes from the green woods of Loren where his kin spend their days hunting and making merry, protected from evil by the strange magic of their land. Elves are incredibly quick and agile, and they are also the best archers in the world.&#10;&#10;In the Warhammer Quest game the players enter a dark and forbidding dungeon. Together they must face the horrific dangers that wait for them. They will be attacked by monsters such as Orcs, Goblins, Skaven and Minotaurs. Other perils lurk in the darkness: scurrying venomous things like spiders, deadly pit traps, and decayed tunnels that cave in at the slightest touch. If they complete their quest the players will be rewarded with gold, treasure and artefacts of magical power. The more gold and treasure you can discover the better.., and the player whose warrior amasses the greatest fortune has done best of all!&#10;&#10;Warhammer Quest is probably unlike other games you have played. Rather than each player competing against the others, all the players must co-operate if they are to win. Also, there is no single board. Instead, the different rooms and corridor sections are clipped together to make a dungeon that is different every time you play. The game rules may seem a little complex at first - but don't worry a lot of the rules are designed to extend the game and are not vital to begin with. The actual game rules you need to play are in this book or printed on the various cards. The hugely thick Role-play Book is all extra and alternative material that introduces you to a whole new hobby of role-playing Warhammer Quest.&#10;&#10;- Warhammer Quest Contents -&#10;&#10;    4 Warrior models: Barbarian, Dwarf, Elf and Wizard&#10;    6 Orc Warrior models&#10;    6 Orc Archer models&#10;    6 Goblin Spearmen models&#10;    6 Night Goblin Archer models&#10;    12 Skaven models&#10;    3 Minotaur models&#10;    12 Giant Spider models&#10;    12 Giant Bat models&#10;    12 Giant Rat models&#10;    12 Snotling models&#10;    10 Dungeon Doorways&#10;    32 Page Rule Book&#10;    16 Page Adventure Book&#10;    192 Page Role-play Book&#10;    1 How to Play sheet&#10;    50 Page Adventure Record Pad&#10;    19 Event Cards&#10;    23 Dungeon Cards&#10;    30 Treasure Cards&#10;    17 Blank Event Cards&#10;    15 Spell Cards&#10;    4 Warrior Cards&#10;    4 Battle-level Cards&#10;    4 Equipment Cards&#10;    4 Warrior Counters&#10;    6 Dungeon Rooms&#10;    5 Objective Rooms&#10;    7 Corridors&#10;    1 Steps&#10;    3 T-junctions&#10;    1 Corner&#10;    1 Portcullis Marker&#10;    1 Cave-in Marker&#10;    3 Pit of Despair Markers&#10;    6 Webbed Counters&#10;    15 Power Tokens&#10;    10 Luck Counters&#10;    24 plastic shields&#10;    18 Scenery Markers&#10;    6 Large Dice &amp; 12 Small Dice&#10;&#10;&#10;";1995;7.50746;2.6901;1;4;120;12;Adventure, Exploration, Fantasy, Fighting, Miniatures;warhammer quest original warhammer quest series main rulebook warhammer quest take role warrior brave adventurer willing test courage search wealth glory hero come different people barbarian travel far savage north land bitter cold ferocious warrior wizard hail city empire large important realm man dwarf draw goldlust race famous dwarf grim abrupt good fighter loyal friend remember debt gratitude readily debt coin elf come green wood loren kin spend day hunt make merry protect evil strange magic land elf incredibly quick agile good archer world warhammer quest enter dark forbid dungeon face horrific danger wait attack monster orc goblin skaven minotaur peril lurk darkness scurry venomous thing like spider deadly pit trap decay tunnel cave slight touch complete quest reward gold treasure artefact magical power gold treasure discover well warrior amass great fortune good warhammer quest probably unlike compete co operate single instead different room corridor section clip dungeon different time little complex don t worry lot extend vital begin actual need book print card hugely thick role book extra alternative material introduce new hobby role warhammer quest warhammer quest content warrior model barbarian dwarf elf wizard orc warrior model orc archer model goblin spearman model night goblin archer model skaven model minotaur model giant spider model giant bat model giant rat model snotle model dungeon doorways page book page adventure book page role book sheet page adventure record pad event card dungeon card treasure card blank event card spell card warrior card battle card equipment card warrior dungeon room room corridor step t junction corner portculli marker cave marker pit despair marker webbed power tokens luck plastic shield scenery marker large dice amp small dice
1636;The Quest of the Philosopher's Stone;"A unique game that combines strategy with puzzle solving.  Players or teams move their pawn around the board trying to gain two wisdom cards for each of the four territories.  Wisdom cards are earned by correctly answering brain teaser questions from the Book of Challenges.  Wisdom cards, in turn, allow a player to obtain an alphabetical clue for that territory.  The four alphabetical clues, correctly unscrambled, form a word related to the medieval theme of the game.  The first player to correctly decipher the word wins the game.  The board also contains areas to help the players move around the board and/or interfere with the progress of their opponents.&#10;&#10;";1986;5.47778;2.3333;2;8;120;8;Deduction, Fantasy, Medieval, Puzzle;unique combine strategy puzzle solve team pawn try gain wisdom card territory wisdom card earn correctly answer brain teaser question book challenge wisdom card allow obtain alphabetical clue territory alphabetical clue correctly unscrambled form word relate medieval correctly decipher word contain area help interfere progress opponent
1638;Archimedes;"A completely different game from the &quot;Archimedes&quot; published in 1995 by egSpiele. The game is played on an 8x8 board, with each player controlling one King pawn. On your turn, you must move your King (as a normal chess king) and then place a pyramid on the board. Once your King has become completely surrounded by pyramids and cannot move, you are out of the game, unless there are two pyramids of the same color (there are eight pyramids in five different colors) leading out in a straight line from your King, in which case you can move the one closest to your King to anywhere else on the board, and then move your King into the empty space.&#10;&#10;Oddly, the box this game came in is completely devoid of any extraneous info (including game designer and year of publication), and even the manufacturer's initials are in tiny print with a &copy; symbol, crammed down in the corner of the cover.

1650;The Lord of the Rings Adventure Game;"Milton Bradley marketed this game as a tie-in with Ralph Bakshi's &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; animated feature film. However, aside from the artwork and the piece names, the game only bears a superficial resemblance to either the movie or Tolkien's works.&#10;&#10;Each player chooses a character from the Fellowship. The object of the game is to have that character cast a magic Ring into Mount Doom. Along the way from the Shire to their final destination, players have opportunities to pick up *several* Rings. These rings may be spent to get past opposing creatures. However, to win the game, a player must have at least one Ring when they reach Mount Doom.&#10;&#10;Cards allow a player to move 1-3 clear spaces ahead, to defeat Orcs or Nazgul, to bypass the various opposing creatures on the board, or to traverse mountain terrain, dictate movement. Cards are also useful for stealing rings from an opponent, relocating Nazgul on the board, and other functions. Each player has a hand of 5 cards with which to play the game.&#10;&#10;Die rolling comes into play for fighting Orcs, Nazgul, Shelob and Gollum when you don't have a card to defeat (or escape from) them, or to traverse the mountains. A special die tells players how many turns they will be bogged down in a mountain space once they enter it.&#10;&#10;Card and Ring management afford strategy opportunities, while the rules remain simple enough (and the game quick enough) to allow the game to be played by a wide variety of ages. Despite its divergence from the main story, the game itself offers a measure of challenge that makes it enjoyable - far more so than it would have been as a simple &quot;roll-and-move&quot; game with a strict adherence to the movie or book theme.&#10;&#10;";1978;6.14805;1.9;2;4;45;10;Adventure, Fantasy, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Novel-based;milton bradley market tie ralph bakshi lord ring animate film aside artwork piece name bear superficial resemblance movie tolkien work choose character fellowship object character cast magic ring mount doom way shire final destination opportunity pick ring ring spend past oppose creature ring reach mount doom card allow clear space ahead defeat orc nazgul bypass oppose creature traverse mountain terrain dictate card useful steal ring opponent relocate nazgul function hand card die rolling come fight orc nazgul shelob gollum don t card defeat escape traverse mountain special die tell bogge mountain space enter card ring management afford strategy opportunity remain simple quick allow wide variety age despite divergence main story offer measure challenge make enjoyable far simple strict adherence movie book

1656;Smokers Wild;"In this anti-smoking game, the players try to accumulate money while avoiding addiction to cigarettes.  At the start of the game, each player picks a profession likely to benefit from the smoking of others (Doctor, Undertaker, etc.) and then starts moving around the board.  If a player lands on an advertising space, there's a chance that he or she will begin smoking.  When a smoker ends up sharing a space with another player, there's a chance he'll pawn one of his brand habits to him.  The more a player smokes, the faster they advance on the Life-O-Metre, which ends with death.  The game ends once the first player dies (in the short game) or when only one player remains alive (in the longer game).&#10;&#10;The game is extremely simple to play and is filled with all kinds of horrible (but sometimes amusing) puns.  The game's claim that it has the power to cause smokers to quit and to discourage people from ever picking up the habit is rather questionable, but since it's easy enough to be played by young children, its anti-smoking message might actually be able to reach an audience that hasn't heard it all before.  Unfortunately, the game's simplicity may well work against it; for some players, once all the jokes have been heard (and there aren't all that many), there's really not much reason left to play the game.  On the plus side, there's a lot of player interaction as your profession gets called upon or when you pass your cigarettes to another.&#10;&#10;Smokers Wild seems related to Drinkers Wild so it may have been originally published by Gamma Two.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    Drinkers Wild&#10;    Lovers Wild&#10;&#10;&#10;";1978;4.99881;1.1818;2;6;120;8;Humor;anti smoking try accumulate money avoid addiction cigarette start pick profession likely benefit smoking doctor undertaker etc start land advertising space chance begin smoke smoker end share space chance ll pawn brand habit smoke fast advance life o metre end death end die short remain alive long extremely simple fill kind horrible amusing pun claim power cause smoker quit discourage people pick habit questionable easy young child anti smoking message actually able reach audience hasn t hear unfortunately simplicity work joke hear aren t reason leave plus lot profession get call pass cigarette smoker wild relate drinker wild originally publish gamma similar drinker wild lover wild
1658;Police State;"&quot;A game of strategy, survival, power and wealth&quot;&#10;&#10;This is a sort of &quot;communist Monopoly&quot;.  The players go around the board, but which leg of the board they're allowed on depends on how far they've risen in the hierarchy yet.  The most visible status symbol is your apartment size --and the competition for the one and only full-size Dacha can be ferocious.  There are a number of other status perks, such as use of the State Car.  All in all, a very amusing game that actually does capture a fair amount of the flavour of life in the communist USSR before its fall.&#10;&#10;The game was invented by Harley Sachs in 1969 under the name POLICE STATE, and sold in England and the USA, even as far as Ireland and South America.  It was copyrighted, patented, and published by the IDEA DEVELOPMENT COMPANY (IDEVCO), licensed by Gameophiles and later by the L.A. Producers' Partnership under the name COMRADES.&#10;&#10;It got his second name COMRADES from a BBC documentary series (1983-84), which aired in 1986 in the US. The documentary was about the life of ordinary Soviet citizens, which got interviewed by the producer Richard Denton.&#10;&#10;";1976;5.3;1.0;2;8;120;10;Humor, Political;strategy survival power wealth sort communist monopoly leg allow depend far ve rise hierarchy visible status symbol apartment size competition size dacha ferocious number status perk use state car amusing actually capture fair flavour life communist ussr fall invent harley sach police state sell england usa far ireland south america copyright patent publish idea development company idevco license gameophile later l producer partnership comrade get second comrade bbc documentary series air documentary life ordinary soviet citizen get interview producer richard denton

There are 32 claims in all.&#10;In the first phase of play, each player stakes one claim (including claims already staked by that player or another one), until all claims have at least one stake on them.  After that, each player collects money based on any one claim he owns, and uses that money to reinforce his existing claim(s) or to jump another player's claim.  This process continues until one player has forced all other off the board.&#10;&#10;";1977;3.98444;2.0;2;4;60;10;American West, Economic, Negotiation;exciting land grab claim jumping old west pit land baron object land industry old west map divide claim state part state group industry timber gold oil farming cattle railroad spur claim stake claim include claim stake claim stake collect money base claim own use money reinforce exist claim jump claim process continue force
1662;NapolÃ©on: The Waterloo Campaign, 1815;"On June 18, 1815, one of the most decisive battles in military history was fought in Belgian fields twenty miles southeast of Brussels. Within a short 100 days, Napoleon, former emperor of France, had returned from exile on the island of Elba, again seized power, quickly assembled an army, and marched to defeat the dispersed British and Prussian armies now preparing to invade France.&#10;&#10;Napoleon invaded Belgium on June 15th, defeated the Prussians at the Battle of Ligny on the 16th and after a day of pursuit, faced the British and Dutch army commanded by Wellington. Aided by superb defensive tactics and the timely arrival of Prussian reinforcements, Wellington defeated the French in the great Battle of Waterloo, ending forever the military ambitions of the great Napoleon.&#10;&#10;Highlights:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Mapboard which is a color map of southern Belgium. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Wooden Blocks as counters provide step-reduction and fog of war with no muss or fuss &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Two or three player game - Napoleon can be played by two or three players.

The game can end when a player achieves a specific point total, or when all opposing fleets are sunk.&#10;The game is of medium complexity. There are one additional expansion set, Modern Naval Battles III, available. The one major issue with the game is the lack of weapon cards (torpedoes) available for the submarines. This expansion set focuses on campaign play and adds new ships and action cards.&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;    Modern Naval Battles&#10;&#10;&#10;Other Expansions:&#10;&#10;    Modern Naval Battles III&#10;&#10;&#10;";1990;6.8026;2.25;2;6;90;12;Card Game, Expansion for Base-game, Modern Warfare, Nautical, Wargame;modern naval battle ii set modern naval battle card base present day sea power take maneuver ship fleet attack opponent ship defend fleet enemy attack fleet compose randomly select ship frigate destroyer battleship carrier etc boat submarine varied attack defense capability end receive enemy vessel sink end achieve specific total oppose fleet sink medium complexity additional set modern naval battle iii available major issue lack weapon card torpedo available submarine set focus campaign add new ship action card expand modern naval battle modern naval battle iii
1672;Open Fire: Solitaire Tank Combat in WWII;"&quot;Open Fire: Solitaire Tank Combat in WWII&quot; is the solitaire wargame of combat, adventure, and heroism for everyone who ever wondered what World War II armored combat must have been like. Inspired by the award-winning Ambush! solitaire wargame system, Open Fire provides the player with a platoon of American armor, faced with a variety of missions against an ever-changing German foe. The variable events, innumerable tactical options, and wealth of unexpected occurrences make &quot;Open Fire&quot; a game unlike any tactical armor game you have ever played before. The easily learned rules are designed to get the player into action quickly, selecting his platoon and vehicles and providing each unit with command and initiative ratings, perception, weapon skill, driving skill, and movement capability. After selecting one of the six missions provided, you will send your platoon into operations, where your vehicle will move as you wish... until the sequenced action rounds are triggered by the shriek of an incoming 88mm anti-tank shell, and then the fun begins.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;210 Counters (1 Large Sheet)&#10;1 22&quot; x 32 &quot; Map&#10;1 Rules Booklet&#10;1 Paragraph Booklet&#10;79 Unit Characteristics Cards&#10;1 Mission Cartridge&#10;1 Cartridge View Sleeve&#10;1 Platoon Record Sheet Pad&#10;1 8&quot; x 22&quot; Display Sheet&#10;2 Decimal Dice&#10;1 Counter Storage Tray&#10;&#10;";1988;5.72357;2.75;1;1;240;12;Adventure, Wargame, World War II;open fire solitaire tank combat wwii solitaire wargame combat adventure heroism wonder world war ii armored combat like inspire award ambush solitaire wargame open fire provide platoon american armor face variety mission change german foe variable event innumerable tactical option wealth unexpected occurrence open fire unlike tactical armor easily learn action quickly select platoon vehicle provide unit command initiative rating perception weapon skill driving skill capability select mission provide send platoon operation vehicle wish sequence action trigger shriek incoming mm anti tank shell fun begin content large sheet x map booklet paragraph booklet unit characteristic card mission cartridge cartridge view sleeve platoon record sheet pad x display sheet decimal dice storage tray

1678;The Peloponnesian War, 431-404 BC;"The Peloponnesian War lets you chart the destiny of the war. This strategic wargame of ancient warfare allows the player, with a unique new solitaire system, to try an accomplish a lasting peace. All existing solitaire systems on the market have the player take one side for the entire game. Unfortunately this pits the player against a random system with poor strategic direction. In The Peloponnesian War you get to play both sides, pitting yourself against the best you can offer. If the game system is winning, the player is forced to continue with the losing side. Success, on the other hand, will eventually force the player to change sides and recover the losing side's fortunes. The duration of the war and the player's performance determine victory. In this manner the player competes against himself in the classic tradition of the Greek tragedy.&#10;&#10;";1991;6.76532;3.127;1;2;120;12;Ancient, Wargame;peloponnesian war let chart destiny war strategic wargame ancient warfare allow unique new solitaire try accomplish last peace exist solitaire market entire unfortunately pit random poor strategic direction peloponnesian war side pit good offer force continue success hand eventually force change side recover fortune duration war performance determine manner compete classic tradition greek tragedy

1682;The Challenge;"&#239;&#187;&#191;The Challenge is a card game of deadly combat and formidable magics. (It is clearly a knockoff of Mayfair's Encounters, though it never mentions that fact.) Action is fast paced and tension-filled as characters exchange blows, fire spells, and even attempt to backstab. It is the fantasy battle at its best. &#10;More than simply hack and slash, strategy IS the key to victory, with cunning and skill playmg a central role in your success. Game play is an exercise in diplomacy and subterfuge, as &#239;&#187;&#191;treaties and trickery can make all the difference between victory and defeat. &#10;While The Challenge is easy to learn (start playing in less than 15 minutes), it has a depth far beyond that of the typical card game. With its excitment filled, strategy oriented, fullthrottled action, The Challenge is sure to become a classic. If you always loved combat the best ... take The Challenge.&#10;&#10;Sequence of Play:&#10;&#10;The player who rolled the high die goes first. Play moves clockwise around the table. The player can either challenge an opponent, pass, or declare a defensive turn.&#10;&#10;&#239;&#187;&#191;1) Challenge another character by using a Weapon Action Card, casting a spell (Advanced), using a magic item (Advanced) or using a thief skill (Advanced) from one of your characters against another character in another party. Both Character Cards involved are turned face-up (if they are not already). Then the defending player may retaliate with any appropriate card or pass. The challenging player may then continue by playing an appropriate Action Card or passing, followed by the defending player, etc., until both players have passed or one of the two characters involved in the challenge has died. After the challenge is resolved, the player whose tum it is can move one of his characters from one rank to another, discard any number of Action Cards, and draw from the Action Deck(s) until he has seven cards. The player that was defending in the challenge cannot discard, but can refill his hand up to seven. It is then the next player's tum.&#10;&#10;&#239;&#187;&#191;2) Pass - Do no actions, moving of characters, or discarding of cards.&#10;&#10;&#239;&#187;&#191;3) Defensive turn - You can't play any Action Card that directly affects another party. Play party Defensive Cards (Advanced), allocate Magic Cards (Advanced) to characters, move any number of characters from one rank to another, discard any number of Action Cards, and draw up to seven cards from either the Weapon Action deck or the Mystic Action deck (Advanced). Remember, you can't do two defensive turns back-to- back.&#10;&#10;";1990;5.80704;1.4286;2;6;60;12;Card Game, Fantasy, Fighting, Medieval;challenge card deadly combat formidable magic clearly knockoff mayfair encounter mention fact action fast pace tension fill character exchange blow fire spell attempt backstab fantasy battle good simply hack slash strategy key cunning skill playmg central role success exercise diplomacy subterfuge treaty trickery difference defeat challenge easy learn start minute depth far typical card excitment fill strategy orient fullthrottle action challenge sure classic love combat good challenge sequence high die go clockwise table challenge opponent pass declare defensive challenge character weapon action card cast spell advance magic item advance thief skill advance character character party character card involve face defend retaliate appropriate card pass challenge continue appropriate action card passing follow defend etc pass character involve challenge die challenge resolve tum character rank discard number action card draw action deck seven card defend challenge discard refill hand seven tum pass action character discarding card defensive t action card directly affect party party defensive card advance allocate magic card advance character number character rank discard number action card draw seven card weapon action deck mystic action deck advanced remember t defensive

1686;Spy vs Spy;"The object of the game is to build tunnels to bombs and bring them back to your home base.&#10;&#10;The bombs have various effects hidden on their base.  The tunnels are built through tile laying, so each player (best played with four) digs furiously from his manhole in the corner towards the bombs, hoping to reach 'em first.  If you connect tunnels, then you'll be able to try to steal another player's bomb before he brings it home.&#10;The basic turn goes like this:&#10;First, you move your pawn to another tunnel tile.&#10;Second, if you ended up or started on a bomb, test (with a special die) to see if it blows up.&#10;Third, draw a tunnel tile (you have a hand of four) and play one.&#10;Finally, if you get a bomb home safely, read its message.&#10;In addition to the tunnel tiles, there are white, black and grey spy tiles.  They are used to block tunnel tiles (each tunnel tile has a little black or white spy drawn in its middle, so you can play a White Spy only on black tunnel tiles and vice-versa; the Grey Spy can be played on either).&#10;Spy vs Spy is not be to be confused with Spion & Spion, an entirely different game by the same publisher and credited to Alex Randolph .&#10;&#10;";1986;5.62533;1.4286;2;4;90;10;Comic Book / Strip, Fighting, Maze;object build tunnel bomb bring home base bomb effect hide base tunnel build tile laying well dig furiously manhole corner bomb hope reach em connect tunnel ll able try steal bomb bring home basic go like pawn tunnel tile second end start bomb test special die blow draw tunnel tile hand finally bomb home safely read message addition tunnel tile white black grey spy tile block tunnel tile tunnel tile little black white spy draw middle white spy black tunnel tile vice versa grey spy spy vs spy confuse spion spion entirely different publisher credit alex randolph
1688;Star Commander;"&quot;Star Commander is a fast paced game of galactic domination for two to five players.  Each player (Star Commander) attempts to construct a battle fleet of space ships while preventing by any means, fair or foul, the other commanders from building theirs.  To create a fleet and keep it requires careful strategy, bold battle tactics, and rapid assessment of opportunities as they present themselves.  All the techniques of power politics, bluffs, battles, and sabotage come into play as you expand your command to interstellar supremacy.

1690;Unexploded Cow;"Europe. Summer 1997. You and your most creative friends have discovered two problems with a common solution: mad cows in England and unexploded bombs in France.

If you're lucky, you'll come home rich before Greenpeace gets hold of you.&#10;&#10;Either way, there's something magical about blowing up cows.&#10;&#10;Unexploded Cow is a money game in which players are trying to collect enough points to win the pot. On every turn, you will buy cows and pay for special effects by putting money in the pot, then try to discover bombs with your own cows in an effort to take money out of the pot. All along, you will be earning points from the French as you liberate town after town from the terrors of unexploded bombs, and the player who scores the most points gets whatever's left in the pot.&#10;&#10;Unexploded Cow is best played as a series of short games, each of which takes about thirty minutes.

1692;Spoons;"You pull from a regular deck of cards 4 of a kind for each person playing. Shuffle those all together and deal them out so each person has 4 cards. They can't look at them until the game starts though. Place spoons on the table (enough for all except one player). Position them fairly, so each person pretty much has the same chance to grab one. You have one person (this job rotates hand to hand) start calling out 'pass'. How you pass is to select one card from your hand, put it on the table face down next to the person on your right, then you pick up the card the person on your left put down. You keep doing this until 1) you get 4 of a kind or 2) someone else gets four of a kind. At this point you grab a spoon, and the person who doesn't get a spoon gets a 'pig' point. Once you get 3 pig points you are a hog. If you are a hog you have lost, but you can still be part of the game. Hogs can talk to game players, but if a game player talks to a hog they get a pig point. Of course the winner is the person left when everyone else is a hog.&#10;&#10;";1972;5.18903;1.0833;4;13;30;8;Action / Dexterity, Animals, Card Game, Children's Game, Real-time;pull regular deck card kind person shuffle deal person card t look start place spoon table position fairly person pretty chance grab person job rotate hand hand start call pass pass select card hand table face person right pick card person left kind get kind grab spoon person doesn t spoon get pig pig hog hog hog talk talk hog pig course winner person leave hog
1694;Little Round Top: The South's Best Chance at Gettysburg;"The battle of Gettysburg was a huge struggle that locked armies of the North and South in three July days of bitter warfare which turned the tide of the Civil War against the Confederacy. Among the many small actions that made up this battle none was more important than the fight for Little Round Top, a rocky forested hill on which rested the extreme left flank of the Union line. It was here that the outnumbered 20th Maine regiment held off repeated Confederate assaults, turning back the South's best chance to win this battle which they could not afford to lose.&#10;&#10;Little Round Top is Avalon Hill's new game for two players which re-creates this critical battle. During a typical game turn, both players move their company sized forces over a map of the battle area, positioning them for rifle fire and bayonet charges. Fire and melee combat are resolved by a die roll on the appropriate Combat Results Table. Regimental officers and their command abilities are crucial for keeping the attack moving forward or the defense intact.&#10;&#10;Little Round Top comes complete with a colorful map of the battlefield, 100 cardboard playing pieces, and a short rules booklet.&#10;&#10;Playing time: 2 1/2 hours&#10;&#10;Complexity rating (from 1-10, 10 the highest): 4&#10;&#10;";1979;6.44866;2.6333;2;2;150;12;American Civil War, Wargame;battle gettysburg huge struggle lock army north south july day bitter warfare tide civil war confederacy small action battle important fight little rocky forest hill rest extreme left flank union line outnumber th maine regiment hold repeat confederate assault south good chance battle afford little avalon hill new create critical battle typical company size force map battle area position rifle fire bayonet charge fire melee combat resolve die appropriate combat result table regimental officer command crucial keep attack forward defense intact little come complete colorful map battlefield cardboard piece short booklet playing time hour complexity rating high

A closer look reveals a different game.&#10;&#10;For starters, each of the 42 lands can only be occupied by a single token, which act more as visual aids than as armies per se. Combat is card--driven, each player playing from a hand of five cards. There are Artillery, Cavalry and Infantry cards, of various values; you're allowed to play up to one of each kind when attacking or defending. Joker cards can substitute for any given type. You can play your entire hand of five cards if you wish, but you only draw two per turn, so this could leave you exposed.&#10;&#10;Treason cards allow you to take over a non-contiguous land; Desertion cards allow you to get army cards from another player. The Revolution cards are very powerful as they will take over an entire continent! Luckily, there are Counter-Revolution cards in the deck as defense.&#10;&#10;A refreshing change from Risk, and certainly playable in a lot less time.&#10;&#10;";1977;6.0;0.0;2;4;45;8;Bluffing, Wargame;strategy bluff tactic object eliminate glance risk knock close look reveal different starter land occupy single token act visual aid army se combat card drive hand card artillery cavalry infantry card value allow kind attack defend joker card substitute give entire hand card wish draw leave expose treason card allow non contiguous land desertion card allow army card revolution card powerful entire continent luckily revolution card deck defense refreshing change risk certainly playable lot time
1706;UFO: Game of Close Encounters;"UFO: Game of Close Encounters is a low complexity Tactical level board-wargame themed on an Alien invasion of Earth.

1710;The Siege of Jerusalem (Third Edition);"Published by Avalon Hill in 1989 (for the Third edition).&#10;&#10;(from MMP's web site:)&#10;&#10;It is 70 A.D.  Dawn breaks on the combined might of four Legions arrayed on the heights of Mount Scopus, starting their methodical advance across the valley to the ancient walled city of Jerusalem.  Siege lines have been secured tight about the city.  There is no hope of escape.  The besieged must persist behind their stout walls or perish before a vengeful Rome.  Five grueling years of campaigning in Judea is now culminating in the Siege of Jerusalem.&#10;&#10;But the fortified city defies even the might of Rome.  The thick walls atop the steep slopes literally bristle with natural and manmade fortifications.  It will take all of Rome's considerable engineering skills to winch their war machines into position for an assault up the slopes to the city.  Only here in the north plain can the city's walls be taken by escalade.  The rhythmic approach of the Legions is muted by the rumble of the siege engines as an assortment of towers, rams, and artillery precede the maniples.  The distant walls seethe with the frenzied activity of an alerted populace as the antagonists draw near.  This majestic view is abruptly halted by the blare of trumpets which soon gives way to the cacophony of the clash of arms and screams of the dying.&#10;&#10;Morning turns to dusk before the walls are breached and the weary legions exact their vengeance.  The sky turns bright again, aglow in the reflection of a thousand fires as the northern outskirts burn.  But what price victory?  Another day such as this will break the Roman Army and only one of the city's ten walled sections has fallen this day.  They will have to find another way.  Shafts must be dug to undermine the walls or earthen ramps built with which to scale them.  It will be a long campaign.&#10;&#10;This is The Siege of Jerusalem...An epic battle simulation with all the trappings and majesty of a Cecil B. DeMille film spectacular.  Facing the greatest army of antiquity, the Judeans must rely on the stoutness of their walls to halt the unbeatable Roman legions and therein lies the fascination:  the immovable object vs the unstoppable force.  As Eliezar Ben Yair, leader of the Zealots, you must conduct a skilled defense of the city's ever shrinking perimeter - exacting from the Romans a price so terrible that they will be forced to lift their siege - or break out to continue your struggle for freedom at Massada.  As Titus, commander of the Roman army, you must decide when, where and how to renew the assault - gauging your troop needs against the progress of your siege works and the press of time caused by outside threats.  More than just conducting tactical combat, the Roman must formulate an overall strategic plan for the conduct of the siege.&#10;&#10;Vastly revised from its 1st &amp; 2nd edition printing from Historical Perspectives in the 70's, Siege of Jerusalem now boasts two-sided counters, a continuous combat system, a strategic interphase for conducting the entire siege, and the morale / panic rules so important in portraying ancient warfare.  An Introductory Scenario depicting the abortive assault of Gallus with the XII Legion three years previous allows players to learn how to handle a legion in a single day's play while training for eventual participation in the conduct of the epic siege.&#10;&#10;";1989;7.14477;3.881;2;2;300;12;Ancient, Wargame;publish avalon hill mmp web site d dawn break combined legion array height mount scopus start methodical advance valley ancient walled city jerusalem siege line secure tight city hope escape besiege persist stout wall perish vengeful rome grueling year campaign judea culminate siege jerusalem fortified city defy rome thick wall atop steep slope literally bristle natural manmade fortification rome considerable engineering skill winch war machine position assault slope city north plain city wall take escalade rhythmic approach legion mute rumble siege engine assortment tower ram artillery precede maniple distant wall seethe frenzied activity alert populace antagonist draw near majestic view abruptly halt blare trumpet soon give way cacophony clash arm scream die morning dusk wall breach weary legion exact vengeance sky bright aglow reflection thousand fire northern outskirt burn price day break roman army city walled section fall day find way shaft dig undermine wall earthen ramp build scale long campaign siege jerusalem epic battle simulation trapping majesty cecil b demille film spectacular face great army antiquity judean rely stoutness wall halt unbeatable roman legion lie fascination immovable object vs unstoppable force eliezar ben yair leader zealot conduct skilled defense city shrink perimeter exact romans price terrible force lift siege break continue struggle freedom massada titus commander roman army decide renew assault gauge troop need progress siege work press time cause outside threat conduct tactical combat roman formulate overall strategic plan conduct siege vastly revise st amp nd print historical perspective siege jerusalem boast sided continuous combat strategic interphase conduct entire siege morale panic important portray ancient warfare introductory depict abortive assault gallus xii legion year previous allow learn handle legion single day training eventual participation conduct epic siege
1712;Showbiz;"In the game, players take on the roles of theatre managers and must hire performers that will bring in the most money from the public.  There are six different styles of performers, and at different times in the game, public opinion will favour different styles.  Public preference is determined by dealing out cards from a special deck.  The current opinion is always known, and a possible (but not necessarily accurate) forecast of future preferences is also provided.&#10;&#10;Each turn, public opinion changes (sometimes to match the forecast, and sometimes into something completely random), then players use a bidding system to acquire contracts with performers.  Once contracts have been negotiated, profit is calculated depending on how well performers match the public's desires.&#10;&#10;By the time twelve turns have been played (and possibly one or two turns sooner), the game will come to an end and the player with the highest score is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;The game was originally published by the designer in 1984 (or earlier).  Hexagames published a German edition (which is the only one that handles up to 8 players) in 1988.  Avalon Hill published their edition (with very minor changes) in 1990.&#10;&#10;";1984;6.07579;2.0;2;8;90;8;Movies / TV / Radio theme;role theatre manager hire performer bring money public different style performer different time public opinion favour different style public preference determine deal card special deck current opinion know possible necessarily accurate forecast future preference provide public opinion change match forecast completely random use bidding acquire contract performer contract negotiate profit calculate depend performer match public desire time possibly soon come end high declare winner originally publish designer early hexagame publish german handle avalon hill publish minor change
1714;Moonstar;"First was published 'Corona' (1974). Moonstar (1981) added planets and variants&#10;(variant number 8 is Corona, without sand timer). &#10;'Harun' (1984) is not new game, it is a rethemed copy of Moonstar! &#10;'Orbit' (1993) a new variation including the Corona variations &amp; Harun.&#10;Finally, Randolph recycled most of the game into his 'Rasende Roboter' ('Ricochet Robots') (1999) , although the course mechanism and the objective were completely changed.&#10;&#10;Quite possibly the first &quot;German&quot; game to cross the Atlantic...&#10;&#10;About the game (from the back of the box)&#10;&#10;Moonstar is a game unlike any other game for any number of people. All the action is governed by dice, yet there is no luck involved. The dice simply establish the situation. It is up to the players to act upon it. A game with endless variety.&#10;&#10;Playable by any number of people, from one to a hundred, Moonstar combines numbers calculations, memory, and quick-thinking into a fast-playing, action-packed, exciting contest of pure skill.&#10;&#10;The board represents the twelve constellations (stars) of the Zodiac and the playing pieces represent moons and planets. Each game consists of a number of rounds of play. In each round, the board and playing pieces are first setup by one of the players. Then the dice are thrown. A one-minute auction period begins. Each player may bid any number of times in the auction or not at all. Each bid, however, must be higher than the previous one. When the one-minute runs out, the highest bidder plays that round.&#10;&#10;The play of the round also lasts one minute. A player plays a round by placing one die on each moon on the, board and then moving that moon (and die) a number of stars equal to the number of the die. The die is then removed and the moon may not be moved again. This procedure is followed for each moon. The player must move each moon before the time runs out, or those moons which have not been moved may not move.&#10;&#10;The player's score is then totaled to see if he has made his bid, by scoring a number of points for each moon, depending on which stars and planets they have landed on, If a player makes his bid, he scores a number of points equal to his bid. If he fails, he scores nothing. Rounds are setup and played in this manner until one player has scored enough points to win.&#10;&#10;But this is only the beginning. Moonstar is actually twelve games in one. Game One is simply the Basic Game. Games Two-Twelve each change one or more parts of Game One, or add something to it. They introduce things like challenging bids, side bets, more moons, more dice, different planet values, no planets. and advanced scoring methods.&#10;&#10;Includes:&#10;&#10;    16&quot; x 16&quot; gameboard&#10;    15 moon pieces&#10;    21 planet pieces&#10;    1 minute sand timer&#10;    11 6-sided dice&#10;    rulebook&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Corona&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Orbit&#10;    Ricochet Robots&#10;&#10;&#10;";1981;5.18096;1.75;2;12;30;12;Abstract Strategy, Dice;publish corona moonstar add planet number corona sand timer harun new rethemed copy moonstar orbit new variation include corona variations amp harun finally randolph recycle rasende roboter ricochet robot course mechanism completely change possibly german cross atlantic box moonstar unlike number people action govern dice luck involve dice simply establish situation act endless variety playable number people moonstar combine number calculation memory quick thinking fast playing action pack exciting contest pure skill represent constellation star zodiac piece represent moon planet consist number piece dice throw minute auction period begin bid number time auction bid high previous minute run high bidder last minute place die moon moon die number star equal number die die remove moon procedure follow moon moon time run moon total bid number moon depend star planet land make bid number equal bid fail manner beginning moonstar actually simply basic change part add introduce thing like challenging bid bet moon dice different planet value planet advanced method include x gameboard moon piece planet piece minute sand timer side dice rulebook implement corona implement orbit ricochet robot
1716;Knights of the Air;"[From the back of the Avalon Hill game box]&#10;&#10;They were a part of Europe's &ldquo;next Generation&rdquo;, asked to march to war before they had tasted of life's joys and sorrows.&#10;&#10;They were cut from a special cloth, singled out to do a job that demanded intelligence, endurance, steadiness and coordination of the highest order.&#10;&#10;They dueled to the death in fragile machines, only just invented ten years before, miles above the earth.&#10;&#10;They were brave soldiers to their comrades in arms and heroes to their public.&#10;&#10;They were the fighter pilots of the Great War &ndash; THE KNIGHTS OF THE AIR.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill's game, KNIGHTS OF THE AIR, recreates the deadly combat of the World War I air war.  You learn to fly the great airplanes of the period much in the same way the Aces did &ndash; rig in the cockpit using control stick, throttle and rudder pedals.  Each kind of warplane included in the game has been carefully researched to present the same strengths, weaknesses and idiosyncrasies it demonstrated in real life.  Once you have learned the tricks of your aircraft, you can dare to risk all in a dogfight.  Air combat is conducted in a series of maneuvers as each pilot tries to position his plane for the killing run.  With experience, new and more complicated maneuvers become available so that the ace can barrel roll and loop rings around the novice.  Your success will depend upon your ability to master your plane and to exploit the weaknesses of your enemy's.&#10;&#10;Some Features:&#10;- Your Abilities to improve with experience, An Ace can react quicker, aim his gunfire more accurately, and undertake more complicated maneuvers than a novice can.&#10;&#10;- Each kind of airplane in the game has been designed to perform just like its real-life counterpart.  Rates of climb and dive, maximum and stall speeds, and turning abilities all compare favorably with test flight results.&#10;&#10;-You guide your airplane on the gameboard using real controls.  You adjust speed with the control stick and the rates of dive and climb with the throttle.&#10;&#10;- Special attention was directed, during the design, to develop a simple method of allowing one plane to tail another.  The reflexes of both airplane and pilot are a crucial factor in this procedure.&#10;&#10;- With the wide choice of airplanes included, a practically unlimited variety of dogfights may be staged.  Many of the greatest warplanes are there the Sopwith Camel, SE 5a, SPAD, Nieuport, Bristol Fighter, Fokker Triplane, Fokker DVII, Albatros, Pfalz, Roland and more.&#10;&#10;- Special solitaire scenarios have been created to restage attacks against Zeppelin airships and two-seater warplanes.&#10;&#10;Complexity: Medium&#10;Solitaire Suitability: High&#10;&#10;Each game contains:&#10;- A 22&rdquo;x32&rdquo; full-color gameboard depicting a section of trenchline on the Western Front.  Actual battlefield photographs were consulted during the construction.&#10;- Hundreds f die-cut playing pieces representing all of the airplanes and various markers needed for record-keeping.&#10;- Six sets of maneuver cards.  Each card contains a diagram of a specific maneuver just as it was actually flown.&#10;- A set of Airplane Performance Cards.  A different card has been prepared for each airplane.&#10;- Three six-sided dice&#10;&#10;";1987;6.17004;3.4839;1;6;150;12;Aviation / Flight, Wargame, World War I;avalon hill box europe ldquo generation rdquo ask march war taste life joy sorrow cut special cloth single job demand intelligence endurance steadiness coordination high order duel death fragile machine invent year mile earth brave soldier comrade arm hero public fighter pilot great war ndash knight air avalon hill knight air recreate deadly combat world war air war learn fly great airplane period way ace ndash rig cockpit stick throttle rudder pedal kind warplane include carefully research present strength weakness idiosyncrasy demonstrate real life learn trick aircraft dare risk dogfight air combat conduct series maneuver pilot try position plane killing run experience new complicated maneuver available ace barrel loop ring novice success depend master plane exploit weakness enemy improve experience ace react quick aim gunfire accurately undertake complicated maneuver novice kind airplane perform like real life counterpart rate climb dive maximum stall speed compare favorably test flight result guide airplane gameboard real adjust speed stick rate dive climb throttle special attention direct develop simple method allow plane tail reflex airplane pilot crucial factor procedure wide airplane include practically unlimited variety dogfight stage great warplane sopwith camel se spad nieuport bristol fighter fokker triplane fokker dvii albatros pfalz roland special solitaire create restage attack zeppelin airships seater warplane complexity medium solitaire suitability high contain rdquo x rdquo color gameboard depict section trenchline western actual battlefield photograph consult construction hundred f die cut piece represent airplane marker need record keep set maneuver card card contain diagram specific maneuver actually fly set airplane performance card different card prepare airplane sided dice
1718;Foreign Exchange;"From the back of the box:&#10;&#10;At last - a money game for adults!&#10;&#10;Be forewarned!  This game might not be for you...unless you are a student of the international money market.  Or, you are just plain curious as to why the US dollar is worth less and less despite the fact that we are still the strongest nation in the world.&#10;&#10;Simply put, Foreign Exchange is not a toy.&#10;&#10;A perfect simulation of the international currency situation, it is!&#10;&#10;International companies realize gains and losses when changing currency rates alter the value of their income and assets in foreign countries.  This game simulates this situation by letting players own and manage multi-national companies in various cities throughout the world.  As in the real world, changing conditions require each player to make constant decisions after considering his company's financial resources - and what he expects his opponents to make - against the cost of alternative protective strategies.&#10;&#10;The Iranian oil situation of early '79 is a classic real-life example.  Iran furnishes less than 7% of America's petroleum needs.  Yet its unavailability has done more to devalue the dollar against gold than any economic crises since the depression of 1939. Why so, you may ask.&#10;&#10;Playing Foreign Exchange will give you insight into this question, and you'll have fun doing so because the game focuses on the interplayer relationships.  Without such interplay relationships, no game is fun to play.  With it, Foreign Exchange might just be the greatest money game to come along since Monopoly.&#10;&#10;Ironically, it doesn't come with any money.  All financial transactions are recorded on a variety of accounting pads included.  If you're into pencils, you'll love this game (some enterprising money -market enthusiasts have already programmed this game on computer).&#10;&#10;You - as company head - decide where in the world (literally) you want to establish sales and manufacturing offices.  This is done at the beginning through a round of trading City Cards among players until everyone is satisfied they've outsmarted their opponents.&#10;&#10;From this point on, a variety of situations and happenstances will determine likely changes in currency rates.  You - the manufacturer - must plan the strategies you think best to maximize gains.&#10;&#10;Foreign Exchange was designed by a professional money-management expert and executive officer of the leading financial institution.  What is duck soup to him, however, might be unfathomable to the novice.  That's why the game comes in three versions: a &quot;Beginning&quot; version for game buffs intrigued by money games; the &quot;Intermediate&quot; game for those with a cursory knowledge of what's going on with foreign currency; and the &quot;Expert&quot; game for those people who really have a yen for this sort of thing.&#10;&#10;Includes:&#10;2-piece fold-out game board&#10;Foreign Exchange Worksheet pad&#10;Net Worth Worksheet pad&#10;Hedging Cost Worksheet pad&#10;24 City Cards&#10;4 Borrowing Cost cards&#10;16 Currency Exchange cards&#10;16 Risk cards&#10;5 player tokens&#10;40 colored markers for 4 different colors&#10;2 6-sided dice&#10;Rules&#10;&#10;";1978;4.4025;2.7;2;4;60;12;Economic;box money adult forewarn student international money market plain curious dollar worth despite fact strong nation world simply foreign exchange toy perfect simulation international currency situation international company realize gain loss change currency rate alter value income asset foreign country simulate situation let manage multi national company city world real world change condition require constant decision consider company financial resource expect opponent cost alternative protective strategy iranian oil situation early classic real life example iran furnish america petroleum need unavailability devalue dollar gold economic crisis depression ask foreign exchange insight question ll fun focus interplayer relationship interplay relationship fun foreign exchange great money come monopoly ironically doesn t come money financial transaction record variety accounting pad include pencil ll love enterprise money market enthusiast program computer company head decide world literally want establish sale manufacturing office beginning trade city card satisfied ve outsmart opponent variety situation happenstance determine likely change currency rate manufacturer plan strategy think well maximize gain foreign exchange professional money management expert executive officer lead financial institution duck soup unfathomable novice come begin buff intrigue money intermediate cursory knowledge go foreign currency expert people yen sort thing include piece fold foreign exchange worksheet pad net worth worksheet pad hedging cost worksheet pad city card borrow cost card currency exchange card risk card token colored marker different color side dice

Eventually, Greg published a wargame based on his world called White Bear and Red Moon. In fact, Chaosium was founded to allow Stafford to publish this boardgame! This game later became the excellent Dragon Pass game. White Bear and Red Moon was enough of a hit to spawn a second war game, Nomad Gods, and, more importantly, inspired some D&amp;D fans to write a gaming system that would allow role-playing in Glorantha. Thus was RuneQuest born.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    White Bear & Red Moon&#10;&#10;&#10;";1980;6.99075;3.4426;2;3;120;12;Fantasy, Wargame;remake chaosium white bear red moon publish oriflam la guerre des h eacute ros french dragon pass japanese hobby japan role world glorantha create semi public domain project greg stafford mental exercise eventually greg publish wargame base world call white bear red moon fact chaosium found allow stafford publish boardgame later excellent dragon pass white bear red moon hit spawn second war nomad god importantly inspire d amp d fan write gaming allow role playing glorantha runequest bear implements white bear red moon
1722;Caesar's Legions;"Caesar's Legions is a medium complexity wargame simulating the Roman campaigns in Germany at the operational level.&#10;&#10;Players choose from 5 scenarios ranging from Caesar's own Germanic campaigns to the Batavian revolt of 70 AD.&#10;&#10;Movement is hex based.  Tactical cards effect combat resolution which is dice based and cross-referenced on a probability table.  Roman units are divided into cohorts.  German units are divided into tribes and enjoy hidden movement when in forest terrain.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a 22&quot; x 28&quot; map board, over 400 counters (448 counters), playing aids, 16 tactical cards (2 sets of 1 - 8) and a 16-page rulebook.&#10;&#10;";1975;6.21942;2.75;2;2;90;12;Ancient, Wargame;caesar legion medium complexity wargame simulate roman campaign germany operational choose range caesar germanic campaign batavian revolt ad hex base tactical card effect combat resolution dice base cross reference probability table roman unit divide cohort german unit divide tribe enjoy hidden forest terrain consist x map aid tactical card set page rulebook
1724;Bureaucracy;"From the back of the box&#10;&#10;Bureaucracy is a somewhat less complicated version of The Great Chain of Being, a medieval, theological, parlor game, first uncovered in a small church in Urbino during the renovation of an ancient, holy, but clearly inadequate, sewage system.  Both the Church and the monastic Parkover Brothels deny the authenticity of the game.  As one official noted, &quot;that's a crock&quot;.&#10;&#10;Bureaucracy is designed to simulate the bureaucratic behavior which constitutes so much of what we call government.  It is convoluted, Byzantine, and entertaining.  It is also cost effective, feasible, and administratively impossible.  In its early stages, Bureaucracy required a fifteen story parlor, a six acre gameboard, 200,000 pieces, and a 15,000 page rulebook.  Of course, this prototype was unwieldy.  Consequently, we were forced to simplify the game.  The present version is good for two to eight players.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game at the lowest organizational level.  The winner is the player who rises up through the masses to become the Director of the Bureaucracy.&#10;&#10;Players may select one of four lifestyles, each with its own advantages and disadvantages: lifer, over achiever, empire builder, or hustler.  To be promoted from level to level, a player will need the required number of promotional prerequisites and that's where the fun comes in.  All sorts of things can happen.  Players may be demoted.  They may be involved in scandals.  They may become involved in power plays.  They may have to go before a Grievance Committee.  A player may even go bankrupt and have to start all over from the bottom again.  There is no one sure formula for success.  Players will have to stay out of trouble and use all their cunning to succeed.&#10;&#10;This is a game that makes being a part of the bureaucracy fun  It will make you laugh at government and yourself at the same time.    For civil servants, it's required recreation.  For just you and me, it's a must.  Don't be surprised though, when you open the box and hear the call of the jungle.  It's a wild game.&#10;&#10;Game includes a 22 x 24 gameboard, 2 dice, 240 promotional prerequisite pieces, 20 power play pieces, 64 player tokens, a pack of money, 80 lifestyle cards, 20 memo cards, 20 consumer goods cards, 8 bucks, 1 power file, and two rulebooks (one to explain what it says in the simple game rules)&#10;&#10;";1981;4.20179;2.25;2;8;90;12;Humor, Political;box bureaucracy somewhat complicated great chain medieval theological parlor uncover small church urbino renovation ancient holy clearly inadequate sewage church monastic parkover brothel deny authenticity official note crock bureaucracy simulate bureaucratic behavior constitute government convoluted byzantine entertaining cost effective feasible administratively impossible early stage bureaucracy require story parlor acre gameboard piece page rulebook course prototype unwieldy consequently force simplify present good start low organizational winner rise masse director bureaucracy select lifestyle advantage disadvantage lifer achiever empire builder hustler promote need require number promotional prerequisite fun come sort thing happen demote involve scandal involved power grievance committee bankrupt start sure formula success stay trouble use cunning succeed make bureaucracy fun laugh government time civil servant require recreation don t surprised open box hear jungle wild include x gameboard dice promotional prerequisite piece power piece token pack money lifestyle card memo card consumer good card buck power file rulebook explain say simple

1730;Trap the Cap;"An age-old children's game, for which multiple variants exist.  Multiple editors and editions.&#10;&#10;In the common version of the game, players roll the dice to move their &quot;caps&quot; around the board.  If a player lands on another cap or a stack of caps, that player captures the stack by nesting his or her cap on top of the stack.  A player then seeks to return that stack of caps to home-base to keep them.  The game ends when there is only one active color of caps left on the board.  In one version of the game, the winner is the player who captured the most caps of other colors during the course of the game.  In the other version of the game, the player who has active caps left on the board is the winner.&#10;&#10;According to Miscellaneous Game Book this was first published in 1927 by Otto Maier Verlag.

1758;Advanced Heroquest;"Advanced HeroQuest is a dungeon crawl related thematically to HeroQuest (which was a co-development with Milton Bradley) but mechanically wholly unrelated to that game.  While the basic concept of both is the same, four heroes venture into a dungeon to fight monsters and gain treasure, but Advanced HeroQuest's rules are more detailed and complex.&#10;&#10;The major additions and changes include:&#10;&#10;    fully solo playability&#10;    more complex combat system (role to hit versus target's weapon skill, then roll to wound vs target's toughness), including ranged combat, critical hits and fumbles&#10;    two phases of game play: exploration, combat&#10;    random dungeon generation system&#10;    modular game board&#10;    multiple colleges of magic and spell books&#10;    henchmen (in base game, as opposed to being in an expansion)&#10;    fate points (the &quot;undo&quot; feature)&#10;&#10;&#10;Games Workshop set Advanced HeroQuest in the Warhammer universe, presumably to foster sales of their miniatures.  The campaign world is easy to ignore, however, should players rather keep things generic.  Advanced HeroQuest also includes rules for using the characters and monsters from HeroQuest, should players want to do so.&#10;&#10;The game is supplied with Skaven figures that make up the quest within the rulebook.

1765;HeroQuest: Against the Ogre Horde;"Morcar sat motionless on his throne of pure jet, deep in thought. His eyes scanned the image of the Emperor&rsquo;s lands which he had conjured before him. He had been so close to victory, so nearly had he trapped and destroyed the Emperor and his forces in the ancient fortress at Karak Varn. But he had been foiled at the last minute by the Emperor&rsquo;s accursed Champions. The same fate had befallen his powerful ally, the Witch Lord, whose Army of the Dead had crumbled following the slaying of their leader.&#10;&#10;Morcar needed some new and subtle means to attack the Empire and weaken its forces before he could lead his armies against them once more. Suddenly his gaze froze and a smile sent ripples through the lines of his ancient face. A plan had come to him.&#10;&#10;A month later, Morcar again sat back to examine the scheme he had set in motion. He had never before considered the ancient race of Ogres as a potential tool. Their undisciplined and random nature made them unreliable as servants and dangerous as allies. However, using the magical arts at his disposal, Morcar had planted one of his Chaos sorcerers, Festral, within the subterranean fortress of the infamous Dirgrusht Ogre clan. Drawing from a magical pool of Chaos power, Festral had subtly taken control of the Ogre clan and started them on a series of raids on the Empire&rsquo;s farmlands. This was only the beginning, for as raids went on, other Ogre clans and Orc tribes came to swell the ranks of this new army.&#10;&#10;Contents.&#10;&#10;A new Quest Book containing 7 new adventures that must be played in sequence with rules for variable Body Points, Chaos Sorcerer Spells (Mind Lock, Dominate and Mind Blast) and new dungeon features.&#10;&#10;7 finely detailed Citadel Miniatures that require assembly featuring:&#10;- 1 Ogre Lord&#10;- 1 Ogre Chieftain&#10;- 1 Ogre Champion&#10;- 4 Ogre Warriors&#10;&#10;New full-colour die-cut game board overlays including:&#10;- 1 new large overground starting tile&#10;- 2 new double-sided room tiles&#10;- 15 Chaos Spell tokens&#10;- 4 Stone Doorways&#10;- 4 Pit of Darkness tokens&#10;- 4 Secret Door tokens&#10;- 6 Fallen Rubble tokens&#10;- 1 Ogre Throne&#10;&#10;Expands&#10;&#10;    HeroQuest&#10;&#10;&#10;";1990;7.46266;2.4828;2;5;120;8;Expansion for Base-game, Exploration, Fantasy, Fighting, Miniatures;morcar sit motionless throne pure jet deep thought eye scan image emperor rsquo land conjure close nearly trap destroy emperor force ancient fortress karak varn foil minute emperor rsquo accurse champion fate befall powerful ally witch lord army dead crumble follow slaying leader morcar need new subtle mean attack empire weaken force lead army suddenly gaze freeze smile send ripple line ancient face plan come month later morcar sit examine scheme set motion consider ancient race ogre potential tool undisciplined random nature unreliable servant dangerous ally magical art disposal morcar plant chaos sorcerer festral subterranean fortress infamous dirgrusht ogre clan draw magical pool chaos power festral subtly take ogre clan start series raid empire rsquo farmland beginning raid go ogre clan orc tribe come swell rank new army content new quest book contain new adventure sequence variable body chaos sorcerer spell mind lock dominate mind blast new dungeon finely detailed citadel miniature require assembly ogre lord ogre chieftain ogre champion ogre warrior new colour die cut overlay include new large overground start tile new double sided room tile chaos spell tokens stone doorway pit darkness token secret door tokens fall rubble token ogre throne expand heroquest
1767;HeroQuest: Wizards of Morcar;"A Glimpse of Chaos&hellip;&#10;&#10;As the rain lashed down and thunder rumbled across the sky, a brief flash of lightning illuminated a bedraggled group of travellers. Their slow climb up the rocky slopes to the foreboding tower at the summit seemed to last an eternity. At last the figures escaped the storm and entered a dark hallway. As they peered into the shadows, they saw a sinister figure on a rocky throne.&#10;&#10;A solitary traveller stepped forward from the huddled and dripping group and addressed the presence on the throne.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;My Lord Morcar, we come bearing grave tidings. We must report the failure of your plan to raise the Ogre Horde against the Empire. Once again we were routed by those accursed Champions and once again we were forced to flee.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;The figure on the throne shifted and a voice like death broke the silence.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;I am aware of your failure, Festral. But as in all things I have learned from my failures. Firstly I have learned not to underestimate the Emperor&rsquo;s Heroes. Secondly, I have learned not to rely on fools. I have therefore conceived a new scheme to destroy the Emperor&rsquo;s Heroes forever. I have chosen four Lieutenants to carry out my plan. Come forth my Lieutenants.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;With that command, four silhouettes stepped from the shadows.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Let me present Zanrath, High Mage of Sarako.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;An ancient bearded man wearing a pointed hat and carrying a staff topped with a crescent moon bowed down towards Festral and his retinue.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Fanrax the Malicious.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;At the mention of his name, an evil-looking man adorned with skull symbols and toying with a wickedly sharp dagger gave a sneering smile at the group.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Boroush, the Storm Master.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;With sweep of his oaken staff, a ragged and bearded figure greeted the refugees.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;And finally, Grawshak, Orc Shaman of the Northern Tribes.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;The last of the four Lieutenants, an Orc decorated in skins, feathers and skulls, carrying a massive totem wand growled what might have been a greeting or a curse at the party.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;I believe that these four Sorcerers will succeed where you have so miserably failed. And it is they who will punish you for your failure.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;With this final word, Morcar disappeared into the shadows. From here he watched with great satisfaction as his four sorcerous Lieutenants erased all trace of Festral and his followers. Mocar smiled. These were indeed the ones who would finally destroy the Emperor&rsquo;s Heroes forever.&#10;&#10;Wizards of Morcar introduces two new elements to the HeroQuest game - four Evil Sorcerers (each with their own new spells) and Men-at-Arms to aid the Heroes on their quests.&#10;&#10;Contents.&#10;&#10;16 finely detailed Citadel Miniatures featuring:&#10;- 4 new Sorcerer Figures, 12 Men-at-Arms Figures and 24 weapons.&#10;- 1 Quest Book containing new rules and&#10;- 5 new Quests&#10;- 1 Card Sheet including:&#10;- 1 Magic Reference Chart,&#10;- 3 Magical Barriers (Stone, Fire and Ice),&#10;- 1 Earthquake Tile,&#10;- 1 Lightning Bolt Tile,&#10;- 1 Cloak of Shadows Tile,&#10;- 4 Fireburst Tokens,&#10;- 6 Blocked Square Markers,&#10;- 4 Breached Wall Tiles.&#10;&#10;- 24 Evil Sorcerer Spell Cards,&#10;- 9 new Wizard and Elf Spell Cards,&#10;- 23 Men-at-Arms Cards,&#10;- 8 new Treasure Cards.&#10;&#10;Expands&#10;&#10;    HeroQuest&#10;&#10;&#10;";1991;7.57846;2.375;2;5;120;10;Expansion for Base-game, Exploration, Fantasy, Fighting;glimpse chaos hellip rain lash thunder rumble sky brief flash lightning illuminate bedraggle group traveller slow climb rocky slope foreboding tower summit eternity figure escape storm enter dark hallway peer shadow see sinister figure rocky throne solitary traveller step forward huddled dripping group address presence throne ldquo lord morcar come bear grave tiding report failure plan raise ogre horde empire route accurse champion force flee rdquo figure throne shift voice like death break silence ldquo aware failure festral thing learn failure firstly learn underestimate emperor rsquo hero secondly learn rely fool conceive new scheme destroy emperor rsquo hero forever choose lieutenant carry plan come forth lieutenant rdquo command silhouette step shadow ldquo let present zanrath high mage sarako rdquo ancient bearded man wear pointed hat carry staff top crescent moon bow festral retinue ldquo fanrax malicious rdquo mention evil look man adorn skull symbol toy wickedly sharp dagger give sneer smile group ldquo boroush storm master rdquo sweep oaken staff ragged bearded figure greet refugee ldquo finally grawshak orc shaman northern tribe rdquo lieutenant orc decorate skin feather skull carry massive totem wand growl greeting curse party ldquo believe sorcerer succeed miserably fail punish failure rdquo final word morcar disappear shadow watch great satisfaction sorcerous lieutenant erase trace festral follower mocar smile one finally destroy emperor rsquo hero forever wizard morcar introduce new element heroqu evil sorcerer new spell man arm aid hero quest content finely detailed citadel miniature new sorcerer figure man arm figure weapon quest book contain new new quest card sheet include magic reference chart magical barrier stone fire ice earthquake tile lightning bolt tile cloak shadow tile fireburst token block square marker breach wall tile evil sorcerer spell card new wizard elf spell card man arm card new treasure card expand heroquest

Players move their explorer pawns up the sides of the mountain along paths and through caves, trying to reach the top of the mountain, retrieve the idol's giant ruby, and take it down the other side to the waiting boat. However, both the idol and volcanic vents throughout the board periodically spit out &quot;fireball&quot; marbles, which physically roll down the mountain, either plowing through explorer pawns in their path, or toppling triggered bridges as they pass under them.&#10;&#10;";1986;6.44161;1.3358;2;4;45;7;Action / Dexterity, Adventure, Children's Game;plastic tiki idol place raise middle molded d rotate freely explorer pawn side mountain path cave try reach mountain retrieve idol giant ruby waiting boat idol volcanic vent periodically spit fireball marble physically mountain plow explorer pawn path topple trigger bridge pass

1773;Dawn of the Dead;"Dawn of the Dead (based on the classic 1978 horror film) can be played as a two-player game (humans vs. zombies), as a solitaire game, or as a cooperative game with two to four players controlling the human heroes. The game map represents the shopping mall from the movie.  Cardboard counters signify the four human characters and randomly-sized groups of zombies.  Play is highly asymmetric &mdash; the humans are fast but badly outnumbered and subject to paralyzing panic attacks, while the zombies are slow but relentless and unlimited.  To win, the zombies must kill the humans; the humans must secure the mall by closing all four entrances and eliminating all zombies within.

1774;Sale of the Century;"Based on the game show, players are asked general knowledge questions and race to come up with the right answer. Right answers win money, wrong ones lose it. At several points throughout the game, players are offered the chance to buy discounted merchandise using the money they have built up. The catch is that no player knows just how valuable the item is, only that it is offered at less than full value. After fifteen questions, the player with the most money can either buy a more expensive prize with their winnings, or keep their money in hopes of winning again, and being able to buy something even better. After each person has had a chance to host, the player with the most money and merchandise is the winner.&#10;&#10;Two editions were made of the original 1969-74 series, although the first was reprinted (in 1971?) with an altered cover: one prize was changed to a TV, and the set shot cuts off the left side (where the host is) in favor of another prize.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;     Sale of the Century Quizzard&#10;&#10;&#10;";1969;5.57667;2.0;3;5;30;10;Movies / TV / Radio theme, Trivia;base ask general knowledge question race come right answer right answer money wrong one offer chance buy discount merchandise money build catch know valuable item offer value question money buy expensive prize winning money hope able buy well person chance host money merchandise winner original series reprint altered cover prize change tv set shot cut left host favor prize implement sale century quizzard

1776;Divine Right: Scarlet Empire;"Starting in 1997, Glenn Rahman designed an extension to his fabulous game Divine Right.  Scarlet Empire took place in a different period in that game's world, and further to the south of the original map.  It was designed as a stand alone game that could also be played in combination with the other one.  The campaign game pits most of the players against the one playing the Scarlet Witch King.&#10;&#10;If you liked Divine Right, you'd like Scarlet Empire -- everything that made the first game great is also present in the other.  Mercenaries, special locations, diplomacy, magic, etc.&#10;&#10;Scarlet Empire was supposed to be published by Excalibre Games and made it as far as the advanced play-test stages, but the publisher hemmed and hawed and tried to cut costs, so much so Glen eventually gave up in disgust.

1780;Knights of Camelot;"Knights of Camelot ranks right alongside Divine Right; it is an early TSR game brimming with flavour.&#10;&#10;The players are freshly knighted and wander the Arthurian realm looking for damsels in distress, brigands, monsters, other knights to joust with, etc. The game uses a random table generation driver that can lead to an enormous variety of encounters. I remember fondly two incidents:&#10;&#10;In the first, a knight met a Dwarf on a horse. Deciding to approach and meet him (instead of avoiding or charging), the dwarf turned out to be a knight in disguise&mdash;but not just any knight! It was Lancelot, the foremost knight of the realm! We had a sudden vision of the hollowed-out horse necessary to hide Lancelot's bulk&hellip;&#10;&#10;In another incident, a player led a charmed life and pulled ahead of the others in their quest for the Holy Grail. He met Merlin repeatedly and ended up with a special charger, magic lance, and magic shield&mdash;the works! England wasn't much of a challenge for him any more, so he decided to cross the Channel to France. Bad move! His ship sank in a storm so he washed up on the shore minus all his equipment and followers. Dejected, he trudged to the nearest castle to ask for help&mdash;but a giant jumped out of the moat and killed him in one blow!&#10;&#10;The game has heavy role-playing elements to it; articles in Dragon Magazine, Issue# 58 explained how one could play knaves (bad knights), and GMs have been known to use the game as an adventure generator for RPGs.&#10;&#10;";1980;6.536;2.4286;2;6;240;12;Adventure, Fantasy, Medieval, Wargame;knight camelot rank right alongside divine right early tsr brim flavour freshly knight wander arthurian realm look damsel distress brigand monster knight joust etc use random table generation driver lead enormous variety encounter remember fondly incident knight meet dwarf horse decide approach meet instead avoid charge dwarf knight disguise mdash knight lancelot foremost knight realm sudden vision hollowed horse necessary hide lancelot bulk hellip incident lead charmed life pull ahead quest holy grail meet merlin repeatedly end special charger magic lance magic shield mdash works england wasn t challenge decide cross channel france bad ship sink storm wash shore minus equipment follower deject trudge near castle ask help mdash giant jump moat kill blow heavy role element article dragon magazine issue explain knave bad knight gms know use adventure generator rpgs

In it, the two players represent Life and Death, respectively, and each tries to guide a horror story to their corresponding outcome.  As well as horror, the creator suggests that the game could be used for a science-fiction or mystery story, although the game's cards may be poorly suited to this.&#10;&#10;The second edition was packaged with a magazine called The Cultist.

1785;King's Bounty;"Released in 1991 by Task Force Games, King's Bounty resembles its like-named 1990 computer game counterpart from New World Computing: the players are rival bounty hunters, each riding through the kingdom, hunting down monsters and other miscreants upon whose heads the king has put a prize. Despite the release dates, the board game was actually designed prior to the computer game.&#10;&#10;The turn-based computer game's origin began with fighting mechanics that were meant to have a similar flavor to Avalon Hill's Titan, but the program lacked a story-line and theme. Meanwhile, development of the King's Bounty board game was wrapping up under the working title of &quot;Bounty Hunter.&quot; New World Computing, which owned Task Force Games at the time, decided to have the computer game adopt a storyline and theme similar to that of the board game.&#10;&#10;The computer game, designed by Jon Van Caneghem, is notably considered the forerunner of the Heroes of Might and Magic series of computer and video games. A sequel to the original computer game, called King's Bounty: The Legend, was released in 2008.&#10;&#10;New World Computing transferred ownership of Task Force Games  prior to the production of the board game, which delayed the board game's release. The major remaining component that had to be completed was final production and layout of the rule book, which is why rules artwork changed from that produced for other game components. However, the box cover art, originally contracted and completed for the board game and then adopted by the computer game, remained unchanged upon the board game's release.&#10;&#10;";1991;5.62246;2.5556;1;8;300;12;Fantasy, Fighting, Video Game Theme;release task force games king bounty resemble like name computer counterpart new world compute rival bounty hunter riding kingdom hunt monster miscreant head king prize despite release date actually prior computer base computer origin begin fight mean similar flavor avalon hill titan program lack story line development king bounty wrap work title bounty hunter new world computing own task force time decide computer adopt storyline similar computer jon van caneghem notably consider forerunner hero magic series computer video sequel original computer call king bounty legend release new world computing transfer ownership task force prior production delay release major remain component complete final production layout book artwork change produce component box cover art originally contract complete adopt computer remain unchanged release

Gold is money.  Advance enough in tech, and your cities can go into orbit and eventually reach the other planets.

1796;Pampas Railroads;"Players vie for control of six railroads in Argentina.  A deck of cards (3 Offer Stock, 4 Develop Settlements, 5 Construct Track) is used each round to determine player actions.  The deck is passed to the left and an action taken until there is just one action card type left in the deck.  Dividends are then paid (based on railroad value and total number of shares), and a new round is started.  The game lasts for nine rounds, at which time a final payoff is made based on value, income, and actual shares sold.  There are only 5 shares of each railroad available, with the money from the stock purchase going into the railroad treasury.  Also, all track construction must be paid for out of railroad treasuries, and the track is drawn along pre-defined routes using plastic crayons.  Settlements are developed using player funds, which in turn increases the income available to a railroad.  The player with the most money after the final payoff wins.&#10;&#10;The fourth game in the Prairie Railroads Series.&#10;&#10;";2001;7.07041;3.3214;3;6;120;12;Economic, Trains;vie railroad argentina deck card offer stock develop settlement construct track determine action deck pass left action take action card leave deck dividend pay base railroad value total number share new start last time final payoff base value income actual share sell share railroad available money stock purchase go railroad treasury track construction pay railroad treasury track draw pre define route plastic crayon settlement develop fund increase income available railroad money final payoff fourth prairie railroad series

1800;Mythos;"In this card game based in H.P Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, you play an investigator (represented by a double sized card that has your stats, special abilities and keeps your story organized) who must complete stories without going insane.  From a deck of at least 52 cards you draw 13 and take turns playing one at a time so it moves at a brisk pace.  You stock your deck with at least 20 points of stories (usually 3 or 4) and try to get the required cards into play.  As an example The card 'A Day in the Life of a M. U. Student' requires you to visit 3 Different Miskatonic University Locations, cast a spell, summon a monster, go to a country site and play an ally of the opposite sex.  When you have fulfilled the conditions you score the card and gain sanity.  In this card's case you score 8 points and gain 2 sanity.&#10;&#10;The types of cards you have are locations (you almost always occupy one), allies, monsters, events, tomes, spells, artifacts and adventures.  A round lasts until there are two passes, at which time all monsters played fight each other then go after the investigators to disable their allies or reduce their sanity.  You can throw allies in front of the monsters as cannon fodder to protect your investigator.  You then decide what cards you are going to keep in your hand (each investigator has a minimum and a maximum number of cards that must be kept) and draw back to 13 for the next round.  Because of this you blow through your deck very quickly and you will go through it a couple of times in most games.&#10;&#10;There are also some very nasty phobias and events to play on your opponents to interfere with their strategies.  There is a lot of interaction and the Lovecraftian atmosphere is keenly felt.&#10;&#10;";1996;6.65293;2.5556;1;10;45;10;Adventure, Card Game, Collectible Components, Fighting, Horror, Novel-based;card base h p lovecraft cthulhu mythos investigator represent double sized card stat special keep story organize complete story go insane deck card draw time brisk pace stock deck story usually try require card example card day life m u student require visit different miskatonic university location cast spell summon monster country site ally opposite sex fulfil condition card gain sanity card case gain sanity card location occupy ally monster event tomes spell artifact adventure last pass time monster fight investigator disable ally reduce sanity throw ally monster cannon fodder protect investigator decide card go hand investigator minimum maximum number card keep draw blow deck quickly couple time nasty phobia event opponent interfere strategy lot lovecraftian atmosphere keenly feel

1816;Mississippi;"An abstract race game set on the Mississippi river. Each person has a boat (actually a hexagonal piece with the numbers 1-6 written on each of the 6 sides of the piece). The board is a long track of hexes that wind back and forth in an 'S' pattern. Each person places his 'boat' on the start space with one of the numbers facing forwards. Each person also starts with a number of 'Logs'. These are used to move your boat forward 1 space for each log spent. (You can also decide to move backwards - gaining 1 log for each space moved back).&#10;&#10;Now comes the complication - bumping. If your boat stops in a space that is adjacent to 1 or more others, bumping occurs. To determine where your boat ends up you look at the hex sides facing each other (on your boat and on the adjacent one(s)). You subtract the adjacent boat's hex side number from yours - and if it is positive your boat moves forward that number of spaces, and if negative - the other boat moves forward that number of spaces. Now you check to see if your boat is adjacent to another boat and if so repeat the bumping procedure.&#10;&#10;If your boat is next to more than 1 boat, and has at least 1 positive difference, your boat moves forward. If you have more than 1 positive, add them together and move forward that distance. If you have a negative difference the other boats move in clockwise order.&#10;&#10;For subsequent turns - you can freely change the facing (&amp; thus the hex side number facing forward) by 60 degrees. Moving it further than 1 hexside costs you 1 &quot;log&quot; per extra 60 degree facing change. You then decide whether to move forward or back and resolve any bumping.&#10;&#10;The first boat to the finish wins.&#10;&#10;";1987;5.9423;2.1053;2;6;60;10;Abstract Strategy, Nautical, Racing;abstract race set mississippi river person boat actually hexagonal piece number write side piece long track hex wind forth pattern person place boat start space number face forwards person start number log boat forward space log spend decide backwards gain log space come complication bump boat stop space adjacent bump occur determine boat end look hex side face boat adjacent subtract adjacent boat hex number positive boat forward number space negative boat forward number space check boat adjacent boat repeat bumping procedure boat boat positive difference boat forward positive add forward distance negative difference boat clockwise order subsequent freely change face amp hex number face forward degree hexside cost log extra degree face change decide forward resolve bumping boat finish
1820;Z-G;"Z-G is a combination miniatures wargame/collectible card game. The miniatures, which represent arena combat robots, are actually 5&quot; action figures with 14 points of articulation and 8 pieces of removable armor. Each piece of armor has a corresponding collectible card giving its statistics and special powers. Each basic set includes a fixed 10 card set (1 card per piece of equipment, including the figure itself, plus a character card)&#10;&#10;The game is played in rounds, which start with all players choosing which 3 pieces of equipment to use this round. Each piece of equipment also has an impulse rating, and whoever has the highest impulse goes first. Players then use their cards to move their figure a number of card lengths and/or use attacks based on a color-matching system on the ends of each card.

1822;Wilderness War;"Wilderness War is a card-driven wargame, dramatically simpler and more streamlined than either For the People or Paths of Glory, but the complexity still exceeds the classic Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, but only just.&#10;&#10;In Wilderness War, the players get to re-fight the 7 Years War in North America. Although only a single deck of strategy cards is used, &agrave; la We the People, the two sides are dramatically different in character: the French are irregular-heavy (especially Indians) and rely on raiding to tie down the superior numbers of British Regular &amp; Provincial drilled troops, who will themselves be intent on sieges and trying to force a pitched battle. Like Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, the fortunes of war turn as the game goes on: the French are masters early, with the crushing British manpower advantage accruing late.&#10;&#10;Wilderness War takes two players into the French &amp; Indian War, 1755-1760, the climactic struggle between France and Britain for control of North America. It uses strategy cards and a point-to-point map similar to GMT's award winning For the People and Paths of Glory. Players maneuver and fight over a map stretching from Northern Virginia to Canada. As the leader of French or British forces in North America, you will need to defend your frontier, raid your enemy's frontier, build fortification networks through the harsh wilderness, recruit Indian allies, besiege forts and fortresses, and deal with events occurring in Europe that are above and beyond your control.&#10;&#10;Wilderness War includes a deck of strategy cards for conducting campaigns and incorporating the many events and personalities of the war. The French player can recruit up to sixteen different Indian tribes as allies, secure a continental alliance in Europe against Great Britain, sortie his squadron at Louisbourg, force a ministerial crisis in London, and work toward draining support for the war from the provincial assemblies. The British player can recruit Mohawks and Cherokees, plan for and conduct amphibious operations, implement a global strategy via William Pitt, destroy the French fleet at Quiberon Bay, and expel the Acadians. Relive the history of this exciting time when the fate of Canada hung in the balance.&#10;&#10;Wilderness War is by the designer of the more recent Labyrinth: The War on Terror, 2001 &#226;&#128;&#147; ? and Andean Abyss and other Series: COIN (GMT) games.&#10;&#10;";2001;7.69922;3.307;1;2;180;12;Age of Reason, American Indian Wars, Wargame;wilderness war card drive wargame dramatically simple streamlined people path glory complexity exceed classic hannibal rome vs carthage wilderness war fight year war north america single deck strategy card agrave la people side dramatically different character french irregular heavy especially indians rely raid tie superior number british regular amp provincial drill troop intent siege try force pitched battle like hannibal rome vs carthage fortune war go french master early crush british manpower advantage accrue late wilderness war take french amp indian war climactic struggle france britain north america use strategy card map similar gmt award people path glory maneuver fight map stretch northern virginia canada leader french british force north america need defend frontier raid enemy frontier build fortification network harsh wilderness recruit indian ally besiege fort fortress deal event occur europe wilderness war include deck strategy card conduct campaign incorporate event personality war french recruit sixteen different indian tribe ally secure continental alliance europe great britain sortie squadron louisbourg force ministerial crisis london work drain support war provincial assembly british recruit mohawk cherokee plan conduct amphibious operation implement global strategy william pitt destroy french fleet quiberon bay expel acadian relive history exciting time fate canada hang balance wilderness war designer recent labyrinth war terror andean abyss series coin gmt games
1824;Trump: The Game;"In Trump: the Game players compete in two parts.  In the first part, players circle the board, feeding money into the eight available properties, then bidding on those properties (not being able to see how much the property is worth) and collecting &quot;Trump&quot; cards.  When all the properties are gone, the negotiation phase begins.  Players use their Trump cards to buy and sell properties, some cards award huge payoffs for specific sets.  After each player has passed their turn, the property values are revealed, and the player with the most money wins (usually in the $400-$600M range).&#10;&#10;";1989;4.33313;1.6591;3;4;45;12;Economic, Memory, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Negotiation;trump compete part circle feed money available property bid property able property worth collect trump card property go negotiation begin use trump card buy sell property card award huge payoff specific set pass property value reveal money usually m range

1828;Doomsday Cult 2000;"In Doomsday Cult 2000, players take the role of cult leaders bent on bringing about the end of the world.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player secretly chooses a Doomsday date in the month of December, 1999 (play commences on December 1st, and each turn is one day long). From there, play mechanics are reminiscent of Steve Jackson's Illuminati: cards representing potential cult members (a/k/a Sheep) are dealt into a common pool in the middle of the table. Players in their turn use Influence to recruit Sheep for their Flock (cult); each new Sheep you control adds to your Influence, and many of them grant special abilities as well. In addition to recruiting uncontrolled Sheep, you can also try to convert (steal) or &quot;deprogram&quot; (make uncontrolled) Sheep belonging to other players' Flocks, or declare jihad and have one of your Sheep making a suicide attack on one of your rivals' Sheep.&#10;&#10;When your chosen Doomsday comes around, all of the Sheep you currently control commit ritual mass suicide in an attempt to trigger the apocalypse. A die roll determines whether they succeed; the more Sheep you sacrifice, the better the odds. If you do successfully end the world, you win; if you fail, you pick a new Doomsday and start gathering a Flock again; if the world hasn't ended by January 1st, 2000, everybody loses.&#10;&#10;The game is DTP quality, with the cards laser-printed on (pre-cut) heavy marbled paper.&#10;&#10;";1998;0.0;0.0;2;6;30;10;Card Game;doomsday cult role cult leader bent bring end world beginning secretly choose doomsday date month december commence december st day long reminiscent steve jackson illuminati card represent potential cult member k sheep deal common pool middle table use influence recruit sheep flock cult new sheep add influence grant special addition recruit uncontrolled sheep try convert steal deprogram uncontrolled sheep belong flock declare jihad sheep make suicide attack rival sheep choose doomsday come sheep currently commit ritual mass suicide attempt trigger apocalypse die determine succeed sheep sacrifice well odd successfully end world fail pick new doomsday start gather flock world hasn t end january st everybody dtp quality card laser print pre cut heavy marbled paper

Only Britain still stands, isolated and defiant, readying itself for a mortal struggle between the Luftwaffe and the Royal Air Force. For the first time in history, air power will decide the fate of a nation.&#10;&#10;August 1940: The Royal Air Force has been awaiting massive German air raids since Churchill refused to make peace with Germany. And they did not have to wait long - in fact, far too short to build up the RAF to a strength that would be able to match the German Luftwaffe. But besides its fighters, the RAF has other weapons to help deal with the &quot;Huns&quot;: a chain of RDF (radar) towers along the British coast, and an elaborate system of communications, signal evaluation and fighter control and guidance. If those are used skilfully, the resulting economy of Fighter Command operations might just be able to offset the sheer power of the German Luftflotten (&quot;air fleets&quot;).&#10;&#10;You are in command of all four RAF Fighter Groups to match them against the incoming raids.

1868;Conquistador;"A simple card game of empire-building rivalry.&#10;&#10;There are some 15 territory cards rated 1 through 3, some of which are dealt out to the players at the start (each gets a 1 and a 2 territory).  There are Revolt and Cannon cards.  The remaining cards are Development cards, each rated from 1 to 6.  On your turn, you draw a card and play or discard one.  The deck of a little over a hundred cards is played through and then everyone scores.  Once the deck is exhausted, play continues until everyone's hand is also exhausted.  Once your hand drops below four cards, there are some limitations on card play that come into effect.&#10;&#10;When developing a Territory you own, you ideally would play a 1, then a 2, and so on up to a 6.  The developments must be played in increasing numerical sequence, but they need not be consecutive.  At the end of the game, a territory scores the number of development cards on it times its basic multiplier (1&times;, 2&times; or 3&times;) - so an undeveloped territory is worthless.  If you managed to have a sequence of at least four consecutive developments on the territory, you score a sizable bonus.&#10;&#10;Revolt cards prevent a territory from being developed or attacked; they also cancel an existing revolt card (there are only 8 of those in the deck).  It is sometimes good strategy to play a revolt on a territory of your own to prevent it from being attacked.&#10;&#10;Cannon cards are used to attack other players' territories; you play a cannon face down, and so does the defender.  Both reveal their cards and add a die roll.  The attacker's total must beat the defender's for the attack to succeed.  When it does, you roll a die and this indicates how many cards you plunder from that territory.  If that roll is high enough, you can even steal the territory itself.  Plundered cards must be allocated to your territories right away or discarded.&#10;&#10;Cannon can also be used, if rated four or better, to empty one of your territories from its development cards so as to redeploy them - in effect, you are raiding yourself.&#10;&#10;A number of small variant rules are supplied in the rule book.  The cards are printed in French, English and Dutch.&#10;&#10;It is good strategy to build your hand for the end game, so you can, for example, protect a territory with a Revolt, then unprotect it, redeploy Development cards with a strong Cannon, and complete the territory's development with your last few card plays.&#10;&#10;Awards&#10;&#10;Card Game As d&#039;Or 2001&#10;&#10;";2001;5.0;2.25;2;4;60;8;Card Game, Economic, Renaissance;simple card empire building rivalry territory card rate deal start get territory revolt cannon card remain card development card rate draw card discard deck little card deck exhausted continue hand exhaust hand drop card limitation card come effect develop territory ideally development increase numerical sequence need consecutive end territory number development card time basic multipli time time time undeveloped territory worthless manage sequence consecutive development territory sizable bonus revolt card prevent territory develop attack cancel exist revolt card deck good strategy revolt territory prevent attack cannon card attack territory cannon face defender reveal card add die attacker total beat defender attack succeed die indicate card plunder territory high steal territory plunder card allocate territory right away discard cannon rate well territory development card redeploy effect raid number small supply book card print french english dutch good strategy build hand end example protect territory revolt unprotect redeploy development card strong cannon complete territory development card award card d
1870;Gold Train;"Frontier discovery, labor shortages and gold mines are the focus of Gold Train.  This game forces difficult decisions and often unpleasant player interaction.  Set in the Old West of the USA.&#10;&#10;The game board is constructed by the players at the start of the game.  During the setup, initial terrain tiles are placed (mostly face down) starting at the center of the board and moving out in rings (similar to Twilight Imperium: Third Edition).  Only a portion of the tiles are uncovered at the start and the board is different every game.&#10;&#10;Players bid for starting areas and play begins.  &#10;Players search (or discover) terrain (similar to the search process used in 2038: Tycoons of the Asteroid Belt).  This phase also allows players to apply various counters that affect terrain (help themselves or hurt other players) and to discover mines.&#10;Then players use labor that they have procured to build tracks.&#10;Finally, players get paid.  If a player has track to a mine, the railroad services the mine and collects income.  Coal mines pay the least and Gold mines pay the most.&#10;&#10;But watch out for the Dalton Boys or the Clinton gang.&#10;&#10;";2000;5.08824;2.0;2;6;120;12;American West, Economic, Trains, Transportation;frontier discovery labor shortage gold mine focus gold train force difficult decision unpleasant set old west usa construct start initial terrain tile place face start center ring similar twilight imperium portion tile uncover start different bid start area begin search discover terrain similar search process tycoon asteroid belt allow apply affect terrain help hurt discover mine use labor procure build track finally pay track railroad service collect income coal mine pay gold mine pay watch dalton boy clinton gang

They must buy insurance and take advantage of opportunities to prepare their resorts, or face the imminent threat of the hurricane!  There are many different hurricane tracks based on real historical data, which are written on hurricane program cards that are moved through a sleeve.

1894;War Galley: Naval Warfare in the Ancient World;"(from GMT website):&#10;&#10;War Galley is the seventh volume in the multi-award winning Great Battles of History (GBoH) series, but the first to venture entirely into the waters of the Mediterranean Sea. It is also the first historical boardgame published, in two decades, to address galley warfare. As such, GMT's War Galley is almost a complete history for this era of war at sea.&#10;&#10;What is best about War Galley is how easy it is to play -- the rules are about half the length of the usual GBoH game -- and that means that most battles can be complete in several hours, at the most. The battles themselves, cover all aspects of galley tactics, from the line against line of big ships at Salamis (Cyprus), to the Chase, Turn and Fight of Chios, to the Line Astern vs. Line Abreast at Side, to probably the most unusual of all ancient battles, the Roman arrowhead against the Carthaginian Lines Astern at Drepanum in 249 B.C.&#10;&#10;War Galley wars and battles covered by the scenarios are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Ionian Revolt- Lade, 494 BC&#10;     Peloponnesian War- Arginusae, 406 BC&#10;     The Silician Wars- Catana, 397 BC&#10;     The First Successor War- Salamis, 306 BC (Cyprus)&#10;     The First Punic War&#10;         Ecnomus, 256 BC&#10;         Drepanum, 249 BC&#10;         Aegatian Islands, 242 BC &#10;    &#10;     The Macedonian Wars- Chios, 201 BC&#10;     The War with Antiochus&#10;         Side, 190 BC&#10;         Myonessus, 190 BC &#10;    &#10;     The Civil War&#10;         Tauris, 47 BC&#10;         Naulochus, 36 BC&#10;         Actium, 31 BC &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;";1999;7.10933;3.125;1;2;360;14;Ancient, Nautical, Wargame;gmt website war galley seventh volume multi award great battle history gboh series venture entirely water mediterranean sea historical boardgame publish decade address galley warfare gmt war galley complete history era war sea good war galley easy half length usual gboh mean battle complete hour battle cover aspect galley tactic line line big ship salamis cyprus chase fight chio line astern vs line abreast probably unusual ancient battle roman arrowhead carthaginian line astern drepanum b c war galley war battle cover ionian revolt lade bc peloponnesian war arginusae bc silician war catana bc successor war salamis bc cyprus punic war ecnomus bc drepanum bc aegatian island bc macedonian war chio bc war antiochu bc myonessus bc civil war tauris bc naulochus bc actium bc

1912;World Cup Tournament Football;"This is really a card game disguised in a rather large box. The object of the game is to get your team through the qualifying for the (soccer) World Cup, and hopefully win.&#10;&#10;The game has a board which depicts a a bunch of soccer fields - just placeholders for the cards played in the &#10;tournament: from 16 fields for the first elimination round and the 8 fields for the round of 16, up to the one field used for the finals. There is also a deck of cards for each of the teams involved in the game with two sets of numbers printed on the card depicting the number of goals scored and the number of penalties given to that team. Finally there are counters depicting the 32 teams in the tournament.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with five random cards and the team counters are randomly distributed to each of the players (showing which team each player will 'manage'). Each team is rated either as 0, 1, or 2 - this is the 'bonus' number of goals that team will score in each match it plays.&#10;&#10;Each player in turn can play a card onto any soccer field. On the preliminary matches (fields), the cards are placed face-up (maximum of 3 cards), on any other field, the card is placed face-down. Once all the fields are full, the matches are resolved with the winner of the match going on to the next. Once the preliminary matches are resolved and the teams determined for the next round, those cards are flipped over and the results determined. This is done all the way to the finals.&#10;&#10;A player can determine where his team will end up playing each subsequent match and play cards face-down to try to get his team to win, but if your team is upset early - all those face-down cards that you played are now going to help some other team and not yours.&#10;&#10;";1993;6.37727;1.6667;2;10;60;10;Bluffing, Card Game, Sports;card disguise large box object team qualifying soccer world cup hopefully depict bunch soccer field placeholder card tournament field elimination field field final deck card team involve set number print card depict number number penalty give team finally depict team tournament start random card team randomly distribute show team manage team rate bonus number team match card soccer field preliminary match field card place face maximum card field card place face field match resolve winner match go preliminary match resolve team determine card result determine way final determine team end subsequent match card face try team team upset early face card go help team

(Partners are not the fellow players at the table - but the chosen partner card of the same color as the wooden piece).&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt 12 sympathy cards. These cards are played on your turn and are used to move or exchange a partner figure. There are 3 different types of sympathy cards: the cards with the numbers are used to move the corresponding colord figure on the board; the cards with an arrow moves the corresponding piece forward to the space of another playing piece; finally the cards with the text are played and the actions carried out immediately.  Alternatively, each numbered or arrowed sympathy card can be used to exchange partner cards with another player.&#10;&#10;The game starts with a player playing a numbered Sympathy Card and moving the corresponding piece forward that number of spaces, then drawing a new card.

1920;The Business Game;"Board of two joined leaves, 12 mine derricks (2 of each of 6 colours), 6 lorries [trucks], 5 barges, 2 ships, 90 pyramids (15 of each of 6 colours), 24 cubes (4 of each of 6 colours), 26 production cards, 6 Canal Company Title Deeds, 2 production debit cards, 1 die, sterling and dollar currency.&#10;&#10;The players are operating a mine and trying to get the ore to market, but must compete with each other for the limited transportation resources.  The ore has to be transported initially by lorries and also later by barges to the coastal warehouse.  All transport has to be hired and there is always less transport available than required, favouring those who are prepared to take a risk on achieving a quick journey without mishap.  For example there are only 5 barges (always one less than the numbers of players) to encourage competition and load sharing.  You can also force other players to pay you for taking their ore to make up a barge load as all barges have to travel fully laden.  Much depends on how long a journey takes.  New ore can only be obtained by throwing a 1 or a six which also triggers the playing of a production card which can be favourable or not.&#10;&#10;From the coastal warehouse, barges and ships are used to transport ore out to sea to foreign ports to sell to gradually earn the Million Dollars needed to win the game.

1924;Maloney's Inheritance;"Players are traveling from city-to-city with a single car.  All players have a goal to reach a different city at a certain time in order to maximize points.  As each player has a different set of goals, some players will benefit while others will lose out.&#10;&#10;On each turn, the control of the car will be auctioned. After the auction round, the winner pays the bank and chooses the destination for the car.&#10;&#10;Upon arrival at a city, the driver receives that city's suitcase. This suitcase can indicate that the driver receives up to five points or $1,500.  It may also say that he loses up to three points or $1,000.&#10;&#10;Additionally, upon arriving in a city, players may play action cards that correspond to the city. Points are awarded depending on the day of the week of the arrival.  Tuesdays and Fridays you receive double points.&#10;&#10;The game ends either when a player has received 69 points or when a player is out of action cards.

An &quot;Arms Spiral&quot; is in the middle of the board, representing the arms race.  When the &quot;BOMB&quot; arrives at the end of the Arms Spiral, world peace is over and everyone has lost!  However, if all players work together in such a way that one reaches the &quot;World Peace&quot; space, then the arms race is over.

1932;Anti-Monopoly II;"(Note: Not to be confused with the original Anti-Monopoly, even though recent versions of Anti-Monopoly II are called simply &quot;Anti-Monopoly&quot;. As for the reasons why this is so, please see the clarifications at the end of this article and the article of Anti-Monopoly.)&#10;&#10;In this game the players follow either the rules for Monopolists or those for Competitors. Competitors charge fair rents, build as soon as they own a property, place four houses (green) at the most, after which they build a hotel (red) and occasionally go to Price War. On the other hand, Monopolists extort monopoly-high rents from their poor tenants, build only after they have at least two streets of one color, restrict supply by putting only three houses on their properties, after which they also are allowed to build a hotel (red) and occasionally go to prison!&#10;&#10;The good guys are the small entrepreneurs and the bad guys are the monopolists. Since players do not play by the same rules, fairness is achieved by a win probability equalization technique (which is where the second author comes in).&#10;&#10;Competitors make more money than Monopolists in the beginning of the game but Monopolists can catch up later, especially if Competitors don't watch their money!&#10;&#10;The game was first published as &quot;Choice&quot; because Anspach was forbidden to use the word &quot;Monopoly&quot; by the courts. When that was overturned in 1983, the name was changed to &quot;Anti-Monopoly II&quot;. In 1987, believing that consumer confusion between Anti-Monopoly and Anti-Monopoly II was harming sales of the latter game, Anspach ceased the production of the original game and removed the &quot;II&quot; from the name of the latter game.&#10;&#10;";1977;3.74221;1.5;2;6;120;8;Economic;note confuse original anti monopoly recent anti monopoly ii call simply anti monopoly reason clarification end article article anti monopoly follow monopolist competitor competitor charge fair rent build soon property place house green build hotel red occasionally price war hand monopolist extort monopoly high rent poor tenant build street color restrict supply put house property allow build hotel red occasionally prison good guy small entrepreneur bad guy monopolist fairness achieve probability equalization technique second author come competitor money monopolist beginning monopolist catch later especially competitor don t watch money publish anspach forbid use word monopoly court overturn change anti monopoly ii believe consumer confusion anti monopoly anti monopoly ii harm sale anspach cease production original remove ii

If there are fewer players, specific cards are removed. Each player is dealt 12 cards.&#10;&#10;The start player calls a colour. Each player puts a  card in front of him/herself, face down. If you have a card of the called colour, you have to put down a card of that colour. If not, you can choose any of your cards.&#10;&#10;When all players have put down a card, each player decides if he/she wants to reveal his/her card, starting with the start player. You can only reveal your card if it is of the colour that was called. But if you have played a card in the called colour, you can choose to pretend you didn't and thus don't reveal your card.&#10;&#10;If nobody reveals a card, the caller stays in control.

1952;Long Short;"The game board shows price charts/tables for 6 commodities 2 each of 3 different price levels.  Every player id dealt 10 commodity cards which change the price up or down of one or more of the commodities.  Every player starts with $10,000 and the winner is the player who has the most money after everyone has played all ten of their cards.&#10;&#10;On a players turn they can: 1 - enter or close out a contract (going either long - betting the price will go up; or short - betting the price will go down; 2-  play a price movement card; 3 - roll the dice (usually either resulting in a commodity price movement or an action card draw (random event)).&#10;&#10;The nature of the futures market is that you take positions based on whether you believe a commodity price will go up or down.  If you think the price will rise, you buy or go 'long' of the commodity hoping that by the time the contract matures, you can sell them back at a profit. Conversely, if your hunch (or information) is that prices will fall, you sell or go 'short' thinking you can close out the deal at a lower price, again making money. So the logic is that whatever way the market moves, you can make profits - if you are right.    The one thing that this game does is give each person at least one chance to sell a contract at any time - not just on your turn - so if you think it is the perfect time - you can interrupt another player's turn to sell to lock in your profits.&#10;&#10;The game is over after everyone plays their last card - and no new contracts can be started during the last round (1 card left).  There is still quite a bit of luck in the game,  with wild swings possible in some commodity prices, but you start with all the cards you will have and therefore have a good bit of information about some price swing possibilities - all you need is some help and a bit of help from the random events.&#10;&#10;";1982;6.31531;1.75;2;6;60;12;Bluffing, Economic;show price chart table commodity different price d deal commodity card change price commodity start winner money card enter close contract going long bet price short bet price price card dice usually result commodity price action card draw random event nature future market position base believe commodity price think price rise buy long commodity hope time contract mature sell profit conversely hunch information price fall sell short thinking close deal low price make money logic way market profit right thing person chance sell contract time think perfect time interrupt sell lock profit card new contract start card leave bit luck wild swing possible commodity price start card good bit information price swing possibility need help bit help random event

1958;The Game of Nations;"This game is a geopolitical simulation of local influence in the Middle East on the flow of oil supplies to the rest of the world.&#10;&#10;The map shows 8 fictitious Middle Eastern oil producing countries, one of which controls the Canal that links both ocean sides. If your superpower is on one ocean and you try to obtain oil from a country bordering on the other ocean, the Canal becomes of vital strategic importance. The alternative is to connect that country to another on the &quot;correct&quot; side of the board (through the land-locked middle countries, which are also bigger producers) with a series of pipelines. To move oil you must, of course, have a friendly leader in place at the head of that country.&#10;&#10;You start with a leader of your color on the capital of a country and one tanker that can transport oil from that country's port to your country. To reflect a level of organisation, oil is worth more per shipping if a king or politician is in place than a dictator or guerrilla, whose job is more offensive. You spend money to move leader pieces about the board, with the managing pieces costing more than the offensive pieces. Secret agents also move each turn and are used to defend attacks by blocking the path of opposing leaders and for moving onto &quot;?&quot; spaces to take a gamble on an incident card. At face value, half the cards are favourable and half not, but all offer diplomatic opportunities for the country who is most stable.&#10;&#10;To survive players must continually manage risks while trying to maximize their oil revenue. Early bold attacks, even combined with the right incident card, are not recommended: a co-operative approach to the game maximises revenue to offset the many accidents which can happen in the game.&#10;&#10;From the Waddington ad for the game dated 1972:&#10;&#10;A political strategy game&#10;&quot;In the modern world of international diplomacy and intrigue, there are many stakes in this game of economic survival.

1964;Campaign;"Not to be confused with Campaign, the identically named game produced by Wills and Hepworth in the 1940's.&#10;&#10;&quot;An exciting strategy game in which each player can become a Napoleon or a Wellington leading his army across Europe.  Famous battles can be re-fought and alliances can be made and broken with this compelling game of military and political strategy&quot;&#10;&#10;Large playing board in three sections, four sets of army pieces in red, white, blue and light green, comprising 1 General, 9 infantry and 9 cavalry units.  Six sets of 4 town cards of different colors, 4 alliance cards, 2 dice, 6 page rule book, and a 4 page &quot;The Years of Napoleon&quot; historical booklet.&#10;&#10;The game reproduces the Napoleonic wars at the strategic level in a very abstract fashion (all players are equal).  It can be won either by the outright defeat of your opponent, or (more likely) by acquiring towns controlling large areas of territory.  The board is an abstract representation of Europe and western Russia and is divided into six areas of roughly equal size representing France, Prussia, Russia, Austria, Italy and Spain.&#10;&#10;Each country has four provincial towns, and five of the countries used as starting countries also have a capital city.  Parts of the board, particularly the central area, have areas of impenetrable mountains, forests, and sea which restrict the movement of the troops.&#10;&#10;There are introductory and standard rules.  Normally, each player selects a country, but in the two player game each gets two countries except that the France + Prussia combo is not allowed.&#10;&#10;The pieces move using the dice, and combat is deterministic.  The throw can be used all on one piece or many pieces.  The full throw does not have to be used.  The pieces are placed in a set format on the country selected, with the General on the capital square and four infanty and four cavalry. The town cards are used to keep track of who controls what.&#10;&#10;The pieces move in set ways. The General moves one square in any direction. When it attacks it has a value of one and when defending a value of two. The General must be present to take a town.  Cavalry moves two squares at a time and must move horizontally or vertically but never diagonally.  Infantry moves one square and only diagonally.  Pieces cannot pass through opposing lines unless there is a clear gap of at least one square.&#10;&#10;Combat is like movement: one considers which pieces could be moved to the target piece's square and totals up the combat value --if large enough, the opposing piece is removed.  Only one piece can be attacked in a turn.  In the standard game, adjacent pieces also support each other (in a manner reminiscent of Diplomacy), which introduces a fair amount of tactics in on-going battles.&#10;&#10;Lost pieces are regenerated in your country's mustering area, forcing you to keep a constant flow of recruits towards the front.  In the standard game, the towns also represent logistical support --lose the town and you lose the corresponding piece.&#10;&#10;The odd movement system means you actually have two sets of cavalry and infantry pieces on the board, each set (which we could call &quot;odd&quot; and &quot;even&quot;) being unable to assist the other.&#10;&#10;A capital can only be captured after the provincial towns have been captured.  Where more than two players are playing you can agree to ally with another player and exchange alliance cards as reminders.  An ally cannot cross into his ally's territory without his consent.  Alliances can be broken simply by announcing the fact; you can attack your former ally on your next turn only, giving him a turn to re-deploy.&#10;&#10;The game is won if the player captures all his opponents capitals or captures 8 towns of any colour but not including the 4 in his own country.  You also win if your opponent's General is left with no troops.&#10;&#10;Campaign is basically a pure strategy game.  It you are in a position to attack a piece, you will take it.  However, there is some luck depending on how high a movement throw you have.&#10;&#10;from the Waddington ad for the game from 1976:   &quot;This absorbing strategy game captures the tension and the pressures of the famous Napoleonc battles.

The highest card in the color led wins the trick, and that player leads the next trick.

1987;Emperor of China;"In this highly abstract strategic wargame, you are trying to conquer China by being the first to occupy fifteen provinces at the completion of a complete round of play (all players having had an equal number of turns).  Alternatively, the game can be timed and scored.&#10;&#10;You start with a small number of provinces under your control.  Population counters of your colour indicate this; if a province has extra population, it can move some into an adjacent unoccupied province --this is the simplest way of conquest.  Merger, diplomacy and force (Risk-like combat) are your other options.  Each turn you draw a Yin card and a Yang card.  Yin is bad, Yang is good.  Without looking at either card's instructions, you assign them to two of your provinces.  Yang will most likely increase your recruitment (which is normally three population per turn), but could also give you the capability to cross a natural barrier like a mountain range.  Yin will hurt you.  Some cards you end up holding in your hand.&#10;&#10;A player may attempt to convince another player to merge with his empire.  If the second player agrees then the smaller empire is absorbed by the larger and both players continue play as senior (larger) and junior (smaller) partners.  The absorbed empire no longer has a separate turn nor separate recruitment.  This concept of &quot;shared victory&quot; is intriguing, particularly with a larger number of players.&#10;&#10;The game allows any number of players but components are only provided for five.&#10;&#10;";1972;5.98644;2.0476;2;5;60;10;Ancient, Negotiation, Wargame;highly abstract strategic wargame try conquer china occupy province completion complete having equal number alternatively time start small number province population colour indicate province extra population adjacent unoccupied province simple way conquest merger diplomacy force risk like combat option draw yin card yang card yin bad yang good look card instruction assign province yang likely increase recruitment normally population capability cross natural barrier like mountain range yin hurt card end hold hand attempt convince merge empire second agree small empire absorb large continue senior large junior small partner absorbed empire long separate separate recruitment concept share intriguing particularly large number allow number component provide

1989;The Peter Principle Game;"This game was published in the wake of the best-selling success of Dr. Peter's book &quot;The Peter Principle&quot; (oft-quoted as &quot;In a hierarchy, every employee tends to rise to his or her level of incompetence&quot;). In it, the players, employees of a huge corporation, compete to avoid promotion and remain competent (by taking more &quot;right&quot; decisions than &quot;wrong&quot; ones). At the same time, each tries to force the others into promotion or into &quot;deadwood&quot; status (which happens by accumulating enough wrong decisions and being found out). The last player still alive and competent is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;The game was originally published by Skor-Mor in 1973, but the 1981 AH edition is much easier to find.&#10;&#10;Skor-Mor published 3D puzzles and games in clear plastic such as Chess in the Third Dimension and a 3D Tic-Tac-Toe called Trinary.

Going separately increases the benefits when they happen, but makes it a lot harder to survive the bad turns of events.

Where will the thief strike next?  You and your opponents are licensed private detectives.  The thief you&rsquo;re after is computer controlled and completely invisible.  But you can hear him!  With your ELECTRONIC CRIME SCANNER you can eavesdrop on the thief whenever he moves on the board.  You can hear him in the act of committing a crime.  You hear him, too, as he opens a door, crosses a floor, breaks a window, runs on the street and escapes on the subway.  Each sound you hear is a clue that will help you track him down.  You&rsquo;ll need all your skills of deduction and logic to follow the thief and corner him.  Then you can call the police.  With luck, the police will arrest the thief and cart him off to jail.  Sometimes, though, he escapes from them.  At other times, he&rsquo;s just not where you think he is!  If you can catch this thief, you&rsquo;ll earn a large reward.

1993;Troke;"The sub-title for Troke is &quot;Castle Checkers&quot;.&#10;&#10;Abstract strategy game where players move three different kinds of pieces (tower, wall, and moat) across a board diagonally forward, straight ahead or sideways, but never backwards.  In some versions of the game, points are scored for capturing opponent's pieces and by forming complete &quot;castles&quot; (a tower, wall, and moat) on the player's goal line.  Otherwise it is a race to see who can get all their pieces to goal line. A feature of the game is that if you merge with one or two different pieces you take one or two extra moves.  You are allowed to merge (capture) with opponent&rsquo;s pieces and thus move them away from their goal and towards your own. Making moves becomes complicated as the game progresses because capturing pieces requires that additional moves be made. If these extra moves can not be made, then the original capture move can not be made.&#10;&#10;";1956;6.10313;2.125;2;4;30;10;Abstract Strategy;sub title troke castle checker abstract strategy different kind piece tower wall moat diagonally forward straight ahead sideways backwards capture opponent piece form complete castle tower wall moat line race piece line merge different piece extra allow merge capture opponent rsquo piece away make complicated progress capture piece require additional extra original capture

1996;Face Off;"A slapstick game of hockey management (endorsed by Howie Meeker, a Canadian hockey personality of the time).&#10;&#10;Everybody knows that professional hockey game is won or lost on the ice, right?  Wrong.  The game that starts when the referee's whistle sounds is only half the story.  See that character on the end clutching the bankroll?  He's the team manager.  What you don't get to see is the game HE plays-and it's every bit as tough as the one on the ice.  Now's your chance to get the inside story.  In Face Off, you manage your own hockey franchise.  That means you have to scramble for league Superstars, trade players, and try to put together the strongest team you can --without running out of cash.  It means you have to cope with temperamental players, broken contracts, and unexpected expenses.&#10;&#10;Of course, you get to manage your team through a season of hockey games, to see how your planning and conniving pays off!  And who wins the playoffs?  Usually the strongest team --but it's up to you to make it that way.&#10;&#10;This game deserves to be better known; the theme is rather under-exploited and Waddingtons' treatment hits just the right tongue-in-cheek note here.

Four news stories are missing on each newspaper front page and it is up to the players to get them.&#10;&#10;The game board, which is divided into 10x16 squares, shows a map of the world. Each player has four reporters that he can move around the world searching for news stories.&#10;&#10;Central in the game mechanics is a telex, which tells the players where to go finding stories. The player rolls the die and then turns the telex as many messages back or forth as the die roll shows. The telex will now show one or two messages from one or two cities, for example: &quot;Jalta - Crime&quot;. The player then rolls the die once more and tries to get one of his reporters to Jalta. If he succeeds in this then he might draw a news card and if the card has a news report of the same category as the message on the telex (i.e, crime), then he might place this card on one of the blank spaces on his front page.&#10;&#10;Winner is the player who first fills up all the blank spaces on his front page.&#10;&#10;";1976;3.99375;1.0;2;4;45;8;Children's Game, Travel;position reporter newspaper news story miss newspaper page divide x square show map world reporter world search news story central telex tell find story die telex message forth die show telex message city example jalta crime die try reporter jalta succeed draw news card card news report category message telex e crime place card blank space page winner fill blank space page

2045;Nomad;"(From The Rule Book Introduction)&#10;This is the lay of the land.&#10;&#10;This is the nature of the people who reside upon it.&#10;&#10;In the mountains live the people called the Neemahk. Who wear the thick woolly skins of the tiger and mammoth, and carry spears tipped with sharp, shiny, black rock. They are fierce warriors. But even better hunters.&#10;&#10;A day's journey downriver, at the edge of the forest there, live the men who call themselves the Treg. They have learned to reap the bounties of the water. They harvest&#10;the river with nets woven of soft, pliable reeds and roots; and make stories out of symbols painted on hides.&#10;&#10;On the broad open plains to the south live the Marmar. Who plant seeds, and raise animals for work and food. They are a peaceful people, desiring only to be left alone. And the strong walls they have built around their village do much to help them maintain their solitude.&#10;&#10;Lastly are the Dermen, who are a tribe of raiders. They know the land well, being so traveled -- getting direction from the patterns in the stars. They go wherever the warmth of the sun and the wealth of nature lead them. And if they cannot find food enough for themselves, they simply take it... from others.&#10;&#10;Welcome to the World of Nomad...&#10;&#10;Nomad is a game based on the life and times of the early tribal societies at the dawning of the Neolithic Age.

2061;A Line in the Sand;"This is a game detailing the Persian Gulf War fought in the early 1990's. Many of the mechanics are similar to that of one of TSR's other wargames (Red Storm Rising) so players of that game can rather easily go to this game.&#10;&#10;Two versions of this game are played. With less than 5 players, the game is a &quot;Basic Game&quot; where military might is what wins the game. Players take sides, usually a combination of Middle Eastern nations plus the US. In the two player version, for instance, it is (quite predictably) the US &amp; Allies vs. Iraq; in the three-player game &quot;Holy War&quot;, it's Israel vs. Iraq (and Yemen and Jordan) vs. Saudi Arabia (and Syria, Libya, and Lebanon), and so on.&#10;&#10;Combat rules are rather straightforward, and wargamers will be familiar with many of the mechanics. Land (w/ infantry, Iraqi National Guard, and tanks), sea, and air units are all utilized. Most units can take a few hits before removed from the board.&#10;&#10;The *real* game, though, is the six-player diplomatic game. The players are now clearly defined: The US (NATO), Iran, Israel, Iraq/Yemen, Moderate Arabs (Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Kuwait, etc.), and Volatile Arabs (Jordan, Libya, etc.) This adds a crucial element of diplomacy and politics, and makes the game much more interesting than the normal wargaming stuff. A &quot;War Fever&quot; and &quot;Jihad&quot; marker change as nations do things--for instance, the first time a US unit is attacked outside of Turkey, War Fever &quot;tripwires&quot; to 10. If Israel attacks a neighbor, Jihad increases by 2. War Fever and Jihad permit certain things to happen--for instance, if War Fever gets too low, the US is restricted in whom they may attack. If Jihad hits either 1 or 10, revolutions may occur--which can switch entire nations to another player!&#10;&#10;Messages can be sent to other players via a diplomatic pouch--you cannot simply pull another player to the side and whisper in their ear. All messages, once read, go into a big pouch, and players can make diplomatic gestures to read some of the messages after they're read.&#10;&#10;Victory occurs, in any case, when you meet objectives, which can vary from player to player. &quot;War Aim&quot; chits are drawn before the game begins, and so players are not quite certain as to exactly what other players are going for. For Instance, Iraq may win if they capture and hold Kuwait for the last three turns; if Jihad has reached 10 at least once and 10 non-Muslim units have been destroyed (by anyone); or by controlling three more oil fields than they started with. It all depends on what they looked for.&#10;&#10;All in all, the Diplomatic game changes the basic game so much that political considerations are as important as military ones.&#10;&#10;A simplified version of the game with the same name appeared in the TSR comic Warhawks #3. Advanced scenarions for the game in the comic appeared in Warhawks #4.&#10;&#10;";1991;5.97215;2.7667;2;6;180;10;Modern Warfare, Political, Wargame;detail persian gulf war fight early similar tsr wargame red storm rise easily basic military side usually combination middle eastern nation plus instance predictably amp ally vs iraq holy war israel vs iraq yemen jordan vs saudi arabia syria libya lebanon combat straightforward wargamer familiar land w infantry iraqi national guard tank sea air unit utilize unit hit remove real diplomatic clearly define nato iran israel iraq yemen moderate arabs saudi arabia egypt kuwait etc volatile arabs jordan libya etc add crucial element diplomacy politic make interesting normal wargaming stuff war fever jihad marker change nation thing instance time unit attack outside turkey war fever tripwire israel attack neighbor jihad increase war fever jihad permit certain thing happen instance war fever get low restrict attack jihad hit revolution occur switch entire nation message send diplomatic pouch simply pull whisper ear message read big pouch diplomatic gesture read message read occur case meet vary war aim chit draw begin certain exactly go instance iraq capture hold kuwait jihad reach non muslim unit destroy oil field start depend look diplomatic change basic political consideration important military one simplified appear tsr comic warhawks advanced scenarion comic appear warhawks
2063;The Great Khan Game;"The Great Khan Game includes one 32-page rule book, one 11&quot; x 17&quot; full-color map of the Whamite Isles, 120 die-cut cardboard playing pieces, 162 playing cards, and one plastic storage bag.&#10;&#10;This is a card/strategy board game for 2 or more players.  The game is set in the Whamite Islands.  It is a very fun game, which usually lasts an hour or so depending on the number players and chance.&#10;&#10;The idea of the game is to make as much gold as possible by controlling countries within your own little empire from the dozen or so provinces available.  The game uses a card system with a lot of clever design tricks added on to provide depth.&#10;&#10;The game play within your turn is easy to pick up, but requires much thought to get right. You are dealt six cards initially, which will usually give you weak control of a couple of countries. These can be added to each turn by drawing two free cards or taking the top card from the discard pile. Additionally, you can buy extra cards every turn.  Having checked the cards for events and acted on those immediately, you can make 'melds,' war and political manoeuvres before compulsorily discarding one card.&#10;&#10;The heart of the game is the 'meld.' A meld is simply the act of laying one or more cards from your hand in front of you, thus activating their powers. By having the most powerful political meld on the table (determined by the total number of flags on the melded cards), you control that country until toppled by better politics or combat. Each country normally has a couple of leaders, often with low numbers, and a varying number of higher-numbered followers who might be loyal to any leader card or just one.&#10;&#10;Power can be stolen in two ways: political coups where you lay more flag cards than are currently melded (you take over those cards as well - those willing rally to your cause), or by the time-honoured invasion force.&#10;&#10;Combat is simple enough, but can prove a little fiddly at times. Once battle is joined, a d6 is rolled to see how many rounds the battle will last. Rolling a one when there are two large armies will virtually guarantee a non-result, whereas a six will give both sides a good chance of a win. Swords kill simply on a roll of five or six, castles get to 'fight' in defence, and defending ships must be beaten first.&#10;&#10;The game has an excellent basic structure.  The key to the game is the balance of military, political power, and wealth.  It really works well.  But, as always, there are improvements to be made and rules that can be changed to improve or change the flavor of the game.  But, the reason why the game works well is that there is an excellent structure underlying the few contested rules.&#10;&#10;It's worth adding that a lot of the fun comes from the irreverent humour on the cards--just in case you thought you were playing a serious strategy game.  Names are satirical, silly, or obtuse references to real world people, places or events.  For example, there's a castle named &quot;Ratlarbig&quot; (look at it closely), a character called the &quot;Sorcerer's Apprentice&quot; and a group of soldiers called &quot;The Bloody Buggers&quot;. It's a hoot whether you're winning or losing.&#10;&#10;";1989;6.71132;2.1163;2;6;90;10;Bluffing, Card Game, Fantasy, Humor;great khan include page book x color map whamite isle die cut cardboard piece card plastic storage bag card strategy set whamite island fun usually last hour depend number chance idea gold possible country little empire dozen province available use card lot clever trick add provide depth easy pick require thought right deal card initially usually weak couple country add draw free card take card discard pile additionally buy extra card having check card event act immediately meld war political manoeuvre compulsorily discard card heart meld meld simply act lay card hand activate power have powerful political meld table determine total number flag meld card country topple well politic combat country normally couple leader low number vary number high numbered follower loyal leader card power steal way political coup lay flag card currently meld card willing rally cause time honour invasion force combat simple prove little fiddly time battle join d battle large army virtually guarantee non result side good chance sword kill simply castle fight defence defend ship beat excellent basic structure key balance military political power wealth work improvement change improve change flavor reason work excellent structure underlie contest worth add lot fun come irreverent humour card case think strategy name satirical silly obtuse reference real world people place event example castle name ratlarbig look closely character call sorcerer apprentice group soldier call bloody bugger hoot
2065;Shogi;"Of Japanese origins, Shogi is played on a 9 by 9 board, and the object is to capture the opponent's king. There are two main differences with Western chess. First, not only pawns but almost every piece can promote if it reaches the opponents three last rows. Second and most distinctive characteristic is that captured pieces become property of the capturing player and during his turn he can &quot;parachute&quot; or &quot;drop&quot; them back to the board instead of performing a normal move. Because of this feature, similar to Bughouse, the game can last longer than a Chess game, the board generally stays fairly crowded and there is no simplification going into the endgame. However, the endgame is typically more rapid with many possibilities for attack and ways to achieve a checkmate, which also makes draws/ties very rare.&#10;&#10;According to &quot;A World of Chess&quot; by Jean-Louis Cazaux &amp; Rick Knowlton (2017, ISBN 978-0-7864-9427-9), Bishop, Rook and Drunk Elephant were introduced to the 9x9 Shogi creating Sho Shogi, the immediate predecessor of Shogi, in the middle of the 15th century. Modern Shogi where created with the introduction of the drop rule and the removal of the Drunk Elephant piece in Sho Shogi. This happened between 1567 and 1587 (earliest recording of modern Shogi). The latter date is based upon a picture in the diary of the samurai Matsudaira Ietada, dated 1587, which shows a game identical to the one of today.&#10;&#10;";1587;7.39044;3.7892;2;2;60;8;Abstract Strategy;japanese origin shogi object capture opponent king main difference western chess pawn piece promote reach opponent row second distinctive characteristic capture piece property capture parachute drop instead perform normal similar bughouse long chess generally stay fairly crowded simplification go endgame endgame typically rapid possibility attack way achieve checkmate make draw tie rare accord world chess jean louis cazaux amp rick knowlton isbn bishop rook drunk elephant introduce x shogi creating sho shogi immediate predecessor shogi middle th century modern shogi create introduction drop removal drunk elephant piece sho shogi happen early recording modern shogi date base picture diary samurai matsudaira ietada date show identical today

Most important, you must protect your supply and replenishment ships, or your fleet will be unable to maintain combat momentum.  Sixth Fleet is a comprehensive simulation of the myriad elements involved in future naval confrontation.&#10;&#10;Each 8 hour game turn is broken into 3 distinct phases (sub, surface, and air) and each player takes turns choosing which phase they wish to conduct. Ex. if the US player chooses &quot;Air&quot;, they conduct all bombing, shipping strikes, anti-sub, and interception actions for all their aircraft.&#10;Players also use their units to attempt to &quot;detect&quot; enemy forces so that an attack can be made.

In September of 1944, three Allied airborne divisions dropped up to 60 miles behind German lines in Holland to seize and hold a series of roads and bridges until British ground forces could break through the front lines to link up with the paratroopers- to create an open road to the heart of the Third Reich.  Until now, the tragic yet fascinating story of Market-Garden has not been simulated on a level that allows an appreciation of the entire campaign, without bogging down in endless detail.  In Hell's Highway, players trace the leaden movement of XXX Corps along its jammed highway, drop the gallant paratroopers on the key bridges, and launch the unexpected panzers against the grim Arnhem defenders. Three scenarios and numerous deployment options allow players to explore the battle with historical hindsight, or to experience first-hand the confusion of those bloody days.&#10;&#10;Information from the back of the box:&#10;&#10;Two 20&quot; x 28&quot; maps - connected by their short edges to create a long, thin map area&#10;Two countersheets - 520 half-inch counters&#10;1300 meters/hex&#10;Three (3) turns/day&#10;&#10;Complexity - high.&#10;Solitaire suitability - medium.&#10;Number of players - (1 or) 2 players (also recommended for team play)&#10;Playing time - from 5 hours for a short scenario to 25 hours for a complete campaign&#10;&#10;";1983;7.35122;3.6885;1;4;1500;12;Wargame, World War II;operational simulation great airborne campaign world war ii september ally airborne division drop mile german line holland seize hold series road bridge british ground force break line link paratrooper create open road heart reich tragic fascinating story market garden simulate allow appreciation entire campaign bogge endless detail hell highway trace leaden xxx corps jammed highway drop gallant paratrooper key bridge launch unexpected panzer grim arnhem defender numerous deployment option allow explore battle historical hindsight experience hand confusion bloody day information box x map connect short edge create long thin map area countersheet half inch meter hex day complexity high solitaire suitability medium number recommend team playing time hour short hour complete campaign
2079;NATO: The Next War in Europe;"&quot;NATO: The Next War in Europe&quot; is an operational level simulation of potential NATO/Warsaw Pact conflict in Central Europe.&#10;&#10;The wargame is played on a single mapsheet, depicting the area from Denmark to the Swiss Alps, and from France to Poland.  Each player maneuvers ground forces that include armor, mech, infantry, airborne, airmobile, and marine units in an effort to control - or deny - key geographical objectives.  Designed to be played in one sitting, NATO combines ease of play with a sophisticated integrated  system of unit differentiation, command and supply structure, air power, force projection, chemical warfare, and tactical nuclear warfare.&#10;&#10;";1983;6.72444;3.2143;2;2;240;12;Modern Warfare, Wargame;nato war europe operational simulation potential nato warsaw pact conflict central europe wargame single mapsheet depict area denmark swiss alp france poland maneuver ground force include armor mech infantry airborne airmobile marine unit effort deny key geographical sit nato combine ease sophisticated integrate unit differentiation command supply structure air power force projection chemical warfare tactical nuclear warfare
2081;The Civil War 1861-1865;"This sprawling rendition of the American Civil War tries to fit in everything, from Grant and Lee down to Indian raids in the Western territories. It also includes the most extensive treatment of naval and riverine warfare of any strategic Civil War game. The map covers the theater of the war from the Eastern seaboard to the middle of Texas at 25 miles per hex. An optional second map extends to New Mexico. There are five turns per year, four of two months each and a four-month Winter turn. Each turn consists of an indefinite number of &quot;pulses&quot; and may last a long, long time. Troops are represented by generic Strength Points (about 5,000 men per SP, or one or two ironclads with escorting naval vessels).&#10;&#10;The key concepts in the game are Theaters, Command Points, Pulses and Leaders.&#10;&#10;&#10;     There are three Theaters: East, West and Trans-Mississippi. Players must prioritize them each turn as primary, secondary and tertiary. These designations are made a turn in advance, requiring a modest degree of foresight. Higher priority Theaters receive larger allocations of Command Points and thus will see more activity.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Command Points are needed to perform most of the game's functions, such as moving SP's, consolidating SP's into Armies, constructing fortifications, adding naval SP's, sacking unwanted generals, etc. Players obtain them by dice rolls at the start of each turn. In addition to CP's assigned to individual theaters, they receive an allotment of &quot;discretionary&quot; CP's that can be used in any Theater. The Union also gets Naval CP's. Additional CP's may be generated during a turn, as noted below.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Each turn is divided into an indefinite number of Pulses. To begin a Pulse, each player rolls two dice. The difference between the results is the number of actions each must take in that Pulse (high roller first). Actions may be used to expend Command Points, to muster SP reinforcements or to bring inew or newly promoted Leaders into play. If the dice rolls are equal, either the turn ends immediately or each player receives additional Command Points. The likelihood of an immediate end rises with the number of tied rolls and is a certainty on the fourth tie. If the turn doesn't end in this fashion, it continues until all Command Points have been used and available reinforcements and Leaders entered.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     While Strength Points are abstract, the game includes more than 60 historical Leaders, who enter play at about the time that they rose to prominence in real life. Each Leader has a rank (one to four stars) and ratings for Initiative, Tactical Combat and Army Command. Many begin at lower ranks and can be promoted. Sherman, for instance, has a single star when he appears but can rise to four. Like Presidents Lincoln and Davis in real life, players don't have absolute control over promotions, nor does every Leader perform better at a higher rank. A Leader's rank determines the number of SP's he can command - up to two for a one star, up to six for higher ranks. Assigning as many SP's as permitted to a Leader (preferably a capable one) is economical, since he can move his entire force by expending Command Points equal to his Initiative. (Lower Initiative numbers are better in this game.) Without Leaders, SP's cost one CP each to move, rendering them all but static. Better yet are Armies, which can be as large as 25 SP's and must be commanded by a three or four star Leader. (Each Army has its own maximum size, based on its historical counterpart.)&#10;&#10;&#10;The game has much more: an elaborate combat resolution procedure, somewhat less elaborate supply rules, a naval system that is a game in itself, cavalry, railroads, militia, neutral states and a chrome-laden option to add the Far West map and Theater.&#10;&#10;Players gain Victory Points primarily by capturing major enemy and neutral cities and winning neutral states to their side. The South also gets VP's for successful commerce raiding and for isolating or capturing Washington, D.C. It wins at once if it captures Washington at a moment when it has more VP's than the North. Otherwise, VP's are checked in November 1864 and April 1865, when the game comes to a definitive end.&#10;&#10;For those who lack time or patience for the full war, scenarios are provided with the historical setups as of the start of 1862, 1863 and 1864.&#10;&#10;The Civil War isn't the biggest game ever produced on that dreadful conflict, but it is certainly among the most ambitious in its scope and degree of detail.

2083;Checkers;"Abstract strategy game where players move disc-shaped pieces across an 8 by 8 cross-hatched (&quot;checker&quot;) board. &#10;Pieces only move diagonally, and only one space at a time.  If a player can move one of his pieces so that it jumps over an adjacent piece of their opponent and into an empty space, that player captures the opponent's disc.  Jumping moves must be taken when possible, thereby creating a strategy game where players offer up jumps in exchange for setting up the board so that they jump even more pieces on their turn.  A player wins by removing all of his opponent's pieces from the board or by blocking the opponent so that he has no more moves.&#10;This game, also known as Draughts, is part of the Checkers family.&#10;&#10;The Official Checker Board to be used in tournaments and official matches of associations like international WCDF, ACF, and APCA usually shall be colored of green and off-white (buff).

2087;Magic Dance;"A memory and strategy game also published by F.X. Schmid under the title Dance of the Witches, this is essentially Pachisi but so that the playing pieces' identities are hidden, and after a while the game gets pretty chaotic with each player trying desperately to remember which of the witches belong to them and not help opponents or hinder themselves by mistake - it's even possible to drive opposing pieces home by driving them into your own base by mistake, in which case they will instantly teleport to the correct one. Also, pieces are not captured - probably because this would mean revealing their identity - but simply jumped back 7 spaces on the track and if that space is occupied, they're jumped back another 7, and so on. It is possible to make any one piece's identity public for a moment though, by rolling a 6, but that 6 cannot then be used for movement also.&#10;&#10;Like Sagaland/Enchanted Forest - which the playing pieces will bring to memory - this is more of a family game than simply a children's game.&#10;&#10;";1988;5.76983;1.4561;3;6;45;8;Bluffing, Children's Game, Deduction, Memory;memory strategy publish f x schmid title dance witch essentially pachisi playing piece identity hide get pretty chaotic try desperately remember witch belong help opponent hinder mistake possible drive oppose piece home drive base mistake case instantly teleport correct piece capture probably mean reveal identity simply jump space track space occupy jump possible piece identity public moment like sagaland enchant forest playing piece bring memory family simply child

2093;Mahjong;"Mah-Jongg (Chinese &#233;&#186;&#187;&#229;&#176;&#135;/&#233;&#186;&#187;&#229;&#176;&#134; M&aacute;ji&agrave;ng [game of the] sparrow) is a traditional Chinese game using illustrated tiles, with game play similarities to rummy.  It is a popular gambling game, but wagering real stakes is by no means necessary to have fun playing.&#10;&#10;The tiles consist of three suits numbering 1-9 (Dots, Numbers or Characters, and Bamboo, the &quot;Ace&quot; of which almost always looks like a bird), three different dragons (Red, Green, and White [white is unusual in that it may look like a silvery dragon, or like a picture frame, or blank - think &quot;White dragon in a snowstorm&quot;), and the four winds (east, south, west, and north).  There are four copies of each tile.  This totals to 136 tiles. In addition, special Flower, Season, and Joker (American version) tiles may also be used.&#10;&#10;Four players take turns drawing from a stock (the wall), or from the other players' discards, in an attempt to form sets of numeric sequences (e.g., 5-6-7 of the same suit, which can only be drawn from the player at one's left, by calling &quot;Chow&quot;), triplets and quadruplets (which can be drawn from the discards out-of-turn by calling &quot;Pung&quot;), pairs, and other patterns. &quot;Pung&quot; takes precedence over &quot;Chow&quot;, and &quot;Mah Jongg&quot; takes precedence over all (and is the only situation one may draw &quot;Chow&quot; out-of-turn.) What happens if a single discard would give two (or more!) players &quot;Mah Jongg&quot;? Precedence goes to the player who would play next in normal sequence.&#10;&#10;Originating in China in the mid-19th century, it was introduced to the U.S. in the 1920s.  It is now played in different forms throughout Asia, Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand.  Although the rules for game play are fairly constant, there are an immense variety of scoring schemes.  A few general categories of rule-sets include:  Chinese Classical, Hong Kong Old Style, Japanese, Taiwanese, Western, and American.&#10;&#10;";1850;7.05198;2.583;3;4;120;8;Abstract Strategy;mah jongg chinese m aacute ji agrave ng sparrow traditional chinese illustrate tile similarity rummy popular gambling wager real stake mean necessary fun tile consist suit number dot number character bamboo ace look like bird different dragon red green white white unusual look like silvery dragon like picture frame blank think white dragon snowstorm wind east south west north copy tile total tile addition special flower season joker american tile draw stock wall discard attempt form set numeric sequence e g suit draw leave call chow triplet quadruplet draw discard call pung pair pattern pung take precedence chow mah jongg take precedence situation draw chow happen single discard mah jongg precedence go normal sequence originate china mid th century introduce u different form asia europe north america australia new zealand fairly constant immense variety scheme general category set include chinese classical hong kong old style japanese taiwanese western american

Wells' Time Machine to travel to the future, attempting to solve infamous cases from the 20th Century.&#10;&#10;Each player assumes the role of Holmes and matches wits with the other players to determine who possesses the most skillful powers of deduction. The game includes 20 cases based on famous crimes and criminals of the 20th Century, including the Zodiac Killer, Sacco and Vanzetti, the Lindbergh Kidnapping, and &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot;. Each case is represented by a card that features a crime told in story form, a selection of probable suspects and a list of locations involved in that crime.&#10;&#10;The board represents the various cities the crimes occurred in, with eighteen generic locations to find clues (Pharmacy, Hotel, Airport, Supermarket, Tavern, Harbor, FBI, etc.). Players must collect clues from different locations, noting them down on their checklists as they attempt to find the answers to the questions listed on the case card. Movement is via die roll.&#10;&#10;Naturally, the crime scene will often contain vital clues, and a prudent detective always checks with the neighbors. Still, you can learn something important almost anywhere in town. The first player to figure out the correct answers to a particular mystery or crime, return to the Time Machine and announce the solution, is the winner.&#10;&#10;There are two versions of this edition: Standard and Deluxe.

2121;The Sword and the Stars;"Sword and the Stars sets the stage for interstellar conflict between vying empires on such a scale (the map depicts about 1/4 of a spiral galaxy) that individual ships and even fleets become insignificant. You pay for and resolve entire interstellar campaigns with cards representing massive scale investment of manpower and resources over 4 Earth years of operations, each player round representing the passage of 20 years. Players direct the fate of interstellar empires through expansion or consolidation by means of conquests, raids, governing, building planetary defenses, commerce, and diplomacy.&#10;&#10;The game was derived from two existing popular SPI titles. While adding many subtle changes in its own right, it combines the highly successful system used in Empires of the Middle Ages with the graphic layout used for Freedom in the Galaxy. Technology and economics are abstracted, but both play a large role in just about every aspect of the game. Stargates allow players to conduct interstellar operations against any star system, free of range constraints. This means that in an interstellar war, nowhere is safe from your enemies.&#10;&#10;Includes a mechanism for a sort of Galactic Security Council, where players can scheme all sorts of mischief against each other.&#10;&#10;Ten scenarios (including the &quot;Galactic Cycle&quot; campaign game) are supplied. A &quot;short&quot; game will depict a period lasting about 200 years, while for the long &quot;grand campaign&quot; scenario it is recommended to play &quot;at least&quot; 1000 years. The Sword and the Stars is more compact than Empires. Includes 400 counters, 56 year cards, a 17 x 22&quot; map depicting a total of 42 star systems. Maximum 5 players (3-4 recommended).&#10;&#10;Historical Note:&#10;Writing about SPI's Empires of the Middle Ages (q.v.), editor Kula included a sidebar quote from Redmond Simonsen to the effect that &quot;a good number of people...would really enjoy the game if they'd just imagine that it's a science fictional or fantastic continent instead of Europe&quot;. Well, in 1981, the year after Empires of the Middle Ages was released, SPI produced another game using the same system and the missing science fiction premise, and The Sword and the Stars was born.&#10;&#10;";1981;6.32792;3.0526;1;5;240;12;Civilization, Economic, Political, Science Fiction, Wargame;sword star set stage interstellar conflict vie empire scale map depict spiral galaxy individual ship fleet insignificant pay resolve entire interstellar campaign card represent massive scale investment manpower resource earth year operation represent passage year direct fate interstellar empire consolidation mean conquest raid govern building planetary defense commerce diplomacy derive exist popular spi title add subtle change right combine highly successful empire middle age graphic layout freedom galaxy technology economic abstract large role aspect stargate allow conduct interstellar operation star free range constraint mean interstellar war safe enemy include mechanism sort galactic security council scheme sort mischief include galactic cycle campaign supply short depict period last year long grand campaign recommend year sword star compact empire include year card x map depict total star maximum recommend historical note write spi empire middle age q v editor kula include sidebar quote redmond simonsen effect good number people enjoy d imagine science fictional fantastic continent instead europe year empire middle age release spi produce miss science fiction premise sword star bear
2123;Shadowrun: The Trading Card Game;"This game takes fantasy with magic, elves, dwarves, orcs, trolls etc., and puts them in a cyberpunk world 60 years in the future.&#10;&#10;There are 7 types of cards...&#10;&#10;&#10;    Runners - You collect groups of these characters and use them to make runs on objectives.  Some of these can  support the group through computers while staying safe at home.  These cards have symbols on them that represent their abilities and these are use to bypass threats without actually having to face them.&#10;    Objectives - These are what you are making runs on.  They are worth reputation points and usually have a task that you must best or a number of symbols that you have to match with the symbols on your runners.&#10;    Challenge - You assign these to the objectives as additional hurdles that you have to get by before you can tackle the objective.  Usually you can overcome them with the right symbols but if not they can represent nasty things you will have to fight or things that will just hurt you.&#10;    Gear - This is stuff that you assign to runners to help them make runs.  Some gear requires you to have a runner with a matching symbol.&#10;    Locations - These represent places that you control and can help you in various ways.&#10;    Contacts - These represent people that will help you. &#10;    Specials - These are instants that you play to affect the current situation.&#10;&#10;&#10;Everything is driven by money which is hard to come by.

2125;Amazons;"The game is played on a square grid, usually 10 by 10.  Each player starts with four amazons (which move as chess queens, but do not capture) placed in predetermined locations on their side of the board.  On a player turn, he moves one amazon and then fires an arrow from the arrival position. Firing an arrow consists in placing a new arrow piece on the board; also the arrow moves like a queen from the position it is fired. The landed arrow doesn't move anymore and creates a permanent block on the board. Arrows can not be passed through by either amazons or other arrows.  The first player who can not make a legal move (move and then shoot) loses the game.&#10;&#10;";1992;7.20454;2.8125;2;2;30;12;Abstract Strategy;square grid usually start amazon chess queen capture place predetermine location amazon fire arrow arrival position fire arrow consist place new arrow piece arrow like queen position fire land arrow doesn t anymore create permanent block arrow pass amazon arrow legal shoot
2127;Overpower;"This defunct CCG is primarily based on characters from Marvel comics, with DC and Image comics represented in later expansions.&#10;&#10;Each player has a team of 4 characters, each rated in 3 or 4 skill types. At the beginning of each hand, each player makes a wager of some of their 7 mission cards based on how confident they are that they can &quot;win&quot; the hand by causing the most damage. Players then take turns playing a card from their hand or cards set aside from previous hands. Cards include Power cards (basic attack or defense in a skill type), Universe cards (e.g., a city bus, which adds value to a Strength attack), Special cards (usually character specific with varying effects), and more in later expansions. At the end of each hand, the damage from that hand is totaled; the player who caused the most &quot;completes&quot; their wagered missions, while the other player is &quot;defeated&quot; with those missions. Players may concede a hand instead of playing a card, losing their missions but avoiding further damage&#10;&#10;A player wins when they have knocked out all 4 opposing characters, &quot;completed&quot; all of their missions, or their opponent is &quot;defeated&quot; in all missions. (There is also a basic game option without the use of missions or conceding, in which the sole victory condition is knocking out the opposing team.)&#10;&#10;";1995;5.73537;1.8684;2;2;30;10;Card Game, Collectible Components, Comic Book / Strip, Fantasy, Fighting;defunct ccg primarily base character marvel comic_strip dc image comic_strip represent late team character rate skill beginning hand make wager mission card base confident hand cause damage card hand card set aside previous hand card include power card basic attack defense skill universe card e g city bus add value strength attack special card usually character specific varying effect late end hand damage hand total cause complete wager mission defeat mission concede hand instead card mission avoid damage knock oppose character complete mission opponent defeat mission basic option use mission conceding sole condition knock oppose team

2133;Rage;"Publisher Blurb&#10;These are the last days. Gaia is dying. The Apocalypse is here.&#10;&#10;Will you fall defending her or die a cowards death? Will your pack live in legend as the ones who saved the world, or those who betrayed it?&#10;&#10;Is today a good day to die?&#10;&#10;Take control of a pack of Garou, savage werewolves, as they battle the forces of the Wyrm in defense of Mother Earth, Gaia.&#10;&#10;Call upon ancient spirit pacts, mystical abilities, and the tools of the modern world to destroy the forces of corruption that threaton to plunge the world into eternal darkness and decay.&#10;&#10;But not every Garou agrees how best to save Gaia. Is it best done through force? Through renewing the traditions and spirit pacts of old? Through mystical means? Or should the Garou just adapt to the new age and help Gaia change to fit into the new world?&#10;&#10;Or sell out and play a pack of Wyrm creatures hell bent on seeing that the Wyrm is the final victor in the coming Apocalypse.&#10;&#10;But not even the forces of the Wyrm can agree on their methods. Should they concentrate on corrupting humans and Garou to do the Wyrm's bidding? Should they fight the Garou claw to claw? Or should they win the war by destroying every last thing the Garou love and cherish?&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;Each player has two decks. One deck is his &quot;Sept&quot; hand.  This is composed of allies, equipment, fetishes, events, victims, gifts, quests, and several other card types depending on which expansions you are using.  The other deck is a combat deck showing special maneuvers which are used when two characters are engaged in combat.&#10;&#10;Play begins with each player laying out his pack (collection of Character cards).  These are all the characters the player will have for that game.  The game ends when one pack achieves the same number of Renown as they had starting Renown.  Typically, players start with a 20 Renown pack (each character has a Renown) and thus the game ends when someone has 20 renown in their victory pile.&#10;&#10;Play is simultaneous, with all players taking actions at the same time - conflicts are generally resolved based on the renown of the character taking an action; well known characters go first.  The game is split into several phases:&#10;Redraw - draw your Sept hand back to 5 cards&#10;Regeneration - heal characters that have been hurt&#10;Resource - play most cards like gifts, equipment etc.&#10;Umbra - play special umbra cards and actions&#10;Moot - play special cards which may change rules. These must be voted on by all players.&#10;Combat - resolve any fights.&#10;&#10;Each round a player designates one of his characters as Alpha.  The Alpha becomes the primary actor for that round.  During the combat round, Alphas may:&#10;1) Attack another Alpha&#10;2) Attack a victim&#10;3) Attack an enemy&#10;4) Challenge an ally or a non-Alpha character&#10;5) Attack a territory&#10;6) Do nothing.&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved using a separate deck which allows special maneuvers.&#10;&#10;Renown (victory points) are earned by defeating rival characters and enemies. Some packs may reverse the rules and gain victory by defeating victims.  Renown can also be earned from moots and quests.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.1219;2.3864;2;6;45;12;Card Game, Collectible Components, Fighting, Horror;publisher blurb day gaia die apocalypse fall defend die coward death pack live legend one save world betray today good day die pack garou savage werewolf battle force wyrm defense mother earth gaia ancient spirit pact mystical tool modern world destroy force corruption threaton plunge world eternal darkness decay garou agree good save gaia well force renew tradition spirit pact old mystical mean garou adapt new age help gaia change fit new world sell pack wyrm creature hell bent see wyrm final victor come apocalypse force wyrm agree method concentrate corrupt human garou wyrm bidding fight garou claw claw war destroy thing garou love cherish deck deck sept hand compose ally equipment fetish event victim gift quest card depend deck combat deck show special maneuver character engage combat begin lay pack character card character end pack achieve number renown start renown typically start renown pack character renown end renown pile simultaneous take action time conflict generally resolve base renown character take action know character split redraw draw sept hand card regeneration heal character hurt resource card like gift equipment etc umbra special umbra card action moot special card change vote combat resolve fight designate character alpha alpha primary actor combat alpha attack alpha attack victim attack enemy challenge ally non alpha character attack territory combat resolve separate deck allow special maneuver renown earn defeat rival character enemy pack reverse gain defeat victim renown earn moot quest
2135;On the Edge;"On the Edge is a card game based on the Over the Edge RPG setting. It was one of the earliest to jump on the Magic/collectible bandwagon.  To their credit they did create a game that was very unlike Magic in play and flavor. The card types are:&#10;&#10;Characters - These are your soldiers and they are laid out in a grid that is a maximum of three deep.  You can only attack or defend with the first untapped character in each row (with exceptions of course).  Some characters also generate Pull points.  These are used like money to bring cards in play or to generate influence which is needed to win so they of course must be protected.&#10;&#10;Resources - These generate Pull for bringing cards into play.  Pull generated from resources can not be used to generate influence.&#10;&#10;Whammy - These are instants that you can play anytime.&#10;&#10;Gear - These are items you can assign to characters.&#10;&#10;Condition - These are assigned to characters and can have positive or negative affects.&#10;&#10;Environmental - These cards affect the game as a whole.&#10;&#10;Secrets - These usually affect cards from specific conspiracies.&#10;&#10;The game is generally played by putting your big hitters in your front row, your big defenders in your second row and your pull generators in your last row.  First player to generate a predetermined amount of influence wins.&#10;&#10;The art on the cards is very strange and different people either love or despise.&#10;&#10;";1994;6.29387;2.3913;2;5;45;12;Card Game, Collectible Components, Fighting;edge card base edge rpg set early jump magic collectible bandwagon credit create unlike magic flavor card character soldier lay grid maximum deep attack defend untapped character row exception course character generate pull like money bring card generate influence need course protect resource generate pull bring card pull generate resource generate influence whammy instant anytime gear item assign character condition assign character positive negative affect environmental card affect secret usually affect card specific conspiracy generally put big hitter row big defender second row pull generator row generate predetermined influence art card strange different people love despise
2137;Quest for the Grail;"King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table make their way to the CCG world via this game.  The object of the game is to go on quests to reap rewards or valor. With 12 valor you can make a quest for the grail to win the game.&#10;&#10;You play with two decks.  The quest deck has quests that your or your opponents can undertake.&#10;&#10;Your court deck has your warriors (who go on the quests), domains (which supply power to pay the upkeep on cards in play), companions (who are assigned to a warrior to help him), events (which can be played anytime and have different durations), spells (which can only be cast by a warrior or companion who is an enchanter), combat (which are used in combat to affect your abilities) and rewards (which can be assigned to a warrior in lieu of valor upon completion of a quest).&#10;&#10;To go on the quest for the grail a warrior must have 12 or more valor.  He then completes 3 quests from the quest deck in a row while maintaining 12 or more valor.&#10;&#10;Also credited as a designer is Richard Trainham.

A player may fold instead of playing if he has won at least one trick with a bug.  He is out for the rest of the round and can not win the hand.  After six rounds have been played the winner of the hand is the person who has taken the fewest bugs more then zero.

2155;Agent of Change;"Agent of Change is the rail game of West Virginia, pitting the players against the mountains and each other.  The object of the game is to link the Great East Coast Cities to the Ohio River and amass $250 million first.  This game is very similar to the standard Mayfair Empire Builder games except that it was a limited edition game for the Huntington Museum of Art as part of their exhibit entitled &quot;Agent of Change: The Railroad in West Virginia&quot;.  Aspects of this game that makes it different than the other Mayfair crayon games is the use of the load sheet, the ability to build coal mines, and the extremely mountainous terrain.  Instead of load cards, the game uses two dice and a load sheet where the player rolls dice and reference the master load sheet to determine the available contracts.  Building coal mines involves building rails through coal mine spaces which causes a load of coal to be available at the nearest coal city.  Since West Virginia is naturally mountainous, the competition for the best routes is extremely competitive, even in a two-player game.&#10;&#10;";1991;5.27273;3.0;2;4;90;12;Trains;agent change rail west virginia pit mountain object link great east coast city ohio river amass million similar standard mayfair empire builder limited huntington museum art exhibit entitle agent change railroad west virginia aspect make different mayfair crayon use load sheet build coal mine extremely mountainous terrain instead load card use dice load sheet dice reference master load sheet determine available contract build coal mine involve building rail coal space cause load coal available near coal city west virginia naturally mountainous competition good route extremely competitive
2157;Riddle of the Ring;"In this fairly simple game based on The Lord of the Rings, you play one of four Hobbits or one of four Black Riders.  Each player competes against all the other players to win.  A Hobbit player wins if he can get the one ring to the Cracks of Doom and survive for one turn.  A Black Rider player wins if he can get the ring to Barad-Dur and survive for one turn.&#10;&#10;There is a map of Middle Earth but this is a card driven game.  The map generally hinders movement and supplies places to draw cards.  Cards can be tools to help you fight or move through types of terrain at a reduced cost.&#10;&#10;A players turn consists of moving, having Friendly Exchanges, executing Power Plays, and drawing cards.  Power Plays include looking at other player&rsquo;s hands, taking cards from another player, and/or executing a battle against another player.&#10;&#10;Though game play is simple and fast, strategies and subtleties of play are not always obvious and requires intelligent play through good timing in movement, using cards effectively, and especially having Friendly Exchanges and Power Plays in combinations to achieve maximum advantage.&#10;&#10;Optional rules include playing as partners (Hobbits vs. Black Riders) and the enhanced two-player game where one player controls all four Hobbits and the other player controls all four Black Riders.&#10;&#10;";1982;6.90418;2.1176;2;8;120;13;Adventure, Fantasy, Novel-based;fairly simple base lord ring hobbit black rider compete hobbit ring crack doom survive black rider ring barad dur survive map middle earth card drive map generally hinder supply place draw card card tool help fight terrain reduce cost consist have friendly exchange execute power draw card power include look rsquo hand take card execute battle simple fast strategy subtlety obvious require intelligent good timing card effectively especially have friendly exchange power combination achieve maximum advantage optional include partner hobbit vs black rider enhanced hobbit black rider
2159;Kimbo;"The 15X15 board has squares with slots on each side.  The four corners, start areas, are enclosed boxes with two exits each that hold your 4 pawns, one in each corner.  The middle nine squares comprise a large box with four entrances.  The goal of the game is to get all four of your pawns into the middle box (home).  In front of each entrance are fences that are set into the slots.&#10;&#10;On your turn you may remove one of your fences and place it in any slot on the board.  You then roll two dice and move one of your pawns the total or two of your pawns, each the amount of one of the dice.  Once a pawn starts moving it may not change direction unless it hits a wall or fence.  Upon hitting either the pawn moves at a 90 degree angle from the obstacle.  If you land on an opposing piece by exact count you send it back to any of the start boxes.  If you roll doubles you may take one piece and jump an adjoining fence instead of a move.  To move a piece to home you need it to enter at one of the entrances by exact count.&#10;&#10;";1960;6.25476;1.75;2;4;45;8;Racing;x square slot corner start area enclose box exit hold pawn corner middle square comprise large box entrance pawn middle box home entrance fence set slot remove fence place slot dice pawn total pawn dice pawn start change direction hit wall fence hit pawn degree angle obstacle land oppose piece exact count send start box double piece jump adjoining fence instead piece home need enter entrance exact count

2163;Space Hulk;"Space Hulk is a light miniatures wargame set in the Warhammer 40K universe.  It has a relatively simple rule-set (compared to Warhammer 40K itself) and is known for its fast play and immersive theme (think the movie Aliens).&#10;&#10;You lay out corridors and rooms that represent a space hulk, a large disabled ship floating in space. The Space Marines wear powerful space battle suits and carry heavy weaponry. The Genestealers (reminiscent of the alien in Alien) are naked, except for their quick movement, multiple clawed arms capable of ripping through Terminator armor and their seemingly endless numbers.&#10;&#10;Each game is played as a scenario.  The Space Marines win by completing a certain goal, such as retrieving an artifact and escaping alive.  The Genestealers win by stopping the Space Marines from achieving their goal, usually by killing them all. A unique mechanism is that the Genestealers have no time limit for their turn, but the Space Marines have a 3 minute time limit, and less if a sergeant is killed. This simulates the fact that Genestealers move so much quicker and adds a lot of tension to the game for the Marine player.&#10;&#10;The miniatures are excellent although you do have to paint them yourselves and the modular board is very well done.&#10;&#10;The Deathwing Expansion adds new personnel, weapons, rules for multilevel hulks, new missions and a mission generator along with some complexity.&#10;&#10;The Genestealer Expansion adds new marines, weapons, Genestealer Hybrids who can use weapons and new missions. There are also rules for psychic powers.&#10;&#10;There was also the Space Hulk Campaign Book  that can be linked for longer games. This book also added rules for traitor Marines and new weapons.&#10;&#10;Even with all rules in place the game does not get too complicated and is a very good introduction to Warhammer 40K.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;Space Hulk (2nd Edition)&#10;Space Hulk (3rd Edition)&#10;Space Hulk (4th Edition)&#10;&#10;";1989;7.49043;2.5;2;2;45;12;Fighting, Miniatures, Science Fiction, Wargame;space hulk light miniature wargame set warhammer k universe relatively simple set compare warhammer k know fast immersive think movie alien lay corridor room represent space hulk large disabled ship float space space marine wear powerful space battle suit carry heavy weaponry genestealer reminiscent alien alien naked quick multiple claw arm capable rip terminator armor seemingly endless number space marines complete certain retrieve artifact escape alive genestealer stop space marine achieve usually kill unique mechanism genestealer time limit space marine minute time limit sergeant kill simulate fact genestealer quick add lot tension marine miniature excellent paint modular deathwing add new personnel weapon multilevel hulk new mission mission generator complexity genestealer add new marines weapon genestealer hybrid use weapon new mission psychic power space hulk campaign book link long book add traitor marine new weapon place complicated good introduction warhammer k implement space hulk nd space hulk rd space hulk th

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Pok&eacute;mon is a Collectible Card Games based upon Japanese anime that have found success internationally, and is one of the longest surviving CCGs currently available. Pok&eacute;mon was one of the first Collectible Card Games to offer any competition to the market dominance of Magic:  The Gathering.&#10;&#10;Many people who buy the product often do not play the game, choosing instead to collect their favorite characters from the franchise the game is based upon.&#10;&#10;Each player plays the role of a Pok&eacute;mon trainer that use their Pok&eacute;mon creatures to battle the Pok&eacute;mon creatures of the other Pok&eacute;mon trainer.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to play your Pok&eacute;mon cards, that represent different creatures, and be the first player to &quot;knock out&quot; (defeat) six opposing Pok&eacute;mon.  You play the game with a deck of sixty cards that include your Pok&eacute;mon, as well as Trainer cards and Energy cards.  Trainer cards affect the game, players, or Pok&eacute;mon in different ways, most of them temporary, while Energy cards act as the resources in the game.&#10;&#10;You start the game by drawing seven cards to your hand.  Each player picks a Basic Pok&eacute;mon from their hand and places it in front of them to start.  This is called the Active Pok&eacute;mon and is the one currently dueling.  Players can also place other Basic Pok&eacute;mon to fill up the five slots on their &quot;Bench&quot;.  Six cards are then set aside to act as Prize cards.  Each time you defeat one of your opponent's Pok&eacute;mon, you get to draw one of these Prize cards.&#10;&#10;Players take alternating turns during which they can:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Draw a card from their deck to their hand&#10;     Play Actions:&#10;         Put Basic Pok&eacute;mon in play from their hand to their Bench&#10;         Evolve their Pok&eacute;mon&#10;         Attach an Energy card to one of their Pok&eacute;mon (once per turn)&#10;         Play Trainer cards (Only 1 Stadium card and 1 Supporter card per turn)&#10;         Retreat their Active Pok&eacute;mon (once per turn - trade places with one on the Bench (usually at the cost of Energy cards))&#10;         Use Abilities&#10;    &#10;     Attack&#10;&#10;&#10;In addition to Basic Pok&eacute;mon cards, there are also Evolution cards, which depict evolved forms of Basic Pok&eacute;mon (or sometimes other Evolved Pok&eacute;mon). A player can evolve a Pok&eacute;mon by laying a corresponding Evolution card onto another Pok&eacute;mon card in play.  This can only be done once per turn per Pok&eacute;mon, and only if the Pok&eacute;mon has been in play at least one entire turn.  The Evolved Pok&eacute;mon retains any damage and Energy cards, but loses any Special Conditions affecting it, and the card text completely replaces the previous card.&#10;&#10;The last action a player takes during their turn, if they choose, is to have their Active Pok&eacute;mon use one of its abilities to attack the other player's Active Pok&eacute;mon.  Attacks can only be used if the Pok&eacute;mon has enough Energy cards of the right type attached to it to meet the requirements for the attack; each attack has different requirements and effects that are listed on the card.  Most attacks will do some amount of damage to the Defending Pok&eacute;mon; if defeated, the Defending Pok&eacute;mon is replaced with another Pok&eacute;mon from the Bench, and the attacker draws a Prize card.  If either the attacker draws their last Prize card or the Defender cannot replace the Active Pok&eacute;mon (due to an empty Bench), the attacker has won the game.&#10;&#10;There are many different varieties of Pok&eacute;mon available and several different forms of each one, each with different attacks, abilities and characteristics, allowing for many different possible outcomes.

2169;Arcadia: The Wyld Hunt;"No starter packs.  &#10;Each booster has the rules. &#10;You only need to buy two boosters to play with.&#10;&#10;From a marketing standpoint this game should have sold well.  You do not have to purchase boxes of cards to play.  You buy a character pack and a story pack then find someone else who has done the same and play.&#10;&#10;In the character pack you will get a character who stands up and all the cards you need to make him unique.  Each character has stats for might, resolve, savvy and combat.  You can add 5 points to spend upgrading your character.  You upgrade with 5 types of cards called merits with varying costs.  Abilities generally boost one of your 4 attributes.  Advantages are special skills available to the character. Allies are friends that travel with you and add their skills to help you.  Arts are magic abilities that help you in various ways.  Treasures are items that you can carry to help you or you can find them in your journeys.  If you want to add more then 5 points to your character you can add flaws which are worth negative points.  If you add 2 points of flaws then you would have seven points of merits you could add.  These come in three flavors.  Curses represent special liabilities of your character.  Enemies represent individuals or races with great hatred for you which if met fight with an advantage.  Weakness usually affect your stats.  Once you have created your character you can go on an adventure.&#10;&#10;In your story pack you will find leagues which are put together to create a map. Each league has a terrain type or types, cost to enter or leave, special affects and what attribute you may recover if resting there.  In your story pack you will also find quest cards.  The quest card tells you what you are trying to achieve.  Each quest has four attributes.  These are Experience points received when the quest is achieved, Total points of waylays allowed against the quest, total points in treasures that can be seeded and the victory conditions required to complete the quest.  You will also find waylay cards in your story pack.  These will have indicators on them to tell you in what terrain you are allowed to play them in.  There is a point rating that is applied against the quests waylay rating.  Each waylay also has a test that must be passed.  Failing a waylay can have dire consequences or it may just delay you by one turn.&#10;&#10;It is a very simple game that never plays the same way twice as long as you have a few boosters around to mix things up.&#10;&#10;";1996;5.72006;2.1429;1;5;30;10;Card Game, Collectible Components, Exploration, Fantasy, Fighting;starter pack booster need buy booster marketing standpoint sell purchase box card buy character pack story pack find character pack character stand card need unique character stat resolve savvy combat add spend upgrade character upgrade card call merit vary cost generally boost attribute advantage special skill available character ally friend travel add skill help art magic help way treasure item carry help find journey want add character add flaw worth negative add flaw seven merit add come flavor curse represent special liability character enemy represent individual race great hatred met fight advantage weakness usually affect stat create character adventure story pack find league create map league terrain cost enter leave special affect attribute recover rest story pack find quest card quest card tell try achieve quest attribute experience receive quest achieve total waylay allow quest total treasure seed condition require complete quest find waylay card story pack indicator tell terrain allow rating apply quest waylay rate waylay test pass fail waylay dire consequence delay simple way twice long booster mix thing

2173;4 Player Chess;"Four-Player Chess (Four-handed chess, Chess-4, and 4-Chess) is often credited to Capt Charles Verney, who was the first known to have documented the game in England in 1881.  Four-player versions of chess probably have existed for hundreds of years prior to Verney in one form or another.  Verney's four-player board consists of three rows added to each side of a standard 2-player board, and four complete sets of chessmen in four different colors.  Modern four-player boards and colored pieces are available from several manufacturers.&#10;&#10;In Verney's version (1881), 4 player chess was a partnership game, and the object was to checkmate both opposing partners at the same time.  In modern variants, four player games can range from partners, to cutthroat (every player for himself), to temporary alliances at will.&#10;&#10;Starting configuration affects fairness (bias).  The standard 2-player configuration of queen facing queen is biased in four player chess because there is only one axis of symmetry.  Four player chess requires two axes of symmetry to be fair (unbiased).  To avoid bias, Verney recommended a staring configuration of all queens on light (or all on dark) squares.  Another unbiased starting configuration is all queens on the right (or all on the left) of the king.&#10;&#10;For the most part, four player chess follows (or can follow) all the normal rules of two-player chess.  Verney had special rules for partnership playing, disallowed castling, and pawns had to make it to the enemies last rank in order to be exchanged for another piece.  Pawns could also march up and back down the board.  Verney also had checkmate as the ultimate move.&#10;&#10;In modern variations of four-player chess, partnering may not be required, but allowable, castling can be allowed, and actual capturing of a king a required move to eliminate a player.  The Chess Federation does not recognize four-player chess in any form, and there are no official rules, so players are free to experiment with variations and make their own rules.&#10;&#10;See also:&#10;&#10;        Bughouse Chess&#10;        Vendetta&#10;&#10;&#10;";1881;5.96839;2.8889;2;4;45;8;Abstract Strategy, Children's Game;chess handed chess chess chess credit capt charles verney know document england chess probably exist hundred year prior verney form verney consist row add standard complete set chessman different color modern colored piece available manufacturer verney chess partnership object checkmate oppose partner time modern range partner cutthroat temporary alliance start configuration affect fairness bias standard configuration queen face queen bias chess axis symmetry chess require axis symmetry fair unbiased avoid bias verney recommend stare configuration queen light dark square unbiased starting configuration queen right left king chess follow follow normal chess verney special partnership disallow castling pawn enemy rank order exchange piece pawn march verney checkmate ultimate modern variation chess partnering require allowable castling allow actual capturing king require eliminate chess federation recognize chess form official free experiment variation bughouse chess vendetta
2175;Willi Wacker;"Willi Wacker, apparently, is the German name for comic-strip character Andy Capp, who provides the theme for this game. Players seek to play same-number or sequential-number sets of cards from their hands to the table (the cards are numbered 1-8).

2179;Musketeers;"From the rules overview: &quot;In the Queen&rsquo;s service, the Musketeers are trying to acquire three valuable gems. However, the Cardinal and his dreaded Guards are out to sabotage the Musketeers&rsquo; mission. Many skirmishes between the Musketeers and the Guards ensue. The most successful Musketeers will be awarded gems. Those who fail will be sent to prison and will remain empty handed.&quot;&#10;&#10;Setup: remove some specific cards depending on the number of players. Shuffle and place all Guard cards in the center, along with the Gem and Prison cards. Shuffle the Musketeer cards and deal 12 each.&#10;&#10;Play: players select 3 cards to place face down; these are their potential rewards (Pay cards) this fight. Reveal the top Guard. Players simultaneously select a card, then reveal. If the sum is lower than the Guard strength, the player playing the lowest card places a Prison card on one of his Pay cards. Otherwise, the player with the highest card either places a Gem card on one of his Pay cards, or returns one of his Prison cards to the center. If center area doesn't have a card you need, take it from another player. If all you have 3 Prison cards, your played card doesn't add to the other players' cards.&#10;&#10;The round ends after 9 fights. Players earn silver for their Pay cards, doubled if a Gem is on top and reduced to 0 if a Prison is on top. The player with the most coins wins. Alternatively, keep playing rounds till someone gets 100 or more points, and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;";1991;6.08045;1.1071;2;4;40;8;Bluffing, Card Game;overview queen rsquo service musketeer try acquire valuable gem cardinal dreaded guard sabotage musketeer rsquo mission skirmish musketeer guard ensue successful musketeer award gem fail send prison remain handed remove specific card depend number shuffle place guard card center gem prison card shuffle musketeer card deal select card place face potential reward pay card fight reveal guard simultaneously select card reveal sum low guard strength low card place prison card pay card high card place gem card pay card return prison card center center area doesn t card need prison card card doesn t add card end fight earn silver pay card double gem reduce prison coin alternatively till get

2181;Bridge;"Bridge is a standard deck, trick taking card game that pits two partnerships against each other. The first part of the game is the auction, by which partners attempt to communicate information about their hands by bidding, in order to arrive at a successful contract. The contract specifies how many tricks must be taken by the team that wins the bid. After the auction, a member of the team that won the bid tries to win as many tricks as possible while playing both hands from the partnership. One hand is played normally while the other (the &quot;dummy hand&quot;) is placed face-up on the table, allowing for greater control. The defenders attempt to take enough tricks to make the contract fail.&#10;&#10;The formal name of the game is Contract Bridge, but the shortened name &quot;Bridge&quot; is the most common usage. Bridge developed from the 17th Century card game Whist. The earliest form of Bridge originated in 1886 when rules were introduced allowing the dealer to choose a trump and their partner's hand to become dummy. Bridge became Auction Bridge in 1904, which allowed the trump suit to be decided by the highest bidding partnership. Harold Vanderbilt transformed Auction Bridge into Contract Bridge in 1925, when he introduced an improved method of scoring.&#10;&#10;The duplicate version of the game has many pairs of partners, each playing the same hands separately and comparing their results. This method removes the element of luck in getting good cards when comparing players and thus helps to isolate the role of skill in the game.&#10;&#10;";1925;7.46137;3.8927;4;4;60;12;Card Game;bridge standard deck trick take card pit partnership auction partner attempt communicate information hand bid order arrive successful contract contract specify trick take team bid auction member team bid try trick possible hand partnership hand normally dummy hand place face table allow great defender attempt trick contract fail formal contract bridge shorten bridge common usage bridge develop th century card whist early form bridge originate introduce allow dealer choose trump partner hand dummy bridge auction bridge allow trump suit decide high bidding partnership harold vanderbilt transform auction bridge contract bridge introduce improved method duplicate pair partner hand separately compare result method remove element luck get good card compare help isolate role skill

To increase profits, the contractors try to use the cheap materials in place of the expensive stone materials. Beware the building inspectors, whose job it is to assure that safe buildings are constructed. If a builder gets caught Pfusch-ing (deliberately bungling the construction), he loses the building under construction.

2190;Star Trek: The Card Game;"This CCG is based on the original series. Each player plays with the same core crew cards in the middle of the table. These cards, Kirk, Spock, McCoy and the Enterprise, are in every starter. This is a blessing in that most CCG's make the most popular characters very rare.&#10;&#10;The game can be multi-player but is designed for and best with only two players.  Each player takes turns being the &quot;Current Player&quot;: the crew of the Enterprise, while the opposing player represents the obstacles to the crew as the &quot;Challenging Player&quot;.&#10;&#10;The game revolves around completing episodes as the Current Player. Each episode is made up of three cards, Mission, Plot and Discovery. You have all three cards in a generic form that you can play if you did not draw one of the types.&#10;&#10;You play a mission card then the opponent plays challenges against it. You then play a plot card and more challenges. Then a discovery card and yep, more challenges (well&hellip; really you just resolve any outstanding challenges). At the end each side gets points called XC for how they did or did not do during the Episode phase.  The Current player gets XC for completing the episode while the Challenger gets XC for stifling the Current Player's efforts.&#10;&#10;XC is put on the core crew and crew you enter on your side and the first player to end their turn with 25+ XC total on the crew wins. This means that XC on the core crew will count for each side when it is their turn.&#10;&#10;The shots from the series used on the cards will make Star Trek fans very happy. My favorite card - Shirtless Kirk.&#10;&#10;There is also an expansion for this game.

Food Fight is a quite detailed, &quot;wargame representation&quot; of a school cafeteria food fight.&#10;&#10;The players control a student each with an action point allowance and an appearance rating which determine how much food he can absorb before being out. Characters that are better at attacking generally also have a lower threshold for absorbing damage. There are also 6 staff members who try to apprehend the students.&#10;&#10;The game also has details for multiple types of foods with various ratings for each projectile's: range, slipperiness (used when they land on the floor), to-hit values and damage numbers. All results are determined with a simple d6 roll and you can even send an entire tray flying with or without food and cafeteria tables may be flipped over for even more mayhem.&#10;&#10;The advanced game adds a lot to the game. The combat chart lists 30 food types each with 3 different attack modes and 7 ratings for each. There is an accuracy modification chart included.

2201;Redemption;"Redemption(&trade;) is a Bible-based collectible card game (CCG). Created in 1995 by Rob Anderson of Cactus Game Design Inc. as a Christian faith alternative to Magic the Gathering, Redemption (&trade;) is the 2nd-longest running CCG in existence (after Magic). As of 2023, 6 starter sets and 24 expansion sets have been released, along with many promotional cards. There are over 4500 unique Redemption cards in print - including variants and reprints.&#10;&#10;For all of the impressive numbers, what is even more impressive is that every single Redemption card is based on a character, event, or concept from the Bible and has its own identifying Bible verse(s). Moreover, most cards&rsquo; special abilities tie directly into their verse&rsquo;s meaning or topic.&#10;&#10;Going further - the game is a simple-to-learn, complex-to-master strategy game. Unlike most other CCGs, it is 2-sided: each player plays offense and defense, and will build each into their customized deck.&#10;&#10;So how do you play? In a nutshell, the first player to rescue 5 lost souls (in &ldquo;Type 1&rdquo; format, or 7 Lost Souls in Type 2 format) is the winner. Lost Souls are rescued by using Heroes on offense, and strategically overcoming your opponent&rsquo;s defensive villains, called Evil Characters. Each time you do that, you rescue 1 Lost Soul card, and the turn is passed for your opponent to play offense with their Heroes and against your defensive Evil Characters. Hundreds of unique special abilities create endless play combinations and deep strategy, for extremely high replay value for the game. Once you get into Redemption, you&rsquo;ll always enjoy tweaking - or completely scrapping and starting over - decks, acquiring new cards, trying new strategies, and testing yourself against opponents in casual and tournament settings.&#10;&#10;Speaking of tournaments, every year there is a long tournament season, filled with local, district, state, and regional tournaments, as well as a national tournament, that anyone can attend. The national tournament, known within the community as &quot;Nationals&quot;, is usually hosted in the summer months of July or August. This event is a 3 day tournament where every legal category is played to determine a National Champion of that category for the year. Also, at this point, the annual ranking system for players which awards points for top 3 finishes in sanctioned tournaments throughout the year is finalized and the winners are announced. All National winners and winners of a category in the annual ranking system for a category receive special National Winner Promos. These are some of the coolest looking cards in the game and are highly sought after as playable collectibles.&#10;&#10;Though of course far from perfect, being a Christian game in which most players who play are Christians, there is also a wonderful community that has been established over the past 25 years. So many players are welcoming and encouraging to newcomers and veterans alike, and there is an online message board and Discord channel in which conversation goes on daily. This is a community in which players feel just as natural about asking a strategy question about the game as sharing a personal prayer topic - trusting that they will be treated with respect and care no matter what. This active community of Redemption players, which includes the team of Elders (the game's leadership group), have really worked hard to make it about as easy to join the game as can be. There are tremendous community driven resources to provide plenty of engagement with new and active players alike. In addition to the message boards and Discord, the game has an active subreddit, a blog site with contributions from the broad community of players, active Youtubers and even two podcasts - One a weekly source of content spanning various topics of the game and the other a biweekly dive into high level competitive gameplay.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.10428;2.5625;2;5;30;7;Card Game, Collectible Components, Religious;redemption trade bible base collectible card ccg create rob anderson cactus inc christian faith alternative magic gathering redemption trade nd long running ccg existence magic starter set set release promotional card unique redemption card print include reprint impressive number impressive single redemption card base character event concept bible identify bible verse card rsquo special tie directly verse rsquo meaning topic go simple learn complex master strategy unlike ccgs side offense defense build customize deck nutshell rescue soul ldquo rdquo format soul format winner soul rescue hero offense strategically overcome opponent rsquo defensive villain call evil character time rescue soul card pass opponent offense hero defensive evil character hundred unique special create endless combination deep strategy extremely high replay value redemption rsquo ll enjoy tweak completely scrap start deck acquire new card try new strategy test opponent casual tournament setting speak tournament year long tournament season fill local district state regional tournament national tournament attend national tournament know community national usually host summer month july august event day tournament legal category determine national champion category year annual rank award finish sanction tournament year finalize winner announce national winner winner category annual rank category receive special national winner promo cool look card highly seek playable collectible course far perfect christian christian wonderful community establish past year welcome encouraging newcomer veteran alike online message discord channel conversation go daily community feel natural ask strategy question share personal prayer topic trust treat respect care matter active community redemption include team elder leadership group work hard easy join tremendous community drive resource provide plenty engagement new active alike addition message discord active subreddit blog site contribution broad community active youtuber podcast weekly source content span topic biweekly dive high competitive

To start the game you place 3 pieces on each of your first 4 rows. You pick a row and move all pieces in it, dropping one piece off at every row you pass. If your last piece comes to rest in a row with other of your pieces you may pick them up and move with them also. Upon getting a pawn to the middle pit you drop one in and start placing the pieces starting along row one again. If your last piece ends in a row that an opponent has a single piece in you capture it and place it in your prisoner pit. If more then one opponent has a single piece in the last row you place in you capture all of them.&#10;&#10;When one player has no pieces left, through dropping them in the middle pit or being captured, the game is over.

2205;The Lost World Jurassic Park Game;"Based on the second movie, of course. This tri-lingual (English, Spanish, French) crowded MB box contains a whole bunch of thin cardboard 3D buildings; stand up cardboard pieces for the 12 humans and the helicopter, and a bunch of plastic miniatures of the dinosaurs (a T-Rex and some Velociraptors). This is played in teams, the human team trying to get 3 humans off the board via the chopper, and the dinosaur team trying to prevent this. When 3 play, the third player alternates teams.&#10;&#10;The humans can jump between building roofs or can run between them. Unfortunately, the dinosaurs move a lot faster on the ground than the humans (the humans move between marked spaces, the dinosaurs between zones). Buildings have several entry/exit points for the humans but only one for the raptors. Dice indicate how to move humans and dinosaurs; one of the dice has Stop/Go markings which control whether you may roll again or not --making movement harder to predict. Jumping (for humans) and entering buildings (for dinosaurs) is also dice controlled. The T-Rex is confined to a single board edge area; its function is to flush the humans from the starting building -- once he reaches it, all remaining humans are devoured!&#10;&#10;Yes, unlike the first movie game, in this one there is death aplenty. As soon as a dinosaur enters a space with humans in it, even when just passing through, they're all eaten. Tastes like chicken.&#10;&#10;An alternate game consists of two plays, with teams switching allegiance.

There are some safe spaces on the board (maintenance sheds) that allow you to refresh your hand of cards as a bonus. Cards allow you to move, move faster along the road, escape a dinosaur or cancel another player's card. On your turn, you roll dice that indicate which dinosaur you may move. You then move yourself one space, play a card or trade in cards. The dinosaurs don't kill anyone (unlike in the movie!) -- they just pin you down until the dinosaur is moved away or an escape card is played.&#10;&#10;Although the box says 2-4 players, there are pieces for up to 8, which leads to a lot more mayhem (but a longer game).&#10;&#10;";1993;5.26743;1.4167;2;8;60;8;Animals, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Racing, Science Fiction;base movie course huge milton bradley box contain sized flimsy visitor center building stand cardboard piece movie character bunch plastic miniature dangerous dinosaur t rex velociraptor dilophosaurus start end island try visitor center safe space maintenance shed allow refresh hand card bonus card allow fast road escape dinosaur cancel card dice indicate dinosaur space card trade card dinosaur don t kill unlike movie pin dinosaur away escape card box say piece lead lot mayhem long

2212;eBay Electronic Talking Auction Game;"Players use cards to bid on various items that might come up for sale on eBay. An electronic gizmo determines turn order and decides when a particular auction is over. Players only have a few seconds to place a bid when their color is called by the gizmo or a buzzer will sound and bidding moves to another player. Items up for bid are shown with an estimated value. The real value of the item can be higher or lower and known only when a player actually wins the bidding on that item. Players can double-score items if they can get a collection of three or more items of the same color/category. The game gizmo requires 3 AAA batteries (not included).&#10;&#10;";2001;5.95022;1.2581;3;4;20;10;Card Game, Electronic;use card bid item come sale ebay electronic gizmo determine order decide particular auction second place bid color call gizmo buzzer sound bid item bid show estimate value real value item high low know actually bidding item double item item color category gizmo require aaa battery include

Each player takes a heroic figure and attempts to perform deeds that will generate enough glory to ensure that the hero's memory will live in the sagas composed after his or her death.&#10;&#10;To gain glory, the heros slay monsters, accumulate treasure hoards, recruit lesser heros (&quot;jarls&quot;, or earls) as their companions, and establish kingdoms.  The hero who gains the most glory is the one whose fame will live on in the sagas, while the others are doomed to be forgotten by posterity.

2215;They've Invaded Pleasantville;"Part of TSR's minigame series.  From the rulebook...&#10;&#10;&quot;They've Invaded Pleasantville&quot; minigame is a two player wargame of secret invasion by Space Invaders.  One player, the Alien player, moves the Alien-controlled and uncontrolled pieces, and the other player, the Town player, moves the Town-controlled pieces.  There are 12 game turns in this game. In any given turn, playing pieces representing various townspeople will be moved across the gamemap, which is a map of Pleasantville.&#10;&#10;The Alien player will try to keep the whereabouts of the Alien-controlled townspeople a secret, while he or she &quot;takes over&quot; more unsuspecting townspeople and builds up strength for the final showdown with the Town player.  The Alien player, in short, will try to create a large army of townspeople-zombies, eliminate any opposition, and occupy Pleasantville as a base of operations.  The Town player will try to convince the townspeople that there is an alien menace in the town, and will attempt to fight any Alien-controlled townspeople encountered.  With luck and careful play, the Town player hopes to defeat the Alien-controlled&quot;zombies&quot;, locate the Alien Headquarters, and destroy the Alien Sub-Commander.&#10;&#10;The game mechanic involves use of two identical sets of carboard chits - one set having a star on the back indicating alien control. Each turn, the alien player may use misdirection and bluffing to fool the town player as to where the alien mind control is taking place. Real townspeople are &quot;swapped out&quot; with alien controlled ones and the town player must stop the spread of control sooner than later. A fun game for two players who enjoy bluffing and like simulating the action of classic movies like Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Invaders from Mars. Especially entertaining is the random Townsperson Movement table that simulates the day to day migration of unsuspecting townspeople as they go about their business in Pleasantville.&#10;&#10;";1981;6.08328;2.1111;2;2;45;12;Horror, Science Fiction;tsr minigame series rulebook ve invade pleasantville minigame wargame secret invasion space invader alien alien uncontrolle piece town town piece give piece represent townspeople gamemap map pleasantville alien try whereabouts alien townspeople secret take unsuspecting townspeople build strength final showdown town alien short try create large army townspeople zombie eliminate opposition occupy pleasantville base operation town try convince townspeople alien menace town attempt fight alien townspeople encounter luck careful town hope defeat alien zombie locate alien headquarters destroy alien sub commander involve use identical set carboard chit set have star indicate alien alien use misdirection bluff fool town alien mind take place real townspeople swap alien one town stop spread soon later fun enjoy bluff like simulate action classic movie like invasion body snatcher invader mar especially entertaining random townsperson table simulate day day migration unsuspecting townspeople business pleasantville
2216;Vampyre;"Part of TSR's minigame series. From the rulebook...&#10;&#10;&quot;The Vampyre game is faithful to Stoker's original novel. It may be played by up to 6 people, each playing the role of one of Stoker's characters. Many of the game elements are also derived from the book. In Stoker's novel, Dracula did indeed hide coffins in various secret locations so that he would always have a place to hide during the day, should his principle (sic?) lair be discovered. Dracula did have vampire brides and could command wolves, rats, bears and other supernatural beings. Effective against these un-dead creatures were The Host, holy water, crucifixes and silver bullets; not to mention the hammer and stake - tools required for dispatching vampires.&#10;&#10;The Vampyre basic game takes place on the map of Transylvania. The game is a race between the vampire hunters to see who will be the first to find and destroy three of Count Dracula's hidden coffins.&#10;&#10;The extended game is played on the reverse side of the map, Dracula's Castle, after the players have finished the basic game. Here, the players have already destroyed Dracula's hidden coffins. Now they must track down and destroy the Count himself in his heavily guarded lair.&quot;&#10;&#10;";1981;6.27264;1.5;2;6;45;12;Exploration, Horror, Post-Napoleonic;tsr minigame series rulebook vampyre faithful stoker original novel people role stoker character element derive book stoker novel dracula hide coffin secret location place hide day principle sic lair discover dracula vampire bride command wolf rat bear supernatural being effective un dead creature host holy water crucifix silver bullet mention hammer stake tool require dispatch vampire vampyre basic take place map transylvania race vampire hunter find destroy count dracula hide coffin extended reverse map dracula castle finish basic destroy dracula hide coffin track destroy count heavily guard lair

What's your selling style?&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to make money.  You do this by renting spaces and selling your Big Deal cards.  Once a player has sold all of his Big Deal cards, it's Closing Time --any Big Deal cards leftover in other players' hands are deducted from their score.&#10;&#10;Big Deal cards are displayed for all to see during play, with the Fair Price hidden on the back.  There are duplicates of each item, with sometimes wildly different fair prices.  Sets of four Big Deal cards of the same colour can be cashed in when passing the Wholesaler (Start Space).  You bargain for Big Deal cards when you land on a seller's space.  Only two offers and two counter-offers are allowed, to limit bargaining time.  The agreed-upon price is multiplied by the number of cards of that colour the buyer already holds (but never more than four times).&#10;&#10;If you think the seller was asking for more than the Fair Price, you may call a Challenge.  You are secretly shown the Fair Price to resolve the challenge.

2230;Ayanu;"This game is 'Chess-like' in many ways: two players have identical sets of game pieces starting on opposite sides of a square grid. Players move one piece per turn and can eliminate the other player's pieces by moving into their space. Movement options depend on which piece it is you're moving. In a fit of conspicuous difference, it's the black side who makes the opening move here.&#10;&#10;The central gimmick is that each piece is composed of two parts, a body and a head. The height of the body determines how far a piece can move (one, two or three spaces), whereas the head determines the directions: straight lines (like rooks), diagonals (like bishops), or both (like kings or queens). Each side also has one super-powered queen/rook hybrid which can move to any space within the range determined by its body, and even one unbeatable but immobile head.&#10;&#10;There's a reason for all this separation into bodies and heads: after every move the piece which just moved must swap heads with a different type of head, chosen by the player from their pieces still in play.&#10;&#10;There are two victory conditions: either you move one of your pieces to a specific target square on the far side of the board, or you force your opponent to make an illegal move. Draws are possible, but rare (they require both sides' forces to be extremely depleted).&#10;&#10;The theme is pretty much irrelevant - this is an abstract at heart. The rulebook frames the game as the secret strategy-honing tool of the nobles in a fictional culture, and the rules introduction is presented in dialogue form with the Wise Old Master teaching the game to his Young Noble Student, but none of this is at all relevant to gameplay. In fact, the game presented within the fiction is themeless and, quite literally, abstract: the pieces' names are translated as abstract concepts like 'strength' etc.&#10;&#10;";1987;7.02453;2.2857;2;2;30;10;Abstract Strategy;chess like way identical set piece start opposite side square grid piece eliminate piece space option depend piece fit conspicuous difference black make opening central gimmick piece compose part body head height body determine far piece space head determine direction straight line like rook diagonal like bishop like king queen super power queen rook hybrid space range determine body unbeatable immobile head reason separation body head piece swap head different head choose piece condition piece specific target square far force opponent illegal draw possible rare require side force extremely deplete pretty irrelevant abstract heart rulebook frame secret strategy hone tool noble fictional culture introduction present dialogue form wise old master teach young noble student relevant fact present fiction themeless literally abstract piece name translate abstract concept like strength etc

2236;Streets of Stalingrad;"&quot;Streets of Stalingrad&quot; is a World War 2 East Front wargame that models the fight for the city of Stalingrad, September-October, 1942, at the company level. It employs a scale of 300 meters per hex, with daily turns and 2160 counters.&#10;&#10;The two designers spent years researching the orders of battle and aerial maps to produce a game that is possibly the most researched and arguably the most accurate depiction of a battle, mechanics aside.&#10;&#10;The large, fairly thin but sturdy counters are the shades of the uniforms of the armies according to the designers. Instead of the usual American style designations on the counters to depict what type of unit it is, the designers used the actual designations used by the separate armies. This could be confusing except for the wonderful large player aids supplied with actual photos of the unit types. Labels and ziplock bag are even supplied for sorting purposes although sorting can be confusing. Moves mag put out an issue in the late '70's, early '80's with an article that fixed the problem.&#10;&#10;The 3 large maps are taken straight from aerial photos. You see the city block by block and outside the city individual buildings can even be seen. There is very little color on the maps but they are beautiful and very functional. The terrain effects chart once again has actual photos of the terrain so you can get an idea of exactly what the soldiers were facing.&#10;&#10;There are many scenarios available so you can tailor the game for time and room as some only use 1 map or a portion of a map. Each scenario has a separate set up sheet for both sides that are large enough to put all the counters on the sheets. Each scenario has a miniature version of the map to be used with set up information. For a monster game it is very easy to set up and get into a game.&#10;&#10;There are 3 rulebooks included, 2 basic game and 1 advanced game. When learning the game it is fantastic that they included a rulebook for each player. This is the kind of detail that is evident throughout the game. The rule books are detailed without being overbearing, as a lot of Avalon Hill's and SPI's were from the time period. They are chock full of examples to clear up ambiguities.&#10;&#10;The game is difficult because of the scale only. It is actually a fairly simple game, mechanics wise, and can be played by anyone with some wargame experience. This game shows that it has been designed to play, by wargamers, in every detail.&#10;&#10;";1979;7.61377;4.2727;2;2;180;12;Wargame, World War II;street stalingrad world war east wargame model fight city stalingrad september october company employ scale meter hex daily designer spend year research order battle aerial map produce possibly researched arguably accurate depiction battle aside large fairly thin sturdy shade uniform army accord designer instead usual american style designation depict unit designer actual designation separate army confusing wonderful large aid supply actual photo unit label ziplock bag supply sort purpose sort confuse mag issue late early article fix problem large map take straight aerial photo city block block outside city individual building see little color map beautiful functional terrain effect chart actual photo terrain idea exactly soldier face available tailor time room use map portion map separate set sheet side large sheet miniature map set information monster easy set rulebook include basic advanced learn fantastic include rulebook kind detail evident book detail overbearing lot avalon hill spi time period chock example clear ambiguity difficult scale actually fairly simple wise wargame experience show wargamer detail

2247;Zero!: The Rise and Fall of The Imperial Japanese Air Force Dec 1941 - June 1942;"(from the GMT Website:)&#10;&#10;Volume III in the Down in Flames card game series moves to the Pacific Theatre of Operations in WWII. Players will recreate the first six months of furious aerial combat between the might of Imperial Japan and the surprised forces of the United Kingdom and the United States.&#10;&#10;Zero! includes the important early-war fighters and bomber of the Imperial Japanese Navy and Army, Royal Air Force, United States Navy, United States Army Air Force, and the American Volunteer Group (the famous Flying Tigers). Fly the fearsome A6M2 Zero against the F4F Wildcat, Hawker Hurricane IIb, Curtiss P-40B and E Tomahawks, and the ill-fated Brewster Buffalo. As a pilot with the Japanese Army, take Ki-27 Nates and Ki-43 Oscars to the skies against the Allies over Malaya and Burma. Match your skills with American aces Wagner, Thach, McCuskey or their semi-mercenary countrymen of the AVG, Hill and Newkirk. The Japanese can counter with Sakai, Anabuki, Kato, and more.&#10;&#10;As with the previous games in the series, Zero! includes the Campaigns covering the major aerial events of the December 1941 to June 1942 period. Each consists of multiple missions aimed at a variety of targets, for which you must wisely allocate your resources of men and material. New to Zero! are Carrier Campaigns, which give players some control over the carrier groups their naval squadrons fly from. Do you go all out for a decisive strike or hold your fighters back and let the enemy overextend himself? Campaigns included in this volume are: Pearl Harbor (solitaire), the Philippines, Malaya, Burma, Coral Sea, and Midway.&#10;&#10;Both Down in Flames veterans and newcomers to the series will enjoy this latest volume. All the components needed to play are included - ownership of the first two volumes is not necessary, but the three games are completely compatible. Beautiful, newly-designed, full-color action cards drive gameplay, while cards representing the major aircraft of the period and counters of the famous aces allow players to explore a wide range of scenarios. Besides the new Carrier Campaigns, historically significant missions have been added to the standard campaigns and the rules have been updated and expanded.&#10;&#10;Are you ready to relive history? Can you sweep the skies in the cockpit of the Zero, delaying or even stopping the appearance of American industrial might? Or will the Allies, in their outdated machines, halt the Japanese onslaught much earlier?&#10;&#10;CONTENTS:    &#10;&#10;     88 full-color, die-cut counters.&#10;     150 full-color Playing Cards&#10;     6 Campaign Map Displays&#10;     One Bombing Display&#10;     One Resource Sheet&#10;     One 16-page Rulebook&#10;     One 20-page Campaign Booklet&#10;     8 Target Displays&#10;     Three Campaign Logs &#10;&#10;&#10;Designed by Dan Verssen&#10;Developed by Mike Lemick&#10;&#10;";2001;6.95177;2.2857;2;10;60;12;Aviation / Flight, Card Game, Wargame, World War II;gmt website volume iii flame card series pacific theatre operation wwii recreate month furious aerial combat imperial japan surprised force united kingdom united states zero include important early war fighter bomber imperial japanese navy army royal air force united states navy united states army air force american volunteer group famous fly tiger fly fearsome m zero f f wildcat hawker hurricane iib curtiss p b e tomahawk ill fate brewster buffalo pilot japanese army ki nate ki oscar sky ally malaya burma match skill american ace wagner thach mccuskey semi mercenary countryman avg hill newkirk japanese sakai anabuki kato previous series zero include campaign cover major aerial event december june period consist multiple mission aim variety target wisely allocate resource man material new zero carrier campaign carrier group naval squadron fly decisive strike hold fighter let enemy overextend campaign include volume pearl harbor solitaire philippines malaya burma coral sea midway flame veteran newcomer series enjoy late volume component need include ownership volume necessary completely compatible beautiful newly color action card drive card represent major aircraft period famous ace allow explore wide range new carrier campaign historically significant mission add standard campaign update expand ready relive history sweep sky cockpit zero delaying stop appearance american industrial ally outdated machine halt japanese onslaught early content color die cut color playing card campaign map display bombing display resource sheet page rulebook page campaign booklet target display campaign log dan verssen develop mike lemick
2248;Leverage;"Leverage is an exciting board game of strategy with a unique action feature; it includes various weighted pieces and is built around universal laws of balance and force. Leverage has been hailed as a favorite of GAMES MAGAZINE in 4 different years.&#10;&#10;Rules and game pieces are simple and easy to understand, yet tactics and strategy can be as sophisticated and challenging as the players themselves. Two opposing strategies (speed &amp; sacrifice vs. conservation &amp; mass force) provide intrigue and depth, as either may be merged into the other as the game unfolds.&#10;&#10;Constant action potential -- Jump, capture, sacrifice, block; and, the players may rock the board at any time to see how the leverage advantage is changing.&#10;&#10;Suspense -- The board always stabilizes at a level position until a move is made that tilts it down to rest at one end; there is no halfway tilt!  When the board tilts down, scoring pegs are removed until it returns to level.&#10;&#10;The winner is (1)the one who tilts the board down towards his opponent when the opponent has no scoring pegs left to remove, or (2)the one who moves all of his remaining playing pieces into the opposite Safety Zone while having more or an equal number of scoring pegs than his opponent.&#10;&#10;";1977;6.25;1.7895;2;2;30;10;Abstract Strategy;leverage exciting strategy unique action include weighted piece build universal law balance force leverage hail favorite magazine different year piece simple easy understand tactic strategy sophisticated challenging oppose strategy speed amp sacrifice vs conservation amp mass force provide intrigue depth merge unfold constant action potential jump capture sacrifice block rock time leverage advantage change suspense stabilize position tilt rest end halfway tilt tilt peg remove return winner tilt opponent opponent peg leave remove remain playing piece opposite safety zone have equal number peg opponent
2249;The Sinking of the Titanic;"The Titanic is sinking. Players must race around and rescue passengers from their state rooms and rush to the lifeboats before the ship sinks. After the ship sinks, you must get enough of food and water by visiting islands and/or drawing cards to stay alive until the rescue boat appears and the first one to make it there wins the game.

2250;Midway;"The basic idea is each player has his or her own map of the area (in this case the Midway Island) behind a screen. Each player &quot;searches&quot; for the enemy fleet by flying search planes to the various zones on the map and calling the zone co-ordinates. Once found, bombers can be sent in to sink the enemy fleet. The actual attack is fought on a separate battle board where the ships are first placed on a rectangular grid and the attacking planes are placed in adjacent rectangles or on top of the ships themselves to indicate which ship they are attacking.&#10;&#10;The basic game is very simple, but there are a number of additional rules which add realism and complexity: CAP fighters, surface actions, anvil and wave attacks, etc.&#10;&#10;The game is superior with a neutral referee for true double blind play.&#10;&#10;Developed with the technical aid of C.

2251;Strat-O-Matic Baseball;"An iconic major league baseball game that is so well known that it is exhibited in the National Baseball Hall of Fame. The game is conducted with pitcher and batter cards constructed with statistical probabilities so they realistically reproduce the real-life performance of each player for the season represented.  The gamer is placed in the role of the manager and/or general manager of a team and controls the batting order, the choice of a starting pitcher, game strategies (hit and run, steals, intentional walks, bunting, positioning of infielders, pinch hitters, defensive substitutions, pitching changes, etc.).  If a full season is played, the game produces amazingly realistic statistics at the player, team, and league levels.  The game comes in two versions: a cards and dice version that has been around since 1962 and a computer version that automatically looks up play outcomes and compiles player, team and league statistics.  Every year, Strat-O-Matic releases new player card sets based on the previous baseball season, seasons past, and some &quot;greats&quot; collections.&#10;&#10;";1962;7.84872;2.3853;1;2;45;11;Sports;iconic major league baseball know exhibit national baseball hall fame conduct pitcher batter card construct statistical probability realistically reproduce real life performance season represent gamer place role manager general manager team batting order start pitcher strategy hit run steal intentional walk bunting positioning infielder pinch hitter defensive substitution pitch change etc season produce amazingly realistic statistic team league come card dice computer automatically look outcome compile team league statistic year strat o matic release new card set base previous baseball season season past great
2252;King of the Tabletop;"Each player controls a kingdom made up of land tiles of different terrains (mountains, forest, etc), castles, settlements, and people and creatures.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to have a certain amount of prestige, judged by the size of one's kingdom, treasury, and the number of special heroic characters inhabiting the kingdom, as well as possession of a Grand Muniment (very large castle).&#10;&#10;This game was originally published in Dragon #77.

2253;Touring;"Touring is a card game with the theme of an automobile trip. Players are competing to be the first one to complete a prescribed set of mileage cards. In all versions of the game you need 16 mileage cards to win. From lowest to highest value cards, the required counts are 8, 4, 2 and 2. Other players will try to slow you down by playing cards against you which cause you to lose mileage cards, or to play &quot;problem&quot; cards which you must remove by playing a corresponding &quot;remedy&quot; card.&#10;&#10;The game can be played in partnership for the 4- and 6-player versions, with each partnership playing as a single driver.&#10;&#10;Touring was originally published in 1906 by the Touring Card Company, then sold by Wallie Dorr, and then later picked up by Parker Brothers in 1924. Winning Moves Games currently (2015) holds the trademark for and publishes Touring.  If the mechanics sound familiar, it is the inspiration for the game Mille Bornes, which has since become more popular.&#10;&#10;As driving technology improved, card names and depicted mileage values became outdated and were thus replaced with longer distances.  There are multiple sets of rules, which reflect these changes.  A recent edition added some card categories.&#10;&#10;The action card types are different between Touring and Mille Bornes. For example, Mille Bornes adds the &quot;protective&quot; cards, e.g. Emergency Vehicle which allows you to ignore speed limits. Thus in Mille Bornes a player has more decisions to make.&#10;&#10;See also:&#10;&#10;     The Lindy Flying Game - A 1927 Nucraft Toys version of Touring based on Charles Lindbergh's flight across the Atlantic.  &#10;     Lindy, the New Flying Game - 1927 Parker Brothers sequel where Touring card play has been themed on Charles Lindbergh's flight across the Atlantic.&#10;     Mille Bornes - A similar game to Touring, first published in 1954.&#10;     Wings: The Air Mail Game - Another &quot;flying&quot; game like Lindy, but card deck split into two parts with different colors.&#10;     Stap op - The Dutch adaptation (bikes!) of the classic game Touring, from 1950 and still published today.&#10;&#10;&#10;Stap op is the Dutch adaptation (bikes!) of the classic American game Touring (cars!).&#10;&#10;";1906;5.24024;1.2105;2;6;30;8;Card Game, Racing, Sports;touring card automobile trip compete complete prescribed set mileage card need mileage card low high value card require count try slow card cause mileage card problem card remove correspond remedy card partnership partnership single driver touring originally publish touring card company sell wallie dorr later pick parker brother currently hold trademark publish tour sound familiar inspiration mille borne popular drive technology improve card name depict mileage value outdated replace long distance multiple set reflect change recent add card category action card different touring mille borne example mille borne add protective card e g emergency vehicle allow ignore speed limit mille borne decision lindy fly nucraft toy touring base charles lindbergh flight atlantic lindy new fly parker brother sequel touring card charles lindbergh flight atlantic mille borne similar tour publish wing air mail fly like lindy card deck split part different color stap op dutch adaptation bike classic touring publish today stap op dutch adaptation bike classic american touring car

2255;Kartenschach;"Kartenschach is proposed as 16 Chess games in 1. They are all variations on Chess using cards to augment the game. All are for 2 players. Many of the games are pure strategy with no randomness, just like Chess itself; many of them have an element of luck; and many of them introduce other game elements into Chess, including bluffing, hand management, resource management, gambling, push-your-luck, trick-taking, auctions, etc. There is something here for everyone--including the serious Chess player.&#10;&#10;In every game, a player's possible moves are determined, to varying extents, by the cards available to that player. Sometimes, a king will appear to be threatened, but will actually be safe, if the attacking piece is unable to move. As such, check and checkmate have been removed from these games entirely; a player may willingly enter or stay &quot;in check.&quot; The goal of every game is simply to capture the opposing king.&#10;&#10;";2000;6.78462;2.0;2;2;60;12;Abstract Strategy, Card Game;kartenschach propose chess variation chess card augment pure strategy randomness like chess element luck introduce element chess include bluff hand management resource management gambling push luck trick take auction etc include chess possible determined vary extent card available king appear threaten actually safe attack piece unable check checkmate remove entirely willingly enter stay check simply capture oppose king

2259;Afrika Korps;"Afrika Korps is an easy and fun historical game of  Rommel&rsquo;s battles with the English in North Africa during WW2. One of the early Avalon Hill beginner war games.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;Ever since men began making weapons they have used them to create legends: in early 1941, when his conquest of Europe was embarrassed by the rout of his Italian allies in Africa, Hitler dispatched General Erwin Rommel to forestall a seemingly inevitable Axis defeat. Reorganizing the forces under his command as the Deutsches Afrika Korps (DAK), Rommel immediately launched the first of his legendary desert offensives.&#10;&#10;Now, the legend of &quot;The Desert Fox&quot; is recreated. From April 1941 through the climatic battle at El Alamein in later 1942. Afrika Korps simulates the mobile conflict between Rommel's Panzerarmee Afrika and the British Eighth Army defending Egypt and the Suez Canal. During each monthly game-turn, the initiative may switch from the Germany to the Allied player as both come to understand why Rommel called North Africa &quot;A tactician's paradise; a logistical officer's nightmare.&quot;&#10;&#10;A 2 on Avalon Hill's complexity scale of 1(low) to 10(high).

2266;Gobblet;"Gobblet is an abstract game played on a 4x4 grid with each of the two players having twelve pieces that can nest on top of one another to create three stacks of four pieces.&#10;&#10;Your goal in Gobblet is to place four of your pieces in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row. Your pieces start nested off the board. On a turn, you either play one exposed piece from your three off-the-board piles or move one piece on the board to any other spot on the board where it fits. A larger piece can cover any smaller piece. A piece being played from off the board may not cover an opponent's piece unless it's in a location where your opponent threatens to win with 3 pieces in a row.&#10;&#10;Your memory is tested as you try to remember whose piece one of your larger pieces is covering before you move it. As soon as a player has four pieces in a row, s/he wins &mdash; except in one case: If you lift your piece and reveal an opponent's piece that completes a four-in-a-row, you don't immediately lose; you can't return the piece to its starting location, but if you can place it over one of the opponent's three other pieces in that line, the game continues.&#10;&#10;_______________&#10;Similiar to : &#10;&#10;     Cover Up&#10;&#10;&#10;";2000;6.61802;1.8361;2;2;20;7;Abstract Strategy, Memory;gobblet abstract x grid have piece nest create piece gobblet place piece horizontal vertical diagonal row piece start nest expose piece pile piece spot fit large piece cover small piece piece cover opponent piece location opponent threaten piece row memory test try remember piece large piece cover soon piece row mdash case lift piece reveal opponent piece complete row don t immediately t return piece starting location place opponent piece line continue similiar cover

2271;Creeper;"Selection #4 of The Games Collection by Pin International.&#10;&#10;Creeper is an abstract strategy game which belongs in the same family as Hex/Twixt. That is, two players attempt to link two sides of the board with a chain of pieces.&#10;&#10;Players: 2 only. One plays black, the other white.&#10;The Bits:&#10;&#10;     16 pawns, 8 black and 8 white.&#10;     32 &quot;Othello&quot; disks, i.e. black one side and white on the other.&#10;     A board made up of a 6&times;6 square grid of octagons. &#10;&#10;&#10;The game: Although the spaces on the board are octagonal, the main playing pieces ( the pawns ) are placed and played in the squares that are formed where the corners of the octagons meet.&#10;On his/her turn, the player may move one of their 8 pawns.&#10;A move may consist of leaping diagonally over an octagon, or a simple move between one octagon and the next in a straight line, or finally a pawn may capture an opponents` pawn by jumping over it a la checkers/draughts.&#10;&#10;In the first case, if a pawn makes the diagonal jump one of two actions may take place: if the octagon is empty, one of the disks is played inside it, with the players` colour uppermost. Alternatively, if the octagon is occupied by an opponents` disk, this disk is flipped over to show the opposite side (and therefore colour). &#10;The winner is the first player to link two specific diagonally opposed corners ( black must link top left to bottom right and white top right to bottom left), with a continuous chain of their colour disks. Only orthogonal links count, not diagonal.&#10;&#10;&#10;";1995;6.53281;1.875;2;2;20;10;Abstract Strategy;selection pin international creeper abstract strategy belong family hex twixt attempt link side chain piece black white bit pawn black white othello disk e black white time square grid octagon space octagonal main playing piece pawn place square form corner octagon meet pawn consist leap diagonally octagon simple octagon straight line finally pawn capture opponent pawn jump la checker draught case pawn make diagonal jump action place octagon disk inside colour uppermost alternatively octagon occupy opponent disk disk opposite colour winner link specific diagonally oppose corner black link leave right white right leave continuous chain colour disk orthogonal link count diagonal

2273;Hopfen & Malz;"This db spiele game can be translated to &quot;Hops and Malt&quot; in English.  The goal of the game is to brew the best beer using ingredients associated with the German purity law:  Malt, hops, and water.  There is a card deck associated with each of these 3 ingredients:  a malt deck, a hops deck and a water deck.  Players have a limited amount of money to purchase ingredients for their beer.  Ingredients in each deck are valued from 1 (worst ingredients) to 6 (best ingredients).  The decks are shuffled separately and the 3 decks are placed face down in the table.  The top card of each deck is turned over.  In turn, each player may buy any of the 3 ingredients with their money.  This continues until all the ingredients are gone or the players run out of money.  Now, players sell their beer at market.  To make beer, you must have 1 hop card + 1 malt card + 1 water card.  The value of the beer is the sum of the value of the cards.  Contracts valued between 10 and 100 are turned over 1 at a time.  Players use once around bidding with their beer to buy the best contracts.  The total value of the contracts purchased determines the winning player.&#10;&#10;";1992;5.5;0.0;3;6;30;8;Card Game, Economic;db spiele translate hop malt english brew good beer ingredient associate german purity law malt hop water card deck associate ingredient malt deck hop deck water deck limited money purchase ingredient beer ingredient deck value bad ingredient good ingredient deck shuffle separately deck place face table card deck buy ingredient money continue ingredient go run money sell beer market beer hop card malt card water card value beer sum value card contract value time use bid beer buy good contract total value contract purchase determine
2275;Airlines;"Airlines, The Game of Airline Strategy (a.k.a. Airline Operations in the Age of Deregulation) is a game of airline operations and business in the 1990's. Players represent the Chief Operations and Marketing Officers of major American airlines, whose job is to fly the most passengers over a given period of time.&#10;&#10;There are two basic games in Airlines: the One-Year Quick Game which takes about 45 minutes to play and the Three-Year Game, which takes about two hours to play. The currency of the game is seats, seats are used to pay for everything. The game is card-based, with a small map to show distances between Major and Regional Airports. The cards consist of Major Airports, Regional Airports, various Aircrafts, airline Hubs (your airline), Gates, and varied Opportunity/Events cards. The Ops/Events cards may denote bad weather in a region (thus reducing number of seats for that round), strikes (which can played on another airline), Fuel Price Adjustments (which effect your maintenance fees paid with Seats), and even an Aircraft Incident card (which people outside the industry call &quot;crashes.&quot;)&#10;&#10;Airlines can be combined with the stand-alone game Airlines: United States Set 2.&#10;&#10;";1998;4.68243;2.0556;2;4;120;12;Aviation / Flight, Card Game, Economic;airline airline strategy k airline operation age deregulation airline operation business represent chief operation marketing officer major american airline job fly passenger give period time basic airline year quick take minute year take hour currency seat seat pay card base small map distance major regional airport card consist major airport regional airport aircraft airline hub airline gate varied opportunity event card op event card denote bad weather region reduce number seat strike airline fuel price adjustment effect maintenance fee pay seat aircraft incident card people outside industry crash airline combine stand airlines united states set
2277;Lose Your Shirt;"Fortunes change at a stroke in this exciting game of betting and bluffing! Play your cards right and you'll be on a winning streak --but give too much away and you'll find your opponent's horse piping you at the post. Tension's high from the instant the horses leave their starting stalls. You keep the horse you've backed secret until you judge the moment's right to reveal it --cunning players will push other horses forward to create a &quot;false scent&quot;, then try to come through the field with a last minute burst and take the race at the winning post. If you back for a place, you play safe...But the stakes will be low. If you try for a big win...You could lose your shirt! This exciting race game keeps everyone guessing --and trying-- till the very last moment, and whether you win or lose it will provide hours of fascinating family fun.&#10;&#10;Contents: Felt playing area, 42 horse movement cards, 12 betting indicator cards, money, six plastic horses in different colors, starting stalls and grandstand. In the Canadian edition, the felt became a standard board, and the starting stalls and grandstand are gone as they were just chrome (theme elements not employed in the game).&#10;&#10;For each of the eight races the cards are thoroughly shuffled and dealt out to each player. The different cards (5 per horse) advance each horse at various rates (2 to 4 spaces) in the race and there are also 12 cards that affect any horse in the race (backwards 2 or forward 3). Players secretly bet on a horse to either win or place (take first or second place); you can also bet the jackpot (which is made up of all losing bets from previous races), which is like betting for a win except the minimum stake is higher and the payout is handled differently. Betting on a horse actually means taking one of its movement cards out...until you decide to play it, revealing your bet --one of this game's numerous subtleties.&#10;&#10;During the race, the players play their horse cards in turn, maneuvering the horses as needed --horses have very limited sidestepping and could be blocked during the race. If a player &quot;loses his shirt&quot; i.e. goes broke, he just continues the game playing cards but not betting.&#10;&#10;It can be best described as a cross between Win, Place &amp; Show and Undercover (a.k.a.

2281;Pictionary;"Playing Pictionary may remind you of Charades, but with drawing on paper instead of acting out the answers.

When the answer is not designated &quot;All Play,&quot; one team simply tries to come up with the answer before the timer runs out, which is usually but not always possible thanks to the varying difficulty levels of the answers.  No great drawing talent is required; instead, players gain an edge if they have a good imagination when guessing, empathy for their team mates, and/or a general ability to communicate in restricted circumstances.  A board is provided, just to keep score on, which focuses the competition.

2295;AstÃ©rix et les Romains;"A simple game using the Asterix franchise. The players are racing to win a bet as to whom will collect the most Roman helmets. You move from the Roman camp (which gets you 3 cards) to the village and back until the deck is exhausted. There are obstacles in the way: Assurancetourix the Bard makes you flee back three spaces with his atrocious singing, and you trip over the menhirs, losing a card. A small Roman cohort can be hit to garner an extra card.&#10;&#10;When two players end up in the same space, there can be a tussle, with one card --picked randomly-- being swapped.

The prices offered by the ports change with each delivery, so you try to arrive when the price is high.  There is a lot of scope for blocking other ships and for bumping them back to their last port.&#10;So where does the Bermuda Triangle bit come in?  There is a &lsquo;mysterious cloud&rsquo; - a plastic construction raised from the board on a central column - which moves about the board and twists around above the ships. There are magnets on the underside of the cloud and on top of the ships, so ships can be picked up and moved or destroyed when the cloud passes over.  Each turn, a player moves a ship and the cloud - usually trying to protect their own ships and attack those of other players.&#10;&#10;";1975;5.63892;1.2222;2;4;30;8;Economic, Nautical, Transportation;description box bermuda triangle legendary area atlantic ocean dozen ship plane disappear explanation setting exciting suspense sinister mystery cloud hover weave sweep swallow ship pass home cargo fleet victim bermuda triangle intriguing vanish ship try run successful ship transport operation mysterious bermuda triangle track run port port die ship reach port deliver commodity require port price offer port change delivery try arrive price high lot scope block ship bump port bermuda triangle bit come lsquo mysterious cloud rsquo plastic construction raise central column twist ship magnet underside cloud ship ship pick destroy cloud pass ship cloud usually try protect ship attack

Each player starts as a Merchant Prince of a European Duchy, operating a bank or merchant company speculating in the silk trade.

2317;MÃ¼ckenstich;"M&uuml;ckenstich is a trick-taking card game with four suits, with each suit having cards numbered 1-12 (with two 12s) and three mosquitoes; a mosquito has no number but is the highest card in a suit.&#10;&#10;Each round, players start with a number of cards in hand, then discard two of those cards face down. For the most part, M&uuml;ckenstich follows traditional trick-taking rules. The active player lays down a card, then each other player follows by playing a single card, following suit, if possible. Whenever a mosquito is played, that player declares one color to be trump. (The game starts with no trump color.) A mosquito or 12 played later in the round is considered higher than one played earlier. Once all players have laid down a card, the highest trump card (if any) wins the trick; with no trump, the highest card in the suit led for the round wins the trick. Players keep track of tricks won, and the winner of a trick leads to the next trick.&#10;&#10;Once all tricks have been played, the single player with the fewest tricks names one suit to count double during scoring, then the single player with the most mosquitoes names one of the three remaining suits to be worthless. Then players tally their points: The first mosquito in a suit is worth -5 points, while all other mosquitos are worth 0. Suited cards are worth 0-2 depending on whether they are worthless, scored as normal, or doubled.&#10;&#10;After a number of rounds equal to the number of players (or twice as many rounds with three players), the player with the highest total score wins.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.71575;1.8;3;6;30;9;Card Game;m uuml ckenstich trick taking card suit suit have card number mosquito mosquito number high card suit start number card hand discard card face m uuml ckenstich follow traditional trick take active lay card follow single card follow suit possible mosquito declare color trump start trump color mosquito later consider high early lay card high trump card trick trump high card suit lead trick track trick winner trick lead trick trick single few trick name suit count double single mosquito name remain suit worthless tally mosquito suit worth mosquito worth suited card worth depend worthless normal double number equal number twice high total

2326;Pirate and Traveler;"From the 1936 Edition Rules:&#10;&#10;&quot;This is a Game of Travel, concluding with a Pirate fight.  It comprises a Game-Board, Travel-Cards, Four Travelers, and Spinner.  The Game-Board is a Map of the World.  The Travel-Cards indicate journeys to be made by the Travelers, and the distance to be traveled in each move is determined by spinning.  As the routes of travel are well-known railroad and steamship lines, the players acquire a knowledge of these, also the chief cities and ports and their principal articles of commerce...&quot;&#10;&#10;The game was first published by Milton Bradley in 1911.  Other known dates of publication include 1936, 1953, 1956, 1960 and (finally?) 1970.  The game was also published in Great Britain by Chad Valley in the 1960's.

2328;Starunner;"Starunner takes place in a balkanised galaxy; the Galaxy-wide Empire has fallen, and centuries later small empires have appeared all over.  The re-invented warp (hyperdrive) technology is crude and a little hazardous.  Power crystals are relics of the fallen empire, still impossible to create anew, and can be integrated into the engines and computer systems of the ships to make them much, much better performing.&#10;&#10;You are a power crystal smuggler, or Star Runner.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to be the first to smuggle six power crystals to the Para system.  As the locations of the crystals are unknown at the outset, you'll first need to accumulate Clues.  For every six clues, you find a crystal --that is, you roll to deploy one; although you're the only one who knows where it is, you still need to get there and back...&#10;&#10;There are three basic strategies: One At A Time, where you find and fetch each of the six crystals in sequence; All At Once, where you locate all six before attempting to retrieve them; and Piracy, where you lie in wait of those who have found crystals...&#10;&#10;";1985;4.0;3.0;1;6;120;12;Economic, Science Fiction;starunner take place balkanise galaxy galaxy wide empire fall century later small empire appear invent warp hyperdrive technology crude little hazardous power crystal relic fallen empire impossible create anew integrate engine computer ship well perform power crystal smuggler star runner object smuggle power crystal para location crystal unknown outset ll need accumulate clue clue find crystal deploy know need basic strategy time find fetch crystal sequence locate attempt retrieve piracy lie wait find crystal
2329;Energy Quest;"In Energy Quest, each player is the president of an energy corporation, developing energy sources so as to sell the output.  Two basic types of property are on the board: raw materials (coal, oil, etc.) and power sites, where energy can be produced (electric stations and the like).  World Oil Price will rise steadily if unpredictably as the game progresses, making some propositions profitable in the later stages.&#10;&#10;There are two sets of currency: dollars and kilowatt-hours (kWh).  You buy energy from a player when you land on his developed power site, but the real victory condition is accumulating kWh &quot;receipts&quot; whenever you land on your won power sites or pass &quot;Take Off&quot; (e.g. &quot;Go&quot;).  Money and property are not counted at the end, so you must gauge carefully how much money to invest in kWh receipts as the game goes on.&#10;&#10;";1977;5.5;0.0;2;6;120;0;Economic, Industry / Manufacturing;energy quest president energy corporation develop energy source sell output basic property raw material coal oil etc power site energy produce electric station like world oil price rise steadily unpredictably progress make proposition profitable later stage set currency dollar kilowatt hour kwh buy energy land develop power site real condition accumulate kwh receipt land won power site pass e g money property count end gauge carefully money invest kwh receipt go
2330;Medical Monopoly;"In Medical Monopoly, each player is a doctor with a hospital to run.  If you are successful in having the right supplies (medicines, organs, etc.) on hand and in diagnosing illnesses, your hospital fills up --the first player to fill his hospital with patients wins.&#10;&#10;Oddly enough, this victory condition isn't clearly stated in the rules.  The game has elements of a Trivia game to it, as you must often recognize an illness from a list of symptoms and remember the appropriate cure (if any).  This lowers the replay value somewhat, but the game does have an educational vocation, so this is excusable.&#10;&#10;";1979;4.83333;1.0;2;4;90;8;Economic, Medical, Trivia;medical monopoly doctor hospital run successful have right supply medicine organ etc hand diagnose illnesse hospital fill fill hospital patient oddly condition isn t clearly state element trivia recognize illness list symptom remember appropriate cure lower replay value somewhat educational vocation excusable
2331;Spill and Spell;"Spill and Spell was originally published by Phillips. Parker Bros. also published this game.&#10;&#10;It is a word dice game where players make words to score points. Scoring is determined by squaring the number of letters in the words spelled (e.g. making a 3 letter word and a 4 letter word would net 25 (9+16)) and subtracting the square of unused letters.&#10;&#10;The 2003 Endless Games edition includes 22 letter cubes and is scored differently, assigning a point value to each letter based upon the length of the word it is part of, with crossed words scoring the shared letter twice, possibly with two different values.&#10;&#10;";1956;5.25842;1.2632;1;10;20;8;Dice, Party Game, Word Game;spill spell originally publish phillip parker bros publish word dice word determine square number letter word spell e g make letter word letter word net subtract square unused letter endless games include letter cube differently assign value letter base length word cross word share letter twice possibly different value

2335;Rome & Carthage;"Rome &amp; Carthage is a wargame set around the Mediterranean Sea. Each player controls one of four empires based in the cities Rome, Carthage, Constantinople, and Alexandria, and your goal is to occupy the other capitals and destroy your opponents' pieces on both land and sea.&#10;&#10;Each player controls different armies consisting of footmen, cavalry, elephants and galleys, each of which has different movement rules. In combat, each player plays two cards from his hand, with cards coming from a standard 52-card deck. Different units have different powers; the elephant, for example, doubles a player's highest card while the cavalry doubles his lowest one. Certain combinations of cards allow for special actions, such as seeing what your opponent plays before laying down your own cards.&#10;&#10;";1954;6.35994;2.0476;2;4;60;10;Ancient, Civilization, Nautical, Wargame;rome amp carthage wargame set mediterranean sea empire base city rome carthage constantinople alexandria occupy capital destroy opponent piece land sea different army consist footman cavalry elephant galley different combat card hand card come standard card deck different unit different power elephant example double high card cavalry double low certain combination card allow special action see opponent lay card

Players explore randomly shuffled decks of cards looking for potential colonies, good trading deals, opportunities to help planets, and either avoid or combat pirates.  Players can upgrade their ships' systems, including weapons to combat the pirates, thrusters to be able to explore further each turn, scanners to see (and avoid) cards that are coming up, and several others.  Victory points are earned by establishing colonies, building upgraded ship's systems, having the most friendship points, and having the most hero points.

2342;Mystery Mansion;"Mystery Mansion is a unique search game that challenges you to build a Victorian Mansion, room by room, as you search these rooms for hidden treasure.  Build the mansion by adding new rooms onto existing rooms with the roll of a special die.  Every room contains many objects which are all possible hiding places for clues to the whereabouts of the Real Treasure.  Search cards allow you to look behind, under and inside these objects for clues.  Try to add rooms that you suspect contain objects that match Search cards in your hand.  If you have a Search card that matches an object in the same room as your pawn, play it and draw a Clue card.  The clue might be a Treasure Chest, a Key to a chest, a Secret Passage or just Cobwebs and Dust.  If you own a key that matches a chest, haul the chest out of the mansion to unlock it.  Once it's outside, the big moment comes as you open the lid.

2343;Electronic Talking Mystery Mansion;"While this may have intended to be just an electronic update of the earlier Milton Bradley game, Electronic Talking Mystery Mansion ends up being a very different game.  Instead of a modular board, the board is fixed but the content of the rooms is variable.  Gone is the need to collect the right Search cards.  Instead players can search any item they like.  The electronic organizer tells the players what clues they find.  Some information is given to everyone, other information is just given to the active player.  Players deduce the location of the money based on the clues they find, and have to collect the correct clue cards (one item, one person) out of the 12 possible in order to obtain the money and win the game.  &#10;   The changes from the earlier board game: no search cards, no chests to drag out of the house, fewer hiding spots, and fewer clue cards, makes this version play much quicker and feel quite a bit lighter.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.43554;1.4;2;4;45;8;Deduction, Electronic, Exploration, Murder / Mystery;intend electronic update early milton bradley electronic talk mystery mansion end different instead modular fix content room variable go need collect right search card instead search item like electronic organizer tell clue find information give information give active deduce location money base clue find collect correct clue card item person possible order obtain money change early search card chest drag house few hiding spot few clue card make quick feel bit light

2346;DVONN;"DVONN is played on an elongated hexagonal board, with 23 white, 23 black and 3 red DVONN-pieces. In the beginning the board is empty. The players place the pieces on empty spaces of the board, without restrictions. They place the DVONN-pieces first and their own pieces next. Then they start stacking pieces on top of each other. A single piece may be moved 1 space in any direction, a stack of two pieces may be moved two spaces, etc. A stack must always be moved as a whole and a move must always end on top of another piece or stack. If pieces or stacks lose contact with the DVONN-pieces, they must be removed from the board. The game ends when no more moves can be made. The players put the stacks they control on top of each other and the one with the highest stack is the winner.&#10;&#10;This game is part of project GIPF.&#10;&#10;";2001;7.44144;2.6532;2;2;30;9;Abstract Strategy;dvonn elongate hexagonal white black red dvonn piece beginning place piece space restriction place dvonn piece piece start piece single piece space direction piece space etc end piece piece contact dvonn piece remove end high winner project gipf

There are two entrances onto the game track, but only one route leading  to the finish area.

There are 4 different types of items in this version, which are the different kinds of street performers in the marketplaces of Muscat.  The tiles representing the performers are placed in these marketplaces in such a way as to establish local dominance hierarchies, which are resolved by kicking the loser out on the street and promoting the winners to higher-class sections of Muscat.  Eventually, once can reach the Sultan's palace, and when enough performers have everyone scores points according to how high their performers have advanced up the board.&#10;&#10;There is more to it than that, of course.  The performers kicked out on the street want to get their revenge, and they can be placed back on the board or used to take 3 special actions which add a great deal of complexity to the game.  Although there is some randomness (in which tiles you pick when), this is essentially an abstract of the &quot;brain-burner&quot; school, and should be enjoyed by those who like that kind of  game.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Message to the Czar&#10;&#10;&#10;";2001;6.54106;2.381;3;5;45;10;Abstract Strategy, Arabian;muscat quickly describe advanced rock paper scissor well sound different item different kind street performer marketplace muscat tile represent performer place marketplace way establish local dominance hierarchy resolve kick loser street promote winner high class section muscat eventually reach sultan palace performer accord high performer advance course performer kick street want revenge place special action add great deal complexity randomness tile pick essentially abstract brain burner school enjoy like kind implement message czar

2355;Last Frontier: The Artifact;"Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;THE ARTIFACT is a space opera using the Last Frontier: The Vesuvius Incident game system (published  by Fat Messiah Games). Three to eight players take over such roles as the Mad Scientist, the Space Pirate Captain, the Phone Company, or a mystery Alien. Because the format is four way blind, and the players are uncertain of each other's motives, the fog of war is a formidable obstacle in this new gaming genre.&#10;&#10;The action takes place on a space warehouse at the edge of an un-navigable region of the Galaxy known as the Coal Sack. The mad scientist in charge of the facility is trying to sell the Artifact, an alien navigational buoy, to  space pirates. The scientist wins if he completes the deal while keeping his illegal activities secret from the Phone Company, who has a couple of agents on board the station somewhere.&#10;&#10;Victory for the Phone Company depends upon who their secret employers are. His agents may be just innocent employees here to fix the phone lines, they may be working for a rival Museum, or they may work for the Government or private agencies.&#10;&#10;The Pirate Captain's motives are more transparent; he needs to get the Artifact by trade, artifice, or force. Even with his overwhelming firepower, this is not easy. One of his men may be a government informant. The Artifact may not be all it seems. Loss of contact with his men may mean they have turned against him, or alien bugs have laid eggs on their disemboweled remains. A clank outside may signal imminent explosive decompression, or just a sailmaker robot on the outside hull doing its job.&#10;&#10;Aliens may or may not be on board; their nature is unknown. The ship's computer may or may not be a sentient character working with its own victory conditions. One's partner may be a trusted companion or a shapeshifting fiend in disguise. The ship's security system, robots, and self-destruct countdown may be puppets for unknown agencies.&#10;&#10;The Artifact is a gripping drama, full of surprises and mayhem. No two games are alike, full of sabotage, sneak suits, bluster, kamikaze aliens, EMP and plasma guns, booby traps, hacking, and the prospect of the space station being blown up bit by bit by pirate cannon. The action never falters until the last lifeboat is away, the final alias revealed, and the last storeroom explored.&#10;&#10;";2001;7.11515;3.6;3;8;120;10;Adventure, Deduction, Expansion for Base-game, Negotiation, Science Fiction, Wargame;description publisher artifact space opera frontier vesuvius incident publish fat messiah role mad scientist space pirate captain phone company mystery alien format way blind uncertain motive fog war formidable obstacle new gaming genre action take place space warehouse edge un navigable region galaxy know coal sack mad scientist charge facility try sell artifact alien navigational buoy space pirate scientist complete deal keep illegal activity secret phone company couple agent station phone company depend secret employer agent innocent employee fix phone line work rival museum work government private agency pirate captain motive transparent need artifact trade artifice force overwhelming firepower easy man government informant artifact loss contact man mean alien bug lay egg disembowel remain clank outside signal imminent explosive decompression sailmaker robot outside hull job alien nature unknown ship computer sentient character work condition partner trust companion shapeshifting fiend disguise ship security robot self destruct countdown puppet unknown agency artifact gripping drama surprise mayhem alike sabotage sneak suit bluster kamikaze aliens emp plasma gun booby trap hack prospect space station blow bit bit pirate cannon action falter lifeboat away final alias reveal storeroom explore
2356;Scrabble Sentence Cube Game;"Players in turn roll the 21 word cubes, set the timer and form sentences with the words appearing on the tops of the cubes in a crossword puzzle-like fashion (one word may be part of two sentences - one running vertically and one running horizontally). Turns end when the egg timer runs out. Players score 50 points for each sentence of 7 words or more. All other sentences score the square of the number of words in the sentence (i.e. a 4-word sentence scores 4 X 4, or 16 points). A bonus of 50 points is awarded if all 21 cubes are used. Two points are deducted for each unused cube.&#10;&#10;The 1983 version of the game seems to differ in the number of cubes.  The rules on the inside of the box lid still have a 1971 copyright date, but among other differences, they state that the game contains 27 cubes.  Two of the new cubes are marked with stars on all six sides, making them wild.

2360;Sekt oder Selters;"Theme&#10;&quot;Lola's Bar&quot; is very popular and crowded. The way to the counter is long, and everyone else is trying to get there too in order to get the best drinks. Hurrying a little and elbowing your way through the bar is okay, but if you aren't careful and overshoot the mark you're back on the street again.&#10;&#10;Goal&#10;Collecting as many points as possible by winning the most valuable drink cards.&#10;&#10;Game play&#10;The board shows Lola's Bar with a couple of tables, a parcours consisting of several spaces, and the counter. At the counter, you can get sparkling wine (&quot;Sekt&quot;) or soda (&quot;Selters&quot;). To reach the counter, you roll the dice.&#10;On each turn, you roll up to three times and move one of your four pawns the corresponding number of spaces. Pawns have a value of 1-4. For the first roll, you use one die, for the second roll two dice, and for the third roll three dice, and you have to use the same pawn in each of your up to three rolls per turn. In between rolls, you can decide to stop and end your turn. If one of your pawns reaches one of the four counter spaces, you get the top sparkling wine card (sparkling wine cards are stacked face up). &#10;Sparkling wine cards mostly have positive values, some of them show a dot before one or several zeros (.0, .00, .000). The dot means that you use your pawn that reached the counter to determine its value, i.e. if your pawn with value 4 gets the .000 card, it is worth 400 points. The pawn is put on the card and stays there for the rest of the game.&#10;If you roll too high and your pawn passes the counter space, you get served soda, i.e. you draw the top of the face-down soda cards. Soda cards mostly have negative values (-10 to -1000), and there is also a card which bans you from the bar (i.e. your token is removed from the game).&#10;If you land on a special space, you have to use this particular pawn.&#10;There can only be one pawn per space. If you'd land on a space that is already occupied, the other player decides which closest free space (either backwards or forwards) you have to move your pawn to.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player has no pawns left. The player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;";1992;5.83846;1.0;2;4;30;8;Dice;lola bar popular crowd way long try order good drink hurry little elbow way bar okay aren t careful overshoot mark street collect possible valuable drink card show lola bar couple table parcour consist space sparkle wine sekt soda selter reach dice time pawn correspond number space pawn value use die second dice dice use pawn decide stop end pawn reach space sparkle wine card sparkle wine card face sparkle wine card positive value dot zero dot mean use pawn reach determine value e pawn value get card worth pawn card stay rest high pawn pass space serve soda e draw face soda card soda card negative value card ban bar e token remove land special space use particular pawn pawn space d land space occupy decide close free space backwards forwards pawn end pawn leave

A fifth species, the Metamorphs (a grey-colored suit), has the ability to take on the characteristics of the other races and tip the scales. The game is played in two phases. In the first, players bid for the right to name trump (determine which race, or suit, has &quot;the power&quot; for that round) and to decide whether scoring will be positive or negative (whether players will receive points for tricks taken or for taking the least number of tricks).

Now he returns for the last time to his Tower, wherin lies the magic that makes one Wizard supreme over all others.  For captured within is the magical Power of Transformation that allows a creature to enter the Tower as one self-- and emerge as another!

2364;Black Monday;"Black Monday gets its name from the stock market crash of Oct. 19, 1987, and it's a commercial edition of Sid Sackson's game &quot;Card Stock Market&quot; from the book Card Games Around the World, with this game being playable with two standard decks of playing cards.&#10;&#10;The game includes 104 cards, with corporation cards in four colors. Each card shows a monetary value, along with a number of shares. Reveal cards from the deck until you get one card of each color, and use these cards to set the starting price of the shares for each of the four corporations. Deal each player a hand of eight cards, and give each player $20,000 as starting capital.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you can deal in shares (both buying and selling) and change the value of stocks, but you must do all of your dealing either prior to or subsequent to changing stock values. When you deal, you can sell any number of shares you own, earning money from the bank equal to the number of shares sold by the current value of those shares; when you buy, you can lay down at most two cards from your hand, paying money to the bank equal to the number of shares bought by the current value of those shares.&#10;&#10;When you change value, you take one or two cards from your hand and cover a corporation's current value with this new value; corporations have different limits on how much they can be raised or lowered per card play, with some being more stable than others. If you play the highest-valued cards, you can either pump up the value tremendously &mdash; or tank the stock, bringing its value to $0, with all players discarding all shares they own of this stock. (A player can jumpstart the value of this company by playing a new stock value on it, even with the second card played on the same turn.)&#10;&#10;Alternatively, you can skip the dealing and changing actions to discard 1-4 cards from hand. In either case, to end your turn, replenish your hand to eight cards.&#10;&#10;When the deck is exhausted, take all of the discards and all of the stock value cards other than the top one of each corporation and shuffle them together with a &quot;Market Closed&quot; card to form a new deck. Continue play until the &quot;Market Closed&quot; card is drawn, at which point the game ends immediately, and all shares held by players are cashed out at the current stock value. Whoever has the most money wins.&#10;&#10;";1988;5.72214;2.0625;2;6;45;10;Card Game, Economic;black monday get stock market crash oct commercial sid sackson card stock market book card world playable standard deck card include card corporation card color card show monetary value number share reveal card deck card color use card set starting price share corporation deal hand card start capital deal share buy sell change value stock deal prior subsequent change stock value deal sell number share earn money bank equal number share sell current value share buy lay card hand pay money bank equal number share buy current value share change value card hand cover corporation current value new value corporation different limit raise lower card stable high value card pump value tremendously mdash tank stock bring value discard share stock jumpstart value company new stock value second card alternatively skip dealing change action discard card hand case end replenish hand card deck exhausted discard stock value card corporation shuffle market close card form new deck continue market close card draw end immediately share hold cash current stock value money

Terrain cards take the place of a map, so each expedition encounters variable terrain on their journey north. Once the ice is reached, they proceed on foot or by sled as far as they dare, limited by bad food, weather, crevasses, scurvy, deep snow, and mutiny. Due to the &quot;you against the elements&quot; nature of the expeditions, player interaction is minimized, making for an excellent solitaire game. Three solitaire scenarios are included, as well as the 2 to 5 player competition game that includes disaster card play and newspaper attacks on your opponents.

2396;Ur: 1830 BC;"This game isn't a true 18xx game, in the sense that it's officially sanctioned by Francis Tresham.  However, it shares a good number of characteristics with the 18xx series of games, while still being different enough to be a different game.  The game is about diverting water from rivers into irrigation channels and supplying the life-giving water to sections of land.  In 18xx, there are private companies; in Ur, there are independent nations.  In 18xx, there are companies with shareholders and a majority-controlling president; in Ur, there are countries with landowners and a majority-controlling King.  Once a Kingdom has enough land purchased in it, it begins to build water infrastructure in the form of reservoirs and pumps.  These structures draw the water away from the rivers into irrigation channels which are drawn straight on the board.  Like 18xx, the technology increases as the game progresses, making channel diggers obsolete and bringing out more efficient waterworks.  When a section of land is irrigated, the owner earns a small degree income and the kingdom it's located in earns a much larger income, which can then be given to the landowners or kept in the Kingdom's coffers for future upgrades.  The game is finally over when all the incoming water is used, forcing the southern tribes to invade, or a kingdom cannot fulfill it's obligation to buy more ditch-diggers and falls into revolution.  The player with the largest personal holdings (land and money) is the victor.&#10;&#10;";2001;6.84428;3.8621;3;6;180;14;Ancient, Civilization;isn t true xx sense officially sanction francis tresham share good number characteristic xx series different different divert water river irrigation channel supply life give water section land xx private company ur independent nation xx company shareholder majority president ur country landowner majority king kingdom land purchase begin build water infrastructure form reservoir pump structure draw water away river irrigation channel draw straight like xx technology increase progress make channel digger obsolete bring efficient waterworks section land irrigate owner earn small degree income kingdom locate earn large income give landowner keep kingdom coffer future upgrade finally incoming water force southern tribe invade kingdom fulfill obligation buy ditch digger fall revolution large personal holding land money victor
2398;Cribbage;"Cribbage is a card game invented in the early 17th century, based on the earlier game Noddy. It is played with a deck of standard playing cards and a signature piece of equipment called the cribbage board.  Cribbage is traditionally played as a 2 player game.&#10;&#10;In the version usually played today, each player is dealt a hand of 6 cards, from which they discard 2 into a special pile called the Crib.  One card is then cut from the draw pile and turned face up - it is considered part of each player's hand and of the Crib.  The players then play cards in turn, scoring points for hitting certain totals, or for making sets or sequences.  Score is kept by moving pegs along tracks on the cribbage board.  This is repeated until both players have exhausted their hand of cards.&#10;&#10;Next, each player picks up their hand and determines all possible scoring combinations, pegging points again on the cribbage board.  The dealer then picks up the Crib and scores it for all possible points.  Then the cards are shuffled and the deal alternates.  The winner is the first to reach 121 points.&#10;&#10;The origin date listed for this game is approximate.&#10;&#10;";1630;7.10318;1.8983;2;6;30;10;Card Game, Number;cribbage card invent early th century base early noddy deck standard playing card signature piece equipment call cribbage cribbage traditionally usually today deal hand card discard special pile call crib card cut draw pile face consider hand crib card hit certain total make set sequence keep peg track cribbage repeat exhaust hand card pick hand determine possible combination pegging cribbage dealer pick crib possible card shuffle deal alternate winner reach origin date list approximate

2406;Whosit?;"Character Guessing Game&#10;&#10;Players randomly choose one of 20 character cards which depict one of the cast of characters.  Each character has a variety of characteristics.  Each player also gets some question cards.  Each player then takes turns asking their question to the other players.  If you get a Yes, you may draw another question card and ask another question.  If you get a No, you may ask no more questions, but may try to guess the identity of all the players.  A nice mechanism for showing if the player is right is part of the game.  When a player makes his guesses a box is handed around and each player puts a chip in the Yes side if his identity was correctly guessed or a chip in the No side if it was not.  The guessing player looks at the results and the game ends if all the chips are in the Yes side.  Else the game continues.&#10;There are also some oddball characters that will either: always lie, always answer no, or answer yes or no to any question.&#10;&#10;";1976;5.39055;1.3333;2;6;45;0;Deduction;character guessing randomly choose character card depict cast character character variety characteristic get question card take ask question yes draw question card ask question ask question try guess identity nice mechanism show right make guess box hand put chip yes identity correctly guess chip guess look result end chip yes continue oddball character lie answer answer yes question

2410;Kanaloa;"Two to four players go from island to island to pick up different fruit to give to the gods. Between the islands are fish to move in one direction (to the fish's mouth). One side of a fish shows the player's color (only this player may move) the other no color (any player may move). After every move the fish is turned to the other color.&#10;&#10;The gods help the player who gives the most fruit; to move (turn direction or color of a fish), to steal (of course from another player), to determine a volcanic eruption (the players near the volcanic eruption lose a turn) or to pick up better fruit.&#10;&#10;The rules are developed from the theme (character of Hawaiian gods, building small stone temples), but it's not historical. The theme and design is similar to Kahuna / Arabana-Ikibiti, but it is more for gamers than for families, and does not require the building of connections.&#10;&#10;Confusingly, Tilsit re-named another game by G&#195;&#188;nter Cornett with a similar island-theme Kanaloa in 2003, but it is different, and more closely related to Kahuna.&#10;&#10;3rd Place 2001 Hippodice Spieleautorenwettbewerb.&#10;&#10;";2001;6.37403;2.6;2;4;90;8;Nautical;island island pick different fruit god island fish direction fish mouth fish show color color fish color god help give fruit direction color fish steal course determine volcanic eruption near volcanic eruption pick well fruit develop character hawaiian god build small stone temple historical similar kahuna arabana ikibiti gamer family require building connection confusingly tilsit name g nter cornett similar island kanaloa different closely related kahuna rd place hippodice spieleautorenwettbewerb

2426;Hit the Beach;"One of the American Heritage Command Decision Strategy Games.&#10;&#10;A World War II Pacific Campaign game, the players are in a race with each other to reach the &quot;final objective&quot; -- the main Japanese HQ. The Japanese defense forces (14 pieces) are obstacles for all players; when defeated, they are redeployed by that player and can thus be used to slow down opponents.&#10;&#10;Each player has 6 pieces (2 Marines, 2 infantry, 1 naval landing support ship and 1 strategic air support aircraft). On a player's turn, they roll the die and can move one of their soldiers. The support pieces (ship/aircraft) move only on a 6 and are immediately deployed where necessary to support a beach landing. Moving a soldier on top of an opponent's by exact count &quot;relieves&quot; it and sends it back to its start space. Each player must clear the two beaches that match their color. To do this, both support pieces must first be brought to bear, and then a Marine must reach the defender by exact count. Once cleared, beaches remain clear and can be used by all players.&#10;&#10;The mechanics are a variant of the old public domain game of Malefiz or Barricade.&#10;&#10;";1965;5.33046;1.125;2;4;60;10;Wargame, World War II;american heritage command decision strategy world war ii pacific campaign race reach final main japanese hq japanese defense force piece obstacle defeat redeploy slow opponent piece marines infantry naval landing support ship strategic air support aircraft die soldier support piece ship aircraft immediately deploy necessary support beach landing soldier opponent exact count relieve send start space clear beach match color support piece bring bear marine reach defender exact count clear beach remain clear old public domain malefiz barricade
2428;Battle-Cry;"One of the American Heritage Command Decision Strategy Games.&#10;&#10;This one is the American Civil War game.  Each side has 22 pieces (10 infantry, 10 cavalry and 2 artillery), and the starting positions are fixed.  The grid is square, with no diagonal movement allowed.  On your turn, you roll two dice for movement, resulting in between 2 and 12 movement points to allocate.  Infantry moves 1 per pip, cavalry and artillery 2 per pip (a one-square move still consumes 1 pip).  Mountains force pieces to pause (they must stop until the next turn).  Railroads link stations and can be used to accelerate movement (one station per pip).&#10;&#10;Combat is handled by lining pieces up (horizontally or vertically) to face (or flank) an enemy column.  You must have battle strength superiority to resolve the battle, and this is done after movement is concluded.  Infantry and artillery have combat strength 2, cavalry has combat strength 1.  The rear piece then jumps to the other end of the combined columns, and the entire enemy army is removed.  To be used, cavalry must have a piece at the front; artillery, if at the rear of your column, eliminates the enemy army without jumping.  Artillery cannot attack by itself.  Double jumps can happen, if the jumping infantry piece ends up facing a lone cavalry.  An open square must exist to jump to, so some map deployments are &quot;safe&quot; --but not against artillery.  However, pieces trapped so they cannot move are also removed as if they had lost a battle, so this strategy can backfire.&#10;&#10;You win by completely eliminating the enemy army --but a player may concede earlier when a loss becomes unavoidable.  The four player game splits command of each army in two, and is played in partnerships.&#10;&#10;A really good game, combining a historical theme with rather abstract mechanics.&#10;&#10;";1961;5.58478;1.625;2;4;60;10;American Civil War, Post-Napoleonic, Wargame;american heritage command decision strategy american civil war piece infantry cavalry artillery starting position fix grid square diagonal allow dice result allocate infantry pip cavalry artillery pip square consume pip mountain force piece pause stop railroad link station accelerate station pip combat handle line piece horizontally vertically face flank enemy column battle strength superiority resolve battle conclude infantry artillery combat strength cavalry combat strength rear piece jump end combine column entire enemy army remove cavalry piece artillery rear column eliminate enemy army jump artillery attack double jump happen jump infantry piece end face lone cavalry open square exist jump map deployment safe artillery piece trap remove battle strategy backfire completely eliminate enemy army concede early loss unavoidable split command army partnership good combine historical abstract

2438;LNL: Laplace, Newton & Lagrange;"BoneGames produces a number of do-it-yourself free games.  You download a PDF containing rules and components, and print out what is required for play.&#10;&#10;LNL - Laplace, Newton &amp; Lagrange (briefly known as DeltaVee in its early stages) is a game of ship to ship combat in outer space.  Using a unique movement system that forces players to deal with momentum, and a fast and simple combat system, LNL is a great addition to the space game genre.&#10;&#10;The game involves combat between the Moon and Earth, with individual ships represented by each counter.  Each side has from 3-8 ships.  Each ship has a log covering armament, fuel, engines and defence.  These logs are reminiscent or the Task Force Game 'Starfire', but have fewer options, but a more sophisticated layout.&#10;&#10;The heart of the game is a vector-momentum system (like the one in Yaquinto's Shooting Stars or SPI's Vector Three).  Ships have a facing, use fuel to thrust towards the current facing, but speeds carry over from turn to turn.  Therefore ships can only decelerate only by turning and thrusting in the opposite direction of travel.  Speed is marked by placing numbered counters in the relevant direction.&#10;&#10;Combat involves the use of missiles, guns (i.e. projectile weapons) and lasers.  Missiles are launched and move much like ships.  They are more manoeuvrable, but have a limited amount of fuel, used for acceleration and turning.  As a defence ships may have point defence weapons.  Guns and lasers are ranged weapons, with different arcs of fire, but essentially the same resolution.  Damage is assessed by throwing the requisite number of dice - any dice will do, or  even coins - the game using an EOR (even/odds randomiser) - with odd rolls yielding a hit.  Damage is then marked off the ship, with the affected area depending on the side through which fire was taken.&#10;&#10;Each side (Moon and Earth) has a choice of 8 types of ships and 5 basic scenarios are available, each with a great deal of flexibility.  Tactics can be involved and subtle.  The  interplay of weapon types makes this an exciting game.  It is easy to learn and has great variety.&#10;&#10;";1994;5.67;2.0;2;2;90;12;Print & Play, Science Fiction, Wargame;bonegame produce number free download pdf contain component print require lnl laplace newton amp lagrange briefly know deltavee early stage ship ship combat outer space unique force deal momentum fast simple combat lnl great addition space genre involve combat moon earth individual ship represent ship ship log cover armament fuel engine defence log reminiscent task force starfire few option sophisticated layout heart vector momentum like yaquinto shoot star spi vector ship face use fuel thrust current facing speed carry ship decelerate thrust opposite direction travel speed mark place numbered relevant direction combat involve use missile gun e projectile weapon laser missile launch like ship manoeuvrable limited fuel acceleration defence ship defence weapon gun laser range weapon different arc fire essentially resolution damage assess throw requisite number dice dice coin eor odd randomiser odd yield hit damage mark ship affected area depend fire take moon earth ship basic available great deal flexibility tactic involve subtle interplay weapon make exciting easy learn great variety

If they manage to manoeuvre at torpedo run distance from an enemy carrier (6 hexes), drop their torpedoes.  These move inexorably one space per turn so the only defence is manoeuvring.  If the aircraft get within dogfight distance of each other (4 hexes), they may engage in a dogfight, which uses cards (a better pilot rating gives you extra cards) --it also forces the torpedoes to be dropped, so sacrifice dogfights are a viable tactic.  If you run out of torpedoes, you may kamikaze your aircraft.&#10;&#10;An amusing tactical simulation, very simple and fast-playing, with nice bits to boot.&#10;&#10;Remade in to Mission Command Sea.&#10;&#10;";1977;6.08445;1.4286;2;4;45;8;Miniatures, Nautical, Wargame, World War II;pit aircraft carrier task force carrier load torpedo aircraft pilot represent rating embark aircraft launch carrier special die give carrier chance forward degree aircraft normal d manage manoeuvre torpedo run distance enemy carrier hex drop torpedo inexorably space defence manoeuvre aircraft dogfight distance hex engage dogfight use card well pilot rating give extra card force torpedo drop sacrifice dogfight viable tactic run torpedo kamikaze aircraft amusing tactical simulation simple fast playing nice bit boot remade mission command sea
2446;Chopper Strike;"In this game, each player manoeuvres a fleet of helicopters and a fleet of jeeps (equipped with AA guns), trying to gain air or ground superiority.  That is to say, you win by wiping out all of your opponent's choppers or all of his jeeps.&#10;   A d3 indicates how many pieces you will move, and a d6 how far each one will move.  Choppers move on the elevated &quot;air&quot; board, whilst jeeps stick to the ground.  Terrain obstacles complicate matters for the jeeps at the players' &quot;border&quot;.  Choppers take choppers out by jumping over them (&agrave; la checkers); they can also take jeeps out by bombing them (stopping right above them).  Jeeps take jeeps out by landing on them; they can also take choppers out using their AA guns (stopping right below them).&#10;&#10;";1976;5.34178;1.4783;2;2;45;8;Aviation / Flight, Miniatures, Modern Warfare, Wargame;manoeuvre fleet helicopter fleet jeep equip aa gun try gain air ground superiority wipe opponent chopper jeep d indicate piece d far chopper elevated air whilst jeep stick ground terrain obstacle complicate matter jeep border chopper chopper jump agrave la checker jeep bomb stop right jeep jeep land chopper aa gun stop right
2448;Kalah;"The most common rule set in games sold commercially as Mancala is for this game of Kalah. Mancala is actually a whole family of games. Kalah was invented in 1940 by an American, William Champion Jr..  He started selling the game in 1944, patented the rules in the 1950's, and founded the Kalah Game Co. in 1958.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a board of two rows, each consisting of six round pits. The rows have a large store at either end called the Kalah. A player owns the six pits closest to them and the Kalah on their right side.&#10;&#10;The game is started with four (4) seeds in each pit. A player takes all the seeds from one of their pits, and then they are distributed one by one, counterclockwise, in the pits and the player's own Kalah, but not into the opponent's store (Kalah). If the last seed is dropped into an opponent's pit or a non-empty pit of the player, the move ends without anything being captured. If the last seed falls into the player's Kalah, they must move again. If the last seed is put into an empty pit owned by the player, they capture all contents of the opposite pit together with the capturing piece and puts them in their Kalah. If the opposite pit is empty, nothing is captured. A capture ends the move.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player no longer has any seeds in any of their holes. The remaining pieces are captured by their adversary. The player who has captured the most pieces is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;Variants:&#10;&#10;Beginners may start with 3 seeds in each pit, but the game can also be played with 5 or 6 seeds in each pit. William Champion Jr. recommended the expert game with 6 in each pit.&#10;&#10;In the Philippines Version (called Sungka locally) the game is often played with small shells, there are 7 pits on each side as well as the Home and the game is started with 7 shells in each pit.&#10;&#10;";700;5.99664;1.5979;2;2;10;5;Abstract Strategy;common set sell commercially mancala kalah mancala actually family games kalah invent american william champion jr start sell patent found kalah co row consist pit row large store end call kalah own pit close kalah right start seed pit take seed pit distribute counterclockwise pit kalah opponent store kalah seed drop opponent pit non pit end capture seed fall kalah seed pit own capture content opposite pit capture piece put kalah opposite pit capture capture end end long seed hole remain piece capture adversary capture piece declare winner beginner start seed pit seed pit william champion jr recommend expert pit philippine call sungka locally small shell pit home start shell pit
2450;Deuce;"These 52 cards, 11 cards (0 through 10) in each of 4 colour suits plus 6 Rainbow cards and 2 X cards.  You try to go out (empty your hand) during each hand; score is kept and the first player to reach 100 wins.&#10;   Each player is dealt 6 cards.  You begin by placing two cards of your choice in front of you, face up, to create two discard piles.  The two cards played must match either by colour or by number.  In turn, you play one card from your hand onto any of the discard piles.  To play onto a pile, the card played must match the other pile's card in number or colour.  If you can't or don't wish to play a card, you must draw cards until you can play one.  Should the draw be exhausted, a new deck is made from the discard piles, keeping only the topmost cards.&#10;   To go out, your discard piles must at least tie all the others in number value.  Score is 10 points for the player who went out, plus the combined values of the cards left in the other players' hands.  The discards aren't scored.&#10;   Rainbow cards are wild, being of all four colours at once --they match any card.  The card value is zero, which may be handy to reduce an opponent's discard piles value.  X cards (also worth zero), on the other hand, can only be matched by Rainbow or X cards.&#10;&#10;";1985;5.46585;1.0;2;6;20;8;Card Game, Math;card card colour suit plus rainbow card x card try hand hand keep reach deal card begin place card face create discard pile card match colour number card hand discard pile pile card match pile card number colour t don t wish card draw card draw exhaust new deck discard pile keep topmost card discard pile tie number value go plus combine value card leave hand discard aren t rainbow card wild colour match card card value zero handy reduce opponent discard pile value x card worth zero hand match rainbow x card
2452;Jenga;"Jenga is tower building game played with 54 wooden blocks; each block is 3 times as long as it is wide, and slightly smaller in height than in width. The blocks are stacked in a tower formation; each story is three blocks placed adjacent to each other along their long side, and each story is placed perpendicular to the previous (so, for example, if the blocks in the first story are pointing north-south, the second story blocks will point east-west). There are therefore 18 stories to the Jenga tower. Since stacking the blocks neatly can be tedious, a plastic loading tray is included.&#10;&#10;Once the tower is built, the person who built the tower moves first. Moving in Jenga consists of taking one and only one block from any story except the completed top story of the tower at the time of the turn, and placing it on the topmost story in order to complete it. Only one hand at a time may be used to remove a block; both hands can be used, but only one hand may be on the tower at a time. Blocks may be bumped to find a loose block that will not disturb the rest of the tower. Any block that is moved out of place may be left out of place if it is determined that it will knock the tower over if it is removed. The turn ends when the next person to move touches the tower, although he or she can wait 10 seconds before moving for the previous turn to end if they believe the tower will fall in that time.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the tower falls in any significant way -- in other words, any piece falls from the tower, other than the piece being knocked out to move to the top. The loser is the person who made the tower fall (i.e. whose turn it was when the tower fell); the winner is the person who moved before the loser.&#10;&#10;The same game concept was published in 1984 by Fagus under the name &quot;Hoppla - eins zuviel!&quot; According to the designer, the game was developed from Takoradi blocks/bricks. &quot;Jenga&quot; is Swahili for &quot;build&quot;.&#10;&#10;";1983;5.65434;1.104;1;8;20;6;Action / Dexterity, Party Game;jenga tower building wooden block block time long wide slightly small height width block tower formation story block place adjacent long story place perpendicular previous example block story north south second story block east west story jenga tower block neatly tedious plastic loading tray include tower build person build tower jenga consist take block story complete story tower time place topmost story order complete hand time remove block hand hand tower time block bump find loose block disturb rest tower block place leave place determined knock tower remove end person touch tower wait second previous end believe tower fall time end tower fall significant way word piece fall tower piece knock loser person tower fall e tower fall winner person loser concept publish fagus hoppla ein zuviel accord designer develop takoradi blocks bricks jenga swahili build

2463;Scavenger Hunt;"The object of this game is to find and bring back Home four randomly designated objects (out of a possible selection of 16), in sequence, as in a Scavenger Hunt.&#10;&#10;The objects are deployed on the board using a semi-random method.  Then play begins.  You use dice to move your pawn, but cards are required to move through house rooms --otherwise you're confined to the sidewalks (without the right cards, you may also end up &quot;trapped in a garage&quot;, the only room that does not have a direct exit to the sidewalk).  Pairs of cards can also be traded in for extra turns.

2464;Swords & Sorcery: Quest and Conquest in the Age of Magic;"[SPI Advertisement c1978]&#10;&#10;SWORDS AND SORCERY&#10;Quest and Conquest in the Age of Magic&#10;&#10;- Separate Army and Quest Game, plus Role-Playing Version&#10;- Full Background &ldquo;History&rdquo; and Characters&#10;- Professionally Illustrated by Tim Kirk&#10;&#10;The Valley of the Great Sword is a much warred over area on a small planet in a trinary system many lightyears and eons removed from Terra.  Superficially, there is no great difference between this highly prized region and any other coveted area that nations have fought over since time immemorial.  But the Valley, and indeed the whole planet, guards a secret so valuable that few off-planet visitors that have visited that remote corner of the galaxy have all been mercilessly killed.  For the Valley is an area of great magicks, where technology has all but disappeared.&#10;&#10;Long ago in the Age of the Great Upheaval (which not even the oldest of the denizens of the Valley can recall), the Council of Wizards abolished all weapons that were more advance than those used in Earth's Middle Ages.  This was because (most scholars have it) mages could be killed by long range weapons before they could employ their defensive spells, and greatly feared the advent of mass-produced technology.  But the population of that world trusted mages no more than you and I, and there followed a series of great wars which succeeded in devastating all areas of the planet with the exception of the Valley (called Ararlve by the ancients).&#10;&#10;A great meeting was held at the Altar of the Elder Gods, and its purpose was to determine whether the Human race should be allowed to survive.  The Dragons, The Swamp-Creatures and the Spiders all vociferously argued for the extermination of all mortals, as they greatly feared the return of wizards who would be able to challenge their power.  But the Elves and Dwarrows who are kin to Man showed mercy, and the meeting finally resolved that mortals would forever be excluded from the Valley.  Grisha, then the greatest among Dragons, prophesied that the Elves and Dwarrows would meet their doom at the hands of Men.  This so enraged Gwaimallion Elflord that he joined Grisha in mortal combat and slew him on the spot.  As Grisha died he pronounced his deathcurse upon Elves and Dwarrows, &ldquo;My prophecy shall come true within three Ages!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;It was a shaken group of creatures who adjourned the great meeting.  But none would for get Grisha's curse, and many sought to destroy Men in any way possible.  Even some of the Elves and Dwarrows, fearful of the prophecy, sought to kill Men wherever they might be found.  But the human race is a hardy one, and is not so easy to eliminate.  For an entire Age, Men throughout the planet barely survived, running from their many oppressors.  But when the Second Age dawned, the other races began to accept Men, and rudimentary civilizations developed.&#10;&#10;Since the beginning of recorded time, all races have shown equal adeptness at handling manna, the energy from which all magic emanates.  But only the race of Man can create power items, which are great storehouses of manna.  And with these power items the race of Man evolves superhumans adept at handling the items.  It is this chain of events that all other races fear, for a united human race can defeat all other inhabitants of the world combined once they reach this stage.&#10;&#10;And so, at the beginning of the Third Age A.U. (After the Upheaval), the race of Man began to dominate once again.  The reappearance of Wizards and the conquest of half the world occurred in less than one century.  The Elder Races recognized this threat for what it was, but they were unable to co-operate amongst each other due to age-old differences.  The situation became dire when the various nations coalesced into the Second Empire.  Soon all lands but the Valley were Human-controlled.&#10;&#10;The Valley, root of the most powerful magic, from which the power of Man stemmed, now ironically provided refuge from Man.  The Valley could not be tamed by Man, and in its own defense it produced great amounts of manna.  At this point, forces of the Empire invaded the fabled city of Urf Durfal on the outskirts of the Valley and sought to conquer it in one swift stroke.  Leading the charge into the Valley was Emperor Coron the Unconquerable, and his defeat at the hands of Zurik Bladebreaker Dwarfking signaled the rebirth of the ancient races.  But that was not all, that was coming back to the Valley.  Two great and evil wizards each sought to be the Dark Lord, while a renegade noble sought to establish a separate nation in the heart of the Valley.  Contact was made with the inhabitants of the daemonic plane, and all sorts of demons, minor and major, roamed the Valley.  To cap it all off, discovery of several of the ancient and most powerful power items occurred.  The Empire had a most formidable challenge.&#10;&#10;Swords and Sorcery is a game portraying the climactic period of the War against the Elder Races.  The Army Game, which deals with the &ldquo;historical&rdquo; battles of the war, uses a fairly simple combat system so that the Players may better explore the detailed spell lists, the Diplomacy rules and the various game mechanics that deal with all the elements necessary to fantasy.  Twelve Scenarios, beginning with the aforementioned Coron's campaign in the Valley and concluding with the final attempt to capture the Valley by the Empire, deal with all the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; fantasy situations.  Each Player is given control of an army and one or more Characters.  While the individual army units are important, it is the Characters who dominate the Army Game, by their leadership and (for those with magical abilities) their spell-casing abilities.&#10;&#10;Also included in the Swords and Sorcery package is a Quest Game, which involves the Players using the various Characters during periods where there is a lull in the War.  A Player will be given a specified number of Characters and objective, and seeks to perform better against the nasties or villain than his opponent(s).  Of course, your brave fighter may be vanquished by a fearsome troll before he is able to battle the guardian of the sword he seeks, or your Magic User may be defeated by a Spectre.  There are great perils in the Valley.  It will not do for a Dwarf to go merrily traipsing through the provinces of the Elves, else he be captured and need to be rescued by his kindred.  But a band of battle-hardened adventurers can defeat nearly any threat that besets them &ndash; the challenge is to avoid the death of one or more of the brave questers.  All of these possibilities are handled by such rules as the expansion of the spell list, a detailed personal combat routine, and even a Section on how to create your own character, if those provided with the game do not satisfy.&#10;&#10;Swords and Sorcery includes a 22&rdquo; by 35&rdquo; game-map which portrays the Valley of the Great Sword, 400 four-color counters which represent many different races &ndash; Human, Elf, Dwarf, Goblin, Hobgoblin, Spider, Dragon, Swamp-Creature, Cronk, Demon and Monster &ndash; that live in or intrude upon the Valley, 56 illustrated cards, consisting of 40 Character illustrations, 10 Magic (or Power) Item illustrations, and 6 Monster illustrations, and a lengthy rules booklet including an extensive fantasy background.&#10;&#10;Swords and Sorcery represents the culmination of over a year's work, and includes a wide range of fantasy elements.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;This fantasy wargame is really two games in one. The Army game uses SPI zones-of-control and a combat results table. Forces include elves, dwarves, orcs, spiders, swamp creatures and a host of others set in a fictional valley on a fictional world. Some of the more exotic inclusions are memorable for their pun value:  Unamit Ahezredit, Logarithm Son of Algorithm; places such as the Evelyn Woods and the Stream of Consciousness, as well as the notorious Hills of Avalon; and peoples such as the Corflu (Correction Fluid) Cultists, the (communist) Orcish Revolutionary Council, and the dreaded Killer Penguins.  X the Unknown could potentially conjure the SS Wiking Division. The Quest game is concerned exclusively with characters and is akin to a role-playing game.The game appeared with two covers: a blue box with a Tim Kirk illustration and a red box with a John Butterfield illustration. The games are otherwise identical.&#10;&#10;";1978;6.98526;3.2258;2;7;180;12;Adventure, Fantasy, Wargame;spi advertisement c sword sorcery quest conquest age magic separate army quest plus role background ldquo history rdquo character professionally illustrate tim kirk valley great sword war area small planet trinary lightyear eon remove terra superficially great difference highly prize region coveted area nation fight time immemorial valley planet guard secret valuable planet visitor visit remote corner galaxy mercilessly kill valley area great magick technology disappear long ago age great upheaval old denizen valley recall council wizard abolish weapon advance earth middle age scholar mage kill long range weapon employ defensive spell greatly fear advent mass produce technology population world trust mage follow series great war succeed devastate area planet exception valley call ararlve ancient great meeting hold altar eld god purpose determine human race allow survive dragon swamp creature spider vociferously argue extermination mortal greatly fear return wizard able challenge power elf dwarrow kin man show mercy meeting finally resolve mortal forever exclude valley grisha great dragon prophesy elf dwarrow meet doom hand man enraged gwaimallion elflord join grisha mortal combat slay spot grisha die pronounce deathcurse elf dwarrow ldquo prophecy shall come true age rdquo shaken group creature adjourn great meeting grisha curse seek destroy man way possible elf dwarrow fearful prophecy seek kill man find human race hardy easy eliminate entire age man planet barely survive run oppressor second age dawn race begin accept man rudimentary civilization develop beginning record time race show equal adeptness handle manna energy magic emanate race man create power item great storehouse manna power item race man evolve superhuman adept handle item chain event race fear united human race defeat inhabitant world combine reach stage beginning age u upheaval race man begin dominate reappearance wizard conquest half world occur century eld race recognize threat unable co operate age old difference situation dire nation coalesce second empire soon land valley human valley root powerful magic power man stem ironically provide refuge man valley tame man defense produce great amount manna force empire invade fabled city urf durfal outskirt valley seek conquer swift stroke lead charge valley emperor coron unconquerable defeat hand zurik bladebreaker dwarfking signal rebirth ancient race come valley great evil wizard seek dark lord renegade noble seek establish separate nation heart valley contact inhabitant daemonic plane sort demon minor major roam valley cap discovery ancient powerful power item occur empire formidable challenge sword sorcery portray climactic period war elder race army deal ldquo historical rdquo battle war use fairly simple combat well explore detailed spell list diplomacy deal element necessary fantasy begin aforementioned coron campaign valley conclude final attempt capture valley empire deal ldquo standard rdquo fantasy situation give army character individual army unit important character dominate army leadership magical spell casing include sword sorcery package quest involve character period lull war give specified number character seek perform well nastie villain opponent course brave fighter vanquish fearsome troll able battle guardian sword seek magic user defeat spectre great peril valley dwarf merrily traipse province elf capture need rescue kindre band battle harden adventurer defeat nearly threat beset ndash challenge avoid death brave quester possibility handle spell list detailed personal combat routine section create character provide satisfy sword sorcery include rdquo rdquo map portray valley great sword color represent different race ndash human elf dwarf goblin hobgoblin spider dragon swamp creature cronk demon monster ndash live intrude valley illustrate card consist character illustration magic power item illustration monster illustration lengthy booklet include extensive fantasy background sword sorcery represent culmination year work include wide range fantasy element fantasy wargame army use spi zone combat result table force include elf dwarf orc spider swamp creature host set fictional valley fictional world exotic inclusion memorable pun value unamit ahezredit logarithm son algorithm place evelyn wood stream consciousness notorious hill avalon people corflu correction fluid cultist communist orcish revolutionary council dreaded killer penguin x unknown potentially conjure ss wiking division quest concern exclusively character akin role playing appear cover blue box tim kirk illustration red box john butterfield illustration identical

Play can be prolonged either by going for a larger number of cards or by going through the entire deck of 34 frame patterns.&#10;   Each card shows four white dots and ignores the opponent's piece deployment, so you're really playing two different games at once and just getting in each other's way.

2467;Zillionaire;"This game is a close relative of The Great Dalmuti and Dilbert's Corporate Shuffle. In it, each player is ranked (and seated) according to his wealth (Poor / Thin Ice / Credit Crazy / Upper Crust / Money to Burn / Rich).&#10;&#10;The entire deck of 62 cards is dealt out, minus two cards. The first and last player exchange two cards, the next-to-first and next-to-last exchange one. The player to the left of the dealer (the Rich player) begins by playing a set of cards (quantity and face value). The following player can either play the same quantity but higher value or pass. This round continues until all pass; after which another round starts. Players rank (for the next hand) in the order in which they go out.&#10;&#10;Score is kept for the agreed upon number of hands (no more than 10). Poor scores 1, Thin Ice 2, etc. High score wins.&#10;&#10;Interestingly, the value 5 cards are wild in the sense that a single 5 can represent any number of fives. When played to start a round, the following player determines the quantity. The other cards are Zillionaire (4 in deck), Millionaire (4), Bankroll (3; if played on top of a Bankrupt card, cannot be beaten), Bankrupt (3; can only be beaten by a Bankroll), Bump (3; forces the player to your left to Pass), 8 through 1 (6 of each except for Fives, of which there are only 3).&#10;&#10;";1987;6.00208;1.0;3;6;45;8;Card Game;close relative great dalmuti dilbert corporate shuffle rank seat accord wealth poor thin ice credit crazy upper crust money burn rich entire deck card deal minus card exchange card exchange left dealer rich begin set card quantity face value follow quantity high value pass continue pass start rank hand order keep agree number hand poor thin ice etc high interestingly value card wild sense single represent number five start follow determine quantity card zillionaire deck millionaire bankroll bankrupt card beat bankrupt beat bankroll bump force left pass five
2468;Zero Zap;"The object of this game is to score Sets and Runs of cards and trying to go out first. First to score 50 wins.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt 7 of the 108 cards. On your turn, you either draw 1 or 2 cards, or pick up one or more cards from the playing area (more on this later). Then you play your sets (3 or 4 cards of same color and value) and runs (3 to 7 consecutive cards of the same color) or increase already played sets and runs. Finally, you must discard a card; special cards are truly discarded once their effects are resolved; the other cards are discarded to the playing area, slightly overlapping each other in sequence. When you pick up a card from the playing area, it must be used to play a run or set and you must pick up any cards that follow it (were discarded after it).&#10;&#10;Going out scores a 5-point bonus and ends the round. All played sets and runs score (sets are worth 2 per card; runs are worth 1 per card); cards left in hand penalize you 1 point per card.&#10;&#10;The number cards (84) come in 3 colors and run from 1 to 7 (there are four of each). Wild cards (6) can replace any number card but cannot be played to form their own sets or runs. Double cards (3) are used to double the value of all of your sets and runs of a given color. The Special cards (14) do various things such as reshuffling the draw and discard decks, stealing a set, run or double, giving a card away, etc. The Zero Zap card (1), if left in your hand when someone goes out, zaps your score for that round to zero (Yikes!). However, if played as a Special to go out, it zaps someone else's (of your choosing) round score!&#10;&#10;";1987;5.30952;1.0;2;4;45;8;Card Game;object set run card try deal card draw card pick card area later set card color value run consecutive card color increase set run finally discard card special card truly discard effect resolve card discard area slightly overlap sequence pick card playing area run set pick card follow discard go bonus end set run set worth card run worth card card leave hand penalize card number card come color run wild card replace number card form set run double card double value set run give color special card thing reshuffle draw discard deck steal set run double give card away etc zero zap card leave hand go zap zero yike special zap choose
2469;Wildcatter;"&quot;The Authentic Oil &amp; Gas Exploration Game&quot; has an educational aspect to it, as the drilling success ratios, drilling depths, costs and monthly production figures were taken from the real world.&#10;&#10;The game is played within the U.S. and Alaska; the players lease properties and drill for oil and gas, trying to get rich.  On each lease, you must decide whether to go for shallow or deep wells --once a well has been drilled, even a dry hole, all future drilling must be done at the same depth, even if the lease changes hands.  The first few wells are Exploratory and have lesser chances of success; once a producing well has been drilled, further drilling is Developmental.  When you land on a player's lease, you buy its monthly oil production from him; landing on your own lease nets you double that amount (paid by the bank).  Payments also roll in every time you go around the board.&#10;&#10;Random events are injected by Wildcat and Blowout cards.  The rest of the game falls in line with what its design is: a Monopoly clone.  Big box with lots of fairly nice bits, however.&#10;&#10;";1981;5.44571;2.1429;2;8;120;8;Economic, Industry / Manufacturing;authentic oil amp gas exploration educational aspect drilling success ratio drilling depth cost monthly production figure take real world u alaska lease property drill oil gas try rich lease decide shallow deep well drill dry hole future drilling depth lease change hand well exploratory less chance success produce drill drilling developmental land lease buy monthly oil production land lease net double pay bank payment time random event inject wildcat blowout card rest fall line monopoly clone big box lot fairly nice bit
2470;The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen;"This not-quite-a-role-playing-game requires players to sit around telling fantastic (but completely true!) stories. Players may attempt to trip up another player's story by wagering a token (&quot;But the Prussian Army had dissolved by that time, m'lord, so you could not have possibly fought it single-handedly&quot;), whereas the storyteller must counter with another token (and an excuse) or swallow their pride and incorporate it into their story (with another excuse). There are also a few, minor details, mostly used to get boring storytellers to stop. The game is won after each player has told one story. Each player, in turn, gives *all* their tokens to another player they believe has told the best story--so collecting the most tokens doesn't make you the winner, it makes you be able to choose the winner. Of course, the best story-telling wins the game.&#10;&#10;Re-published 2002 (starting at Essen) by Krimsus KrimsKrams-Kiste as Die unfasslichen Abenteuer des Freiherrn von M&uuml;nchhausen.&#10;&#10;Is also listed on RPGGeek as The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen&#10;&#10;";1998;7.25103;1.4643;3;20;45;10;Adventure, Party Game;role playing require sit tell fantastic completely true story attempt trip story wager token prussian army dissolve time m lord possibly fight single handedly storyteller token excuse swallow pride incorporate story excuse minor detail boring storyteller stop tell story give token believe tell good story collect token doesn t winner make able choose winner course good story telling publish start essen krimsus krimskrams kiste die unfasslichen abenteuer des freiherrn von m uuml nchhausen list rpggeek extraordinary adventure baron munchausen

Movement is determined by dice roll as is combat when the player's piece is in the same square as a Zombie. Players must conserve bullets and protect their life counters. At the end of the turn a dice roll directs the player to move a number of Zombies one square (because they are the slow George Romero type).&#10;&#10;First player to reach the center of the Helipad tile and kill the Zombie there, or kill a total of 25 Zombies wins.

2476;Industrial Waste;"Industrial Waste is a fast but deep game designed by J&#195;&#188;rgen Strohm in which the players are running factories. Players buy materials, complete orders and invest money in technology improvements to earn VPs, but they need to keep an eye on their waste output. If players have too much waste in their factory dump they are liable to suffer an environmental disaster and have to pay hefty cleanup costs. Development of technological improvements requiring less waste, fewer resources, and reduced workforce are the key to this game.&#10;&#10;The game features bidding for resources, hand management and some drafting of cards to gain actions.

They hunt and gather food, make their tribal laws, and deal with natural disasters, but the object of the game is simple: Look after the children! In this game, the way to win is to have the most kids and do whatever you have to do to make sure they survive to adulthood. The players must know when to cooperate, and when to cut their losses and protect their own families. Players can re-create &ndash; and change &ndash; the earliest human societies by instituting their own laws and social patterns, and see what effects the rules of society have on their ability to survive and reproduce.&#10;&#10;With several copies of the game and a referee, it's possible to have several tribes playing at once, competing, trading, exchanging members, and even making war on each other.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.5271;2.0769;4;8;240;0;Prehistoric;tribe role playing lot like simulate way ancestor live long ago cave man woman hunt gather food tribal law deal natural disaster object simple look child way kid sure survive adulthood know cooperate cut loss protect family create ndash change ndash early human society institute law social pattern effect society survive reproduce copy referee possible tribe compete trading exchange member make war
2482;Zaxxon;"The galaxy is in peril! The evil robot Zaxxon and its legion of followers have conquered an asteroid belt! It's your job to ward off this threat before it's too late.&#10;Published in 1983, the Zaxxon Board Game was one of Milton Bradley&rsquo;s numerous attempts to translate video games to board games.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY THE GAME: &#10;1. ROLLING THE DIE: both players roll their die AT THE SAME TIME. Reroll the die if there is a tie. On EACH turn, the player rolling the Lower Number on the die ALWAYS plays first. Then the player rolling the Higher Number plays second. &#10;2. USING THE SPINNER: the player rolling the Lower Number spins the spinner. The spinner controls enemy fire directed at fighter planes from missile silos and gun turrets (later in the game the spinner will also control the movement of Zaxxon). When RED is spun, any plane that is in or enters a missile silo area CONTAINING A MISSILE SILO is shot down and returned to its home base. When BLUE is spun, any plane that is in a gun turret area CONTAINING A GUN TURRET is shot down and returned to its home base. If a missile silo or a gun turret has been shot and removed from the board, there is no enemy fire from that area so any planes in that area are safe. Notice that the missile silo areas are surrounded by a red border and the gun turret areas are surrounded by a blue border. See Figures 5A and 5B for locations. When WHITE is spun, all planes are safe. Please Note: if your plane is shot down by a missile silo or gun turret in the inner fortress, return it to a RESTART space in your outer fortress. &#10;3. ORDER OF PLAY: after spinning the spinner, the player who rolled the Lower Number moves his or her plane or planes according to the die count just rolled. Then the player who rolled the Higher Number moves his or her plane or planes according to the die count just rolled. You can move one of your planes the full amount on the die or move both of your planes, splitting the die count between them in any combination&#10;4. HOW A FIGHTER PLANE MOVES: a fighter plane can move from one space to any adjacent space by die count as shown in Figure 6. A plane can change direction or land on the same space more than once on the same turn. A plane cannot pass over or land on a space occupied by another plane. A fighter plane can &quot;fly&quot; at High Altitude or Low Altitude by raising or lowering it on its base. Each change in altitude (either High to Low or Low to High) counts as ONE on your die count. Your plane must be at Low Altitude to shoot a target and at High Altitude to cross a wall.&#10;&#10;HOW TO WIN THE GAME: &#10;Be the first player to destroy your enemy targets and shoot Zaxxon with both of your fighter planes.&#10;&#10;";1982;4.37138;1.1818;2;2;30;7;Aviation / Flight, Children's Game, Fighting, Science Fiction, Video Game Theme;galaxy peril evil robot zaxxon legion follower conquer asteroid belt job ward threat late publish zaxxon milton bradley rsquo numerous attempt translate video die die time reroll die tie low number die high number second spinner low number spin spinner spinner enemy fire direct fighter plane missile silos gun turret later spinner zaxxon red spin plane enter missile silo area contain missile silo shoot return home base blue spin plane gun turret area contain gun turret shoot return home base missile silo gun turret shoot remove enemy fire area plane area safe notice missile silo area surround red border gun turret area surround blue border figure b location white spin plane safe note plane shoot missile silo gun turret inner fortress return restart space outer fortress order spin spinner low number plane plane accord die count high number plane plane accord die count plane die plane split die count combination fighter plane fighter plane space adjacent space die count show figure plane change direction land space plane pass land space occupy plane fighter plane fly high altitude low altitude raise lower base change altitude high low low high count die count plane low altitude shoot target high altitude cross wall destroy enemy target shoot zaxxon fighter plane

Roll a die each turn for movement, with players trying to choose the optimal routes. The first player to visit all their cities and return home wins.&#10;&#10;The limitation of using only 1 mode of transport per turn, as well as increasing cost for air based on distance, increases the analysis and decisions required.

2486;Flipop;"The Flipop board consists of a 5x5 grid of spaces.  In each of the 16 intersections between four spaces, there is a post holding a door that can swing around so that it blocks access between any adjacent two spaces of the four spaces around it.  Each player has five balls on his side of the board.  The object is to move the balls across the board, at which point they are removed from the game.  To move, you must push a ball through a door.  If there is a ball in the space beyond the door, it will be pushed -- this can cascade indefinitely.  But a move is only legal as long as each ball lands either in an empty space or goes through another door -- balls cannot touch each other.  The winner is either the first person to remove all his balls from the board, or the player with the fewest balls left when no legal moves remain.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.86842;1.5;2;2;20;0;Abstract Strategy;flipop consist x grid space intersection space post hold door swing block access adjacent space space ball object ball remove push ball door ball space door push cascade indefinitely legal long ball land space go door ball touch winner person remove ball few ball leave legal remain

But they still haunt the house.  You must try to find out who was murdered, by what means and why.&#10;&#10;The cards include Motive cards, No Clue cards and a single &quot;It's a Mystery to Me&quot; card.  In addition, there are cards that can be assembled side by side to form larger pictures: the six guests (Cleopatra, Napoleon, etc. --they were costumed, you see; in four pieces), four weapons (also in four pieces) and Alfred Hitchcock (in six pieces).  Seven cards are dealt to each player, the rest into the house's rooms.  You enter a room by exact count, except that a 7, 11 or doubles allows you to go directly to the spot of your choice.  When you reach a room, you pick up the top card there and discard either it or another card from your hand to the &quot;Lawn&quot; --off the board.  These cards are laid face down without overlapping each other but are shown to the other players as they're laid down.  Later, you may try to recover a Lawn card by showing a card from your hand of the appropriate type (a piece of a guest, for example) and then pointing to a Lawn card and picking it up.  If you remembered right, you may repeat the procedure.  You can also claim cards from other players by meeting them in the house and &quot;accusing them&quot; of withholding a particular card (this is what the No Clue cards are defence for).  Once the rooms are empty, everyone gathers in the hall and play is speeded up.&#10;&#10;First player to assemble a Ghost, Weapon and Motive OR Alfred and &quot;It's a Mystery to Me&quot; wins.&#10;&#10;";1958;5.73407;1.2222;2;4;45;12;Memory, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Murder / Mystery;alfre hitchcock present time people way costume party take shelter storm haunted house see alive haunt house try find murder mean card include motive card clue card single mystery card addition card assemble form large picture guest cleopatra napoleon etc costume piece weapon piece alfred hitchcock piece seven card deal rest house room enter room exact count double allow directly spot reach room pick card discard card hand lawn card lay face overlap show lay later try recover lawn card show card hand appropriate piece guest example lawn card pick remember right repeat procedure claim card meet house accuse withhold particular card clue card defence room gather hall speed assemble ghost weapon motive alfred mystery

2497;Goldrush-City;"Premiering at Essen 2001, a game of gold digging and city building. Players take turns revealing event, resource and bandit cards from the deck. After the events are resolved, the players bid for the resources. Then the active player uses his action points and resources to acquire building permits, acquire tools or erect buildings which differ in their resource costs and advantages conferred. Bandits may also be used to further the player's goal, but may backfire if the dice are not friendly. Then players engage in a subgame somewhat akin to Blackjack -- but with a greater range of results -- to distribute gold useful for the next auction. What's tricky is to take in more gold diggers than anyone else, but not to take so many that the ensuing brawl wipes out all of the profits. The eventual winner is the player who has managed to construct the best set of buildings with bonuses for achieving multiple buildings of the same type. This player is elected Mayor of Goldrush City.&#10;&#10;Created by the designer of Strand-Cup.&#10;&#10;";2001;4.74103;1.8333;3;5;30;10;American West, Card Game, City Building;premiere essen gold digging city building reveal event resource bandit card deck event resolve bid resource active use action resource acquire building permit acquire tool erect building differ resource cost advantage confer bandit backfire dice friendly engage subgame somewhat akin blackjack great range result distribute gold useful auction tricky gold digger ensue brawl wipe profit eventual winner manage construct good set building bonus achieve multiple building elect mayor goldrush city create designer strand cup

2499;Equate;"&quot;Scrabble with math&quot; is how this game is generally described, and the description is apt.  The board is much like a Scrabble board, including spaces equivalent to &quot;double-word score&quot; and &quot;triple-letter score&quot;.  The difference is that, instead of placing words formed of letters, players of Equate place equations formed of numbers and symbols on the board.  The beginners game (consisting mostly of addition and subtraction of integers) is pretty simple, but the standard game, bringing in multiplication, division, and fractions, can be something of a brain-burner.&#10;&#10;";1996;5.54102;1.9167;2;4;120;8;Math;scrabble math generally describe description apt like scrabble include space equivalent double word triple letter difference instead place word form letter equate place equation form number symbol beginner consist addition subtraction integer pretty simple standard bring multiplication division fraction brain burner
2500;Express Chess;"Based on when Blackbox originally put it out, this could be considered Chess's answer to collectible card games.  Cards represent typical chess pieces, and the board is defined by the rows of cards originally laid out.  Throughout the game players capture each others' pieces as in normal chess, but can continually add to the board from the cards they hold in their hands.&#10;&#10;Additional rules, such as the pawn combo (after moving a pawn, you can make a second move through or into the vacated space), add new elements over classic chess.  Pawn combos together with piece limits and placement restrictions serve to balance the value of the different pieces.  A small number of cards have special powers on them, further changing the rules of the game.&#10;&#10;";1996;4.76885;1.0;2;2;0;8;Abstract Strategy, Card Game;base blackbox originally consider chess answer collectible card card represent typical chess piece define row card originally lay capture piece normal chess continually add card hold hand additional pawn combo pawn second vacate space add new element classic chess pawn combo piece limit restriction serve balance value different piece small number card special power change
2501;Global Chess;"Global Chess is pure chess with 64 squares, traditional pieces and traditional moves. The game of chess was developed when armies fought on open fields in distinct formations and the entire battle could be seen from a single vantage point. As warefare and technology have advanced, battles are fought over the limb of the horizon with no edges to the battlefield. This is the transformational premise of Global Chess. There is no backline and no sideline on the Global Chess board. There is nowhere to hide.&#10;&#10;Think of a 64 square chessboard wrapped around a globe. Now you can play chess around a sphere with no edges to the game. The problem is that it's difficult to see all the squares at the same time and understand your options. The Global Chess game separates the globe at the equator and flattens them into hemispheres that are geared together. By turning the game you rotate the hemispheres against each other to examine the crossing point of a piece in it's possible trajectories across the hemisphere or through the poles. Turning the board does not alter the relationship of the game pieces to each other.&#10;&#10;The easy to understand rules of chess as they pertain to a global playing surface are explained in text and graphic form. The possible strategy is yet to be written! The board is annotated to record game play.&#10;&#10;";1997;6.34211;5.0;2;2;90;12;Abstract Strategy;global chess pure chess square traditional piece traditional chess develop army fight open field distinct formation entire battle see single vantage warefare technology advanced battle fight limb horizon edge battlefield transformational premise global chess backline sideline global chess hide think square chessboard wrap globe chess sphere edge problem difficult square time understand option global chess separate globe equator flatten hemisphere gear rotate hemisphere examine crossing piece possible trajectory hemisphere pole alter relationship piece easy understand chess pertain global playing surface explain text graphic form possible strategy write annotate record

2507;LibertÃ©;"Libert&eacute; covers the French Revolution from 1789 and the meeting of the Estates General to the Directory and Bonaparte&rsquo;s coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat in 1799. &#10; The game is played in four turns. In each turn there will be a variable number of rounds, followed by an election to see which faction becomes the government. There are three factions, the Radicals (red), the Moderates (blue), and the Royalists (white).  The most common action is for a player to place faction blocks on the board.  He shows he controls these blocks by placing one of his tokens on top of the stack.&#10;&#10;The cards are divided into two sets, set 'A' and 'B'.  The 'A' deck is used first and tends to favor the moderates and Royalists.  Once this deck has been exhausted the 'B' deck comes into play, which tends to favor the radicals.&#10;&#10;The election is triggered when all of one type of faction block has been exhausted.  The faction blocks will determine which faction forms the next government.  Players are attempting to score victory points by having the most influence in the government and opposition.  Points can also be picked up in later turns for being the general in charge at a victorious battle, and for winning elections in specific provinces.&#10;&#10;Normally the player with the most victory points will win.  However, there are two sudden death game end conditions that may alter the outcome.  The first is a radical electoral landslide, triggered by the red faction gaining 17 or more votes.  The second is  successful Royalist counter-revolution, precipitated by Royalist control of seven counter-revolutionary provinces.  In both cases, victory is determined by a different set of criteria, in which accrued victory points do not count.  The player who is ahead on points must be aware that one mistake could lead to defeat at the hands of the Jacobins or Royalists!&#10;&#10;It is likely that you will never have played a game quite like this one and you may find yourself wondering what strategies to employ.

2509;Dark Heaven Apocalypse;"Dark Heaven: Apocalypse (DH:A) is a miniatures game set in the fantasy world of Adon.  Players assume the roles of commanders of armies of fantastic races such as humans, vampires, dwarves, elves, etc., fighting among themselves and against the ultimate villains, the Dire-Dead, who are led by the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.&#10;&#10;In DH:A, the 10-sided die is used to generate the random results to determine the outcome of battles, spells, and incidents.  Players build up armies of equivalent point values to fight each other.  The point value of a basic unit can be cheap, but can be increased by giving the unit better weapons, skills and spells.  Players are free to customize the standard units presented in the rulebook or create their own.  Rules also cover artillery, morale, chariots and elephants.&#10;&#10;The battles are split into turns, which are further split into class movement phases (where increasingly more mobile units act ahead of slower ones).  During a turn, Class 1 units (the most mobile) act first.  The player who won the roll for initiative at the start of the turn enacts his or her orders for her Class 1 units before the opponent moves theirs.  They then repeat the same for their Class 2, Class 3, and lastly Class 4 units.  Individual figures can be grouped together with a leader in combat, supporting their leader in its fight and dying together with it if its roll fails against an opponent.&#10;&#10;The winning conditions for a battle can include total destruction of the enemy, seizing an objective, or fleeing the battlefield after being surrounded.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.35714;2.3333;2;2;300;14;Adventure, Fantasy, Miniatures, Wargame;dark heaven apocalypse dh miniature set fantasy world adon assume role commander army fantastic race human vampire dwarf elve etc fight ultimate villain dire dead lead horseman apocalypse dh sided die generate random result determine outcome battle spell incident build army equivalent value fight value basic unit cheap increase give unit well weapon skill spell free customize standard unit present rulebook create cover artillery morale chariot elephant battle split split class increasingly mobile unit act ahead slow one class unit mobile act initiative start enact order class unit opponent theirs repeat class class lastly class unit individual figure group leader combat support leader fight die fail opponent condition battle include total destruction enemy seize flee battlefield surround
2510;Playboss;"Playboss is an exciting board-game that simulates the many real-life business situations in which directors and managers make their decisions. Each player in this game is a businessman who has the opportunity of buying machines and raw materials, selling his products, paying taxes, raising loans or introducing rationalization schemes, and generally experiencing the ups and downs of everyday business life.&#10;&#10;Before starting, players agree the duration of the game. The player with the greatest net assets at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;The board comprises a circuit of 42 spaces of 5 different types: decision spaces on which the player can choose to buy raw material, purchase capital equipment, manufacture goods or sell goods, research &amp; development spaces which allow investment for productivity improvement or risk reduction, risk spaces which require the drawing of a risk card, additional cost spaces, and depreciation spaces.&#10;&#10;Each player has a factory card on which are placed machines, computers, raw materials and finished goods. At the start of the game, priced slots in the center of the board are filled with the goods: these slots are emptied and filled as goods are bought as raw material and sold as finished goods. The buying and selling price is determined by the next available filled or empty slots, though players can bid competitively for the purchase or sale.&#10;&#10;The Economy Game uses the basic mechanism and many features.&#10;&#10;";1969;6.3354;2.5294;3;9;180;16;Economic, Industry / Manufacturing, Negotiation;playboss exciting simulate real life business situation director manager decision businessman opportunity buy machine raw material sell product pay taxis raise loan introduce rationalization scheme generally experience up down everyday business life start agree duration great net asset end winner comprise circuit space different decision space choose buy raw material purchase capital equipment manufacture good sell good research amp development space allow investment productivity improvement risk reduction risk space require drawing risk card additional cost space depreciation space factory card place machine computer raw material finish good start price slot center fill good slot empty fill good buy raw material sell finish good buying selling price determine available fill slot bid competitively purchase sale economy use basic mechanism

2516;Man O' War;"Man O' War is the game of Raging Sea Battles in the Warhammer World. As an admiral of an ocean-going war fleet you must command your ships - which can be either squadrons of Ships of the Line or heavily armored Men O' War and Independents, in the battle for supremacy of the high seas.&#10;&#10;Players choose fleets from the multitude of races of the Warhammer world. Every ship is represented by a template showing individual areas, each with a description of the items (masts, cannons etc.) in those areas - as well as the damage that they can take before being destroyed. Each location has a value that must be rolled to hit that area when attacked, along with another value that can be rolled by the defending player to possibly prevent any damage that might occur. Ships are classified one of three ways. They are either Ship of the Line (SOL) - which are designed to move as a group of three (each moving and fighting to completion before continuing on with the next ship in the squadron), a Man O' War (MOW)- which are single ships that are much larger, more powerful and crewed by larger numbers than a single SOL classed ship, or finally as an Independent (IND) - which are used individually like a Man O' War but are more in line in strength and abilities to that of a Ship of the Line.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each turn, players determine Initiative by each rolling a die which determines who will go 1st in each phase - if the numbers are different, or how the wind direction changes if they both roll the same number. If the wind changes, the initiative roll and resolution is repeated until one player wins the die roll.&#10;&#10;Players then conduct the Magic Phase with each Admiral having his Wizard make one spell attempt if desired based on the Initiative order previously determined. If a spell is successful, the other player can try and dispel that spell just cast - but only if they have a corresponding type of magic to make the attempt.&#10;&#10;Next comes the Battle phase - which is also based on the previously determined initiative roll. Players alternate between phases of Movement/Combat, each choosing a single MOW, IND or SOL Squadron and then conducting movement (if desired) and/or making attacks, before passing the turn sequence back to their opponent. This process continues until all ships have been activated on both sides. Once that has occurred, the turn is over and a series of quick turn ending/record keeping events occurs before moving to the next turn. Game play continues for a predetermined time or until one side is destroyed, surrenders or flees the battlefield.&#10;&#10;The Main Boxed set contained 2 sets of 3 Wargalleys for the Empire and another 2 sets of 3 Wargalleys that were considered Pirates. THe main rules also included Fleet Lists and specific rules for each of the 6 Warhammer Races included in the game: The Imperial (Empire), Bretonnian, Dwarf, High Elf, Dark Elf and Orc. Each Race had had unique features, weapons and abilities that made every battle a new challenge for both players. Rules for a Campaign as well as additional pieces like playing pieces like Shoreforts were also included in the main ruleset.&#10;&#10;There were two separate expansions to the main game. The first was Plaguefleet which added rules and templates for the Chaos fleets of Khorne, Slaanesh, Tzeentch and Nurgle (collectively known as a Plaguefleet), the Skaven and finally the Chaos Dwarfs. This expansion effectively doubled the number of available fleets for the game. This expansion also included color templates for the original 6 races as well (Imperial, Bretonnian, Dwarf, High Elf, Dark Elf and Orc).&#10;&#10;The 2nd expansion Sea of Blood mainly introduced new rules for Airpower, Sea Monsters &amp; Beasts and Allies as well as new ships for the Dwarfs and Imperial fleets. The inclusion of the Norse fleet wrapped up the content for this expansion.&#10;&#10;Finally, complete rules for an Undead fleet - as well as some expansion rules for a few of the other races, were included in several of the issues of Game Workshop's Citadel Journal magazine.&#10;&#10;A wide variety of miniatures were produced to represent the many ships detailed in the main game and expansion sets but no miniatures were ever officially made for the Undead fleet. Assembling and painting the miniatures gave the game a feeling of being &quot;collectible&quot; as well as being a hobby in itself. Many players have created customized ships and new ships (and even complete fleets) including rules, ships templates and completed miniatures. The largest collection of these creations is housed at Groups IO and there is a very active Facebook Page as well.&#10;&#10;Man O War is still considered by many GW fan's as one of Games Workshop's best games. The wide variety of different ships, rules for each race and relatively small investment to get up and running contributed greatly to Man O War's popularity.

You&rsquo;ll try to grab onto Handholds and land on Safe Rocks to keep your man high and dry.  Because all along the track, Quicksand pits lie in wait to suck your adventurer down, down, down --piece by piece by piece!  And you&rsquo;ll always keep an eye out for the sneaky Alligator that lurks in the swamp --and on the special Quicksand die-- ready to scare an unlucky player backwards on the track.&#10;&#10;The player pawns represent a mustachioed archetypical British explorer, and they're in parts.

2524;StarForce 'Alpha Centauri': Interstellar Conflict in the 25th Century;"Adapted from the box:&#10;&#10;The game is a simulation of events within a conjectural future history in which telekinesis is used to move ships through space. It is played on a map which displays 74 star systems in a three-dimensional &quot;sphere&quot; of space measuring roughly 40 light years in diameter, with Earth's home system at the center. A grid of hexagons printed over the map is used to regulate movement and position of pieces.  Pieces' exact locations are not known until they &quot;meet&quot; in the same three-dimensional &quot;hex space&quot;.&#10;&#10;The pieces in the game represent groups of four interstellar spaceships (StarForces) and space stations (StarGates). Each Player maneuvers his pieces (via Stellar Shifting) to engage those of the enemy. Movement is plotted and executed simultaneously. The game proceeds this way (for a specified number of turns) as the players try to achieve the objectives set forth in the rules. No prior knowledge is required to play the game - just a little ingenuity and common sense.&#10;&#10;Battles take place when units are in the same three-dimensional location.  In the Basic Game, the attacking Player compares the total variable strengths of the involved units and consults a simple probability table to determine the outcome of each battle.  In the Advanced Game, a small tactical maneuver map is used. When enemy forces engage on the main map, they are transferred to the tactical display. Here they move (in three dimensions), attack and defend using a fixed number of action points per tactical turn.&#10;&#10;Combat outcomes result in pieces not being destroyed but being &quot;randomised&quot;; usually to a location far from all the action.&#10;&#10;&#10;Part of the StarForce Trilogy box set, along with Outreach and StarSoldier. There are also special rules to use Starsoldier as a tactical game for StarForce.&#10;&#10;";1974;6.4098;3.4444;1;3;240;12;Science Fiction, Wargame;adapt box simulation event conjectural future history telekinesis ship space map display star dimensional sphere space measure roughly light year diameter earth home center grid hexagon print map regulate position piece piece exact location know meet dimensional hex space piece represent group interstellar spaceship starforce space station stargate maneuver piece stellar shift engage enemy plot execute simultaneously proceed way specified number try achieve set forth prior knowledge require little ingenuity common sense battle place unit dimensional location basic attack compare total variable strength involved unit consult simple probability table determine outcome battle advanced small tactical maneuver map enemy force engage main map transfer tactical display dimension attack defend fix number action tactical combat outcome result piece destroy randomise usually location far action starforce trilogy box set outreach starsoldi special use starsoldi tactical starforce

2542;Gargon;"Contents - one deck of 102 Gargon cards in 6 suits, plus 18 bonus cards. One rulebook.&#10;&#10;Gargon is fantasy themed card game for 3-5 players. There are 6 suits of Gargon cards, each representing a fantasy creature, with values 0 to 15. The cards also show amulet symbols, with the low value cards having more, the highest value cards having none. At the end of the game, the player who has won the most cards in each suit gets a bonus card worth ten points, or five points if tied - this is what the 18 bonus cards are for. Each amulet is also worth one point. The zero value cards have no amulets themselves, but double the amulet count for that suit, or quadruple them if both 0 value cards in that suit have been won.&#10;&#10;Ten cards are dealt to each player, and the rest are split into two equal draw piles, face down, in the center of the board. The draw piles are spread out so that the backs can be seen, showing the color of the suits. Players must also hold their cards so that the backs are visible.&#10;&#10;Each round the start player plays up to three cards face down, (but never three of the same suit), and the other players must follow in turn with the same number of cards in the same distribution, or pass. There is no requirement to follow suit in general, but if, for example, the start player puts down three cards in three different suits, the other players must also play three cards in three different suits. The last player is restricted to suits that have already been played. Anybody who passed draws 1-3 cards from the two draw piles in the center. A battle is then resolved for each suit that has been played, with the highest card winning the battle and going into its owner&rsquo;s stash of Gargon cards to be scored at the end. The losing cards are discarded and the players draw replacements.&#10;&#10;If anybody played two cards of a suit, a second battle is fought with the weakest of the pair.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one of the draw piles is exhausted, and the current round is played out, then the totals are scored.&#10;&#10;";2001;5.98267;1.7463;3;5;45;10;Card Game, Fantasy;content deck gargon card suit plus bonus card rulebook gargon fantasy card suit gargon card represent fantasy creature value card amulet symbol low value card have high value card have end card suit get bonus card worth tie bonus card amulet worth zero value card amulet double amulet count suit quadruple value card suit card deal rest split equal draw pile face center draw pile spread back see show color suit hold card back visible start card face suit follow number card distribution pass requirement follow suit general example start put card different suit card different suit restrict suit anybody pass draw card draw pile center battle resolve suit high card battle go owner rsquo stash gargon card end card discard draw replacement anybody card suit second battle fight weak pair end draw pile exhaust current total

2548;Loopino;"A card-flicking card game in which a target card depicting some tasty fish is placed on the table and players attempt to flick (actually, according to the rules, this is a wrist-toss rather than a finger-flick) cards depicting dolphins as close to the target as possible - the twisting motion of the flicked cards is supposed to represent the playful antics of the dolphins. A crosshair appears in the corner of each card, and distance is measured by the closest crosshair on the flicked card in relation to the closest crosshair on the target card. The number of cards to be scored is determined by the number on the closest card to the target (i.e. if a &quot;4&quot; card is closest to the target, the four closest cards all will score). Each card scores a number of points equal to the face value of the card multiplied by the number of crosshair symbols on the card that remain uncovered. If all four crosshairs on the target are covered, the player covering the last takes a penalty, as does any player causing the target card to fall off the table. Suggested game duration is as many rounds as the number of players; highest point total wins.&#10;&#10;";1997;4.09524;1.0;2;10;10;6;Card Game;card flicking card target card depict tasty fish place table attempt flick actually accord wrist tos finger flick card depict dolphin close target possible twist motion flicked card suppose represent playful antic dolphin crosshair appear corner card distance measure close crosshair flicked card relation close crosshair target card number card determine number close card target e card close target close card card number equal face value card multiply number crosshair symbol card remain uncovered crosshair target cover cover take penalty cause target card fall table suggest duration number high total

2558;Comeback;"Another in the line of very small card games by Reinhard Staupe. The deck consists of four suits of cards numbered 1 to 7. The 1s have three stars, the 2s have two stars and all other cards have one star. Players start with 150 points (which serves as a starting score and a money pool for bidding). For 2 players, use 16 cards, for 3 players use 21 cards, for 4 players use 24 cards (so that players do not know which cards are in play) and these are auctioned off one at a time. Bid increments must be at least as great as the number of the card being auctioned but can be more - i.e. while bidding on a card with the number 4, a bid of four would require a bid of 8 or more from the next bidder). The first bid can be lower, the same or higher than the number of the card.  Bidding goes clockwise around the table.  First bid also moves clockwise around the table. When all cards have been auctioned, suits are scored separately for each player by adding the card numbers and multiplying that figure by the total number of stars in the suit. Scores for each suit are added to any remaining points from a players' starting pool (points remaining from the original pool of 150) to determine the final score. Comeback was nominated for Spiel des Jahres in Germany in 1997.&#10;&#10;";1996;5.88372;1.6;2;4;20;9;Card Game;line small card reinhard staupe deck consist suit card number star star card star start serve starting money pool bidding use card use card use card know card auction time bid increment great number card auction e bid card number bid require bid bidder bid low high number card bidding go clockwise table bid clockwise table card auction suit separately add card number multiply figure total number star suit suit add remain start pool remain original pool determine final comeback nominate spiel des jahre germany

The die rolls are 1, 2, 3, S, S, S; an S is used to start a timer from the starting row (flipping it and advancing one space) or to flip an already running one.

2574;Classic Warlord;"Originally self published by Mike Hayes in 1974 as &quot;The Warlord&quot; - this edition came in a red box.  It was reprinted by Mike in 1978 as &quot;Warlord&quot; and came in a blue box.  It was released by Games Workshop in 1980 in a smaller version (only western half of the Warlord board) as &quot;Apocalypse&quot;.&#10;&#10;As of October 2012, the game is now available again as Classic Warlord, a limited edition in a gold box, with two sets of rules and an FAQ booklet, counters in pouches for up to seven players and a single large D6, along with the full eight-section mapboard. This version sees the game revert back to the original Warlord with new rules to reflect over thirty years of play.&#10;&#10;Objective - to dominate the board and destroy opponents.&#10;&#10;Mechanics - similar to Risk, you get more armies for the more territories you hold. Allocation is on basis of territory held: city, industrial or agricultural.  Mountainous, waste, and sea spaces gain you no armies.&#10;&#10;Gaining territories through combat is an elegant use of cunning and bluff.  Instead of rolling dice, the attacker simply chooses with a single D6 how many pieces they wish to attack with (subject to restrictions based on terrain).  The D6 is then concealed and the defender attempts to guess it.  If they guess correctly the attacker loses that number of armies; if they guess wrongly one defender is lost, and if the territory is now left unoccupied the selected number of attacking pieces or greater are advanced into the territory to capture it.&#10;&#10;Alliances are allowed (and can be broken at will).&#10;&#10;A-bombs and the more devastating H-bombs are used in the game.  A-bombs are a reward for successful combat, and H-bombs are gained as a result of launching an A-bomb.  These can be placed to act as deterrents against other players, and can be launched to clear enemy territory prior to an advance.  Nuclear damage however will render map spaces impassable for the remainder of the game.&#10;&#10;";2012;7.17318;2.2619;2;7;360;12;Modern Warfare, Wargame;originally self publish mike hayes warlord come red box reprint mike warlord come blue box release workshop small western half warlord apocalypse october available classic warlord limited gold box set faq booklet pouch seven single large d section mapboard see revert original warlord new reflect thirty year dominate destroy opponent similar risk army territory hold allocation basis territory hold city industrial agricultural mountainous waste sea space gain army gain territory combat elegant use cunning bluff instead dice attacker simply choose single d piece wish attack subject restriction base terrain d conceal defender attempt guess guess correctly attacker number army guess wrongly defender territory leave unoccupie select number attack piece great advance territory capture alliance allow break bomb devastating h bomb bomb reward successful combat h bomb gain result launch bomb place act deterrent launch clear enemy territory prior advance nuclear damage render map space impassable remainder

Each player pursues the goal of developing as many Achievements of the best quality as possible, by placing his own counters onto the game board.

2580;Persian Gulf: Battle for the Middle East;"Persian Gulf: Battle for the Middle East:&#10;&#10;Persian Gulf uses the same rules as the other games in the Third World War series to show a different aspect of modern warfare operations in the deserts and mountains of the middle east.&#10;&#10;Persian Gulf includes a special &quot;game within a game&quot;, covering the diplomatic, political, and military maneuvers by the Soviet Union and the United States in the Middle East before - and leading to - the general outbreak of the Third World War. Both sides try to gain control of the various Iranian factions and influence the other Middle Eastern nations. As the superpowers' confrontation continues, fighting breaks out between committed factions. Either side can decide to send troops to support their factions; the U.S. may send the Rapid Deployment Force while the Soviet Union may use its forces along its southern borders and in Afghanistan. Each move, however, escalates the conflict until the superpowers are directly fighting one another in the Middle East and their alliances in Europe are mobilizing for war.&#10;&#10;The four game maps cover the Persian Gulf region in detail. Centered on Iran and Iraq, the maps include bordering areas of Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the USSR, and Afghanistan. Mountains and sand dominate this area of the world, and wilderness rules show the effects of the scarcity of roads on military operations. &#10;Vying for control of the nations on these maps are the regional forces and those of the superpowers. These forces range greatly in capabilities: from the poorly-equipped and trained Iranian Revolutionary Guards and Soviet-controlled Afghan Army to the capable Turks to the elite Israeli and Jordanian intervention contingents. The Soviets have large forces available in their southern border regions and in Afghanistan. The small but strong U.S. RDF is on hand, and they can call on B-52 strikes for support.&#10;&#10;The rules cover the special political and military situations of the Middle East and the various Arab and Arab-Israeli rivalries are shown. Victory conditions take account of the oil resources of the Gulf. Additional rules allow Persian Gulf to be combined and played with the other three games in the Third World War series.&#10;&#10;";1986;7.40206;3.4815;2;2;300;12;Modern Warfare, Wargame;persian gulf battle middle east persian gulf use world war series different aspect modern warfare operation desert mountain middle east persian gulf include special cover diplomatic political military maneuver soviet union united states middle east lead general outbreak world war side try gain iranian faction influence middle eastern nation superpower confrontation continue fight break committed faction decide send troop support faction u send rapid deployment force soviet union use force southern border afghanistan escalate conflict superpower directly fight middle east alliance europe mobilize war map cover persian gulf region detail center iran iraq map include border area turkey saudi arabia ussr afghanistan mountain sand dominate area world wilderness effect scarcity road military operation vie nation map regional force superpower force range greatly capability poorly equip train iranian revolutionary guard soviet afghan army capable turk elite israeli jordanian intervention contingent soviet large force available southern border region afghanistan small strong u rdf hand b strike support cover special political military situation middle east arab arab israeli rivalry show condition account oil resource gulf additional allow persian gulf combine world war series

In this variant, players can purchase additional cards to improve their hand.&#10;&#10;Each player receives the same amount of credit to start the game.

The credits they used to purchase the cards go into the pot.  After everyone had their chance to improve their hands (or had quit the round by folding), they reveal their improved 5-card hands and the player with the best hand (according to standard poker rules) takes all of the pot.  The next round then starts, repeating the anteing-and-improving-hand process.&#10;&#10;The game stops when one of the players cannot afford the ante; at that point, the player with the most credit is declared the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;";1982;5.856;1.5;1;6;45;10;Bluffing, Card Game;sid sackson temptation poker card poker purchase additional card improve hand receive credit start ante credit deal standard card hand take look purchase card increase cost e g additional card second improve hand credit purchase card pot chance improve hand quit fold reveal improve card hand good hand accord standard poker take pot start repeat anteing improve hand process stop afford ante credit declare winner

2596;Villa Paletti;"An architectural rush to the skies for 2 - 4 budding architects with a good head for heights from 8 years old.&#10;&#10;In the land where the Lemons bloom, there once lived a wise old sage, whose friends called him &quot;Paletti&quot; He only had one goal in life, to finish the wonderful castle in the sky that his grandfather had begun to build many years before, but which had been left unfinished when the ducats ran out. Paletti too had little money, but instead he had a marvelous plan. Why buy new columns when he could re-use the old ones that his Grandfather had built?  All he needed to do was remove some of those holding up the first floor, of which there were far too many in any case, and rebuild them further up, so that they could support new floors,  reaching up towards the skies!&#10;&#10;&quot;Excellent, Paletti&quot; shouted his friends, and they quickly started to work.

2598;Tank Battle;"The object of this game (a distant relative of Stratego) is to destroy your opponent's six tanks before he does the same to you.  In addition to your tanks, you deploy an Ammo Dump, a Fuel Dump, your HQ and five Anti-Tank guns (which do not move).&#10;&#10;Your tanks are numbered but the opponent knows not which is which.  You also deploy (by writing their coordinates on a scrap of paper) two land mines.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you first plot secretly (using a peg board) where you think your opponent's tanks will end their move.  Once you're ready, he moves.  If you guessed correctly, the tanks are killed.  (You get six such shots each turn)  You also have five special shots which can be fired only once each --they may be added piecemeal during any turn.  You lose a special shot whenever you lose an AT gun.&#10;&#10;You have 6 moves each turn, no more than 3 per tank (unless down to two or fewer tanks).  Tanks can only go sideways or forward but those that reach the opponent's starting row are marked with a flag and can now move backward.&#10;&#10;Tanks attack each other by orthogonal proximity, in Stratego fashion (higher numbered tank wins).  Tanks attack AT guns using a spinner.  The installations are destroyed by being overrun.  Losing the HQ clears your mines; losing the Ammo Dump means you only use as many pegs as you have tanks remaining; losing the Fuel Dump reduces your movement points from six to four.  Tanks die if they end up on an enemy mine square.&#10;&#10;Remade in to Mission Command Land&#10;&#10;";1975;5.53976;1.6458;2;2;30;8;Wargame, World War II;object distant relative stratego destroy opponent tank addition tank deploy ammo dump fuel dump hq anti tank gun tank number opponent know deploy write coordinate scrap paper land mine plot secretly peg think opponent tank end ready guess correctly tank kill shot special shot fire add piecemeal special shot gun tank few tank tank sideways forward reach opponent starting row mark flag backward tank attack orthogonal proximity stratego fashion high numbered tank tank attack gun spinner installation destroy overrun hq clear mine ammo dump mean use peg tank remain fuel dump reduce tank die end enemy square remade mission command land

2602;Solitaire for Two;"Solitaire for Two includes two games: one called Six-Suit Solitaire that was originally released as Indochine 2000, and a second titled Solitaire for Two that (despite the title) can be played with 2-4 players.&#10;&#10;Six-Suit Solitaire is a modified version of the solitaire game Klondike, with six suits in the game instead of four as well as three jokers (one in each color). As in Klondike, players try to remove all tiles from play by creating stacks from Ace to King, but unlike in Klondike players have an incentive to keep Aces in play rather than removing them; if a player has one Ace in play, then he can move Queens to empty columns in addition to Kings, and with two or more Aces in play he can also move Jacks to empty columns. A player can place only the rightmost tile in the &quot;talon&quot; &ndash; the row of exposed tiles from the stock &ndash; but if he cashes in a joker, he can move any tile in the talon to the rightmost position.&#10;&#10;Solitaire for Two plays similarly to Six-Suit Solitaire, but the players take turns drawing tiles from the stock &ndash; three at a time &ndash; and trying to place them in the layout and score as many tiles as possible. Players score points for each tile they lay off; for playing all three tiles drawn; for moving columns of five, seven, nine or eleven tiles; and for other specialized situations.

2606;Dover Patrol;"This game DOVER PATROL by Harry Gibson is a wonderful Naval themed and early version of a type of hidden tactics game of skill. It was sold alongside the similar L'Attaque and Aviation: The Aerial Tactics Game of Attack and Defence and a more complicated game called Tri-Tactics designed as an incorporation of all three, by Gibsons and marketed together at the time as Series: The Big Four (Gibsons).&#10;&#10;Note: L'Attaque was patented in 1909 in France by Mademoiselle Hermance Edan, the U.K. distribution rights for which were acquired in 1925 by Gibsons. Dover Patrol was launched in 1911, whereas the original H. P. Gibson & Sons company was registered in 1919. Prior to that, The International Card Company operated between 1903 and 1919, when Harry Percy Gibson purchased ICC to form his company. Whether Harry Gibson designed the game is therefore open to some doubt.&#10;&#10;The game play of Dover Patrol is very much like L'Attaque, which forms the basis of the near-identical game Stratego by Jumbo, published in 1946 after World War II when the patent would have expired. Gibsons themselves had to effectively &lsquo;start again&rsquo; around that time having had their premises destroyed in the Blitz.&#10;&#10;The board, which supposedly represents an area of sea, is superimposed with a rectangular grid. A Base is shown on two of the opposite edges of the board. The area round each base is protected by a harbour wall.&#10;&#10;Each player has a fleet of forty playing pieces. These pieces are rectangles of cardboard which stand upon plastic supports. The two sides are distinguished by the colour on the back of each card, red and blue in this case. The fronts of the cards depict various ships, mines and a flying boat. Each piece has a printed value from 1 for a Patrol Vessel to 10 for the Flagship. These values represent the relative strength of each ship and also indicate the type of ship; battle cruisers, light cruisers, etc.. The ships are also named, H.M.S. Lion, H.M.S. Glasgow and so on. The object of the game is to capture the enemy Flag and transport it back to one's own base while still retaining possession of one's own Flag.&#10;&#10;To start the game, the players place their Flag on their Base and then set up their pieces, one per rectangle, on their own side of the board and with the backs of the cards facing the opponent. In turn the players move a piece one space orthogonally until two opposing pieces are back-to-back. The moving player may then call 'Attack', the two relevant pieces are then revealed and the one with the lower value is sunk and removed from the board.&#10;&#10;In addition to the fighting ships, the players have a number of auxiliary pieces. Mines will automatically blow up virtually all ships that are moved into an attacking position, regardless of whether the owner of the moving ship attacks or not. Once placed, mines may not be moved. Only the mine sweepers can destroy mines. The mine layers act as floating mines. They can be moved but may not attack, but have the same effect upon enemy shipping as a mine. Only the destroyers can sink them. Submarines have a marauding role and can sink all ships except mine layers and MTB's. The good old flying boat has a very important role as it is principally used to capture the enemy flag because it can fly over the harbour walls. Only MTB's and destroyers can shoot it down. When the opposing flag is captured, it is clipped to the top of the capturing piece and thus its whereabouts are known to all. The Flag can be transferred to any other piece standing orthogonally adjacent to the piece which is transporting it.&#10;&#10;It is a fairly straightforward game to play, though tactics can well be employed, particularly in the setting up phase.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    L'Attaque&#10;    Aviation: The Aerial Tactics Game of Attack and Defence&#10;    Tri-Tactics&#10;    Stratego&#10;&#10;&#10;";1919;6.19028;2.1111;2;2;180;12;Nautical, Wargame, World War II;dover patrol harry gibson wonderful naval themed early hide tactic skill sell alongside similar l attaque aviation aerial tactic attack defence complicated call tri tactic incorporation gibson market time series big gibson note l attaque patent france mademoiselle hermance edan u k distribution right acquire gibson dover patrol launch original h p gibson son company register prior international card company operate harry percy gibson purchase icc form company harry gibson open doubt dover patrol like l attaque form basis near identical stratego jumbo publish world war ii patent expire gibson effectively lsquo start rsquo time having premise destroy blitz supposedly represent area sea superimpose rectangular grid base show opposite edge area base protect harbour wall fleet playing piece piece rectangle cardboard stand plastic support side distinguish colour card red blue case front card depict ship mine fly boat piece print value patrol vessel flagship value represent relative strength ship indicate ship battle cruiser light cruiser etc ship name h m lion h m glasgow object capture enemy flag transport base retain possession flag start place flag base set piece rectangle back card face opponent piece space orthogonally oppose piece attack relevant piece reveal low value sink remove addition fighting ship number auxiliary piece mine automatically blow virtually ship attacking position regardless owner ship attack place mine sweeper destroy mine layer act float mine attack effect enemy shipping destroyer sink submarine marauding role sink ship layer mtb good old flying boat important role principally capture enemy flag fly harbour wall mtb destroyer shoot oppose flag capture clip capture piece whereabout know flag transfer piece stand orthogonally adjacent piece transport fairly straightforward tactic employ particularly set similar l attaque aviation aerial tactic attack defence tri tactic stratego
2608;King Oil;"This MB game comes with a plastic &quot;board&quot;.  Its size is dictated by the three randomizing discs embedded in its base, which are used to generate a new playing area every time (there are 1,728 (12^3) different setups possible).&#10;&#10;You buy properties, drill for oil, link properties with pipelines so as to collect royalties and try to be the richest player.  Event cards complicate matters.  Drilling is resolved with a little rig whose plunger is pushed up if it doesn't go through the hidden disc; if it pushes through all three, the well is dry.  Deeper holes cost more, of course.&#10;&#10;Pipelines can be bought once you have 4 producing oil wells on a property; they reach across that property's boundary to another player's property, and are used to siphon royalties from him every turn.  This is a clever mechanic that accelerates bankruptcy and keeps total playing time within reasonable limits.&#10;&#10;Once all players but one are pushed into bankruptcy, the remaining one is the winner.&#10;&#10;";1974;6.10175;1.6585;2;4;60;9;Economic, Industry / Manufacturing;mb come plastic size dictate randomize disc embed base generate new playing area time different possible buy property drill oil link property pipeline collect royalty try rich event card complicate matter drill resolve little rig plunger push doesn t hide disc push dry deep hole cost course pipeline buy produce oil well property reach property boundary property siphon royalty clever accelerate bankruptcy keep total playing time reasonable limit push bankruptcy remain winner

2618;WestwÃ¤rts;"On his last long ride through the wide and wild West, the experienced expedition leader McTrucker realizes that he's getting too old for the job &ndash; but who will take his place? One of the greenhorns accompanying the current expedition?&#10;&#10;To find out which of these greenhorns might be best for the job, McTrucker gives each of them a mission on the final day of the expedition &ndash; and to make sure he finds out how they fare against one another, the missions all bring them into competition with one another. Only the one who can enforce his will best over the others and best deal with unexpected situations will merit being appointed expedition leader.&#10;&#10;To set up Westw&auml;rts, twenty wagon cards &ndash; along with settlers, gold mines and even a scout, barber, preacher, teacher, cook and gravedigger &ndash; are placed beside a munitions wagon. Five cards each are randomly distributed on four area cards (pastureland, desert, Indian country and mountain country). Thirty job cards can be completed, four of which are laid out face-up with a reward of 1-3 gold nuggets for each when completed.&#10;&#10;The progress of the wagon train is controlled by cards, with each player holding three in hand. While game flow is simple, fulfilling demands is not always so. Each player places a movement card face down. The current player reveals his own and that of another. With these two cards, he then resolves the wagon train movements and tries to fulfill jobs. The game ends when a player has earned 15 nuggets or fewer than four incomplete jobs remain. Some jobs are simple with small payoffs while a more difficult one would require, for example, equipping one area with three settlers and two gold diggers or placing the preacher between a settler and a gold digger. In such cases, often the second card is of no help unless players make special arrangements with one another: You scratch my back, I scratch yours. Special cards do things like eliminate or paralyze certain wagons due to fire or broken axles.&#10;&#10;";1995;5.16667;0.0;2;6;60;10;American West, Transportation;long ride wide wild west experienced expedition leader mctrucker realize get old job ndash place greenhorn accompany current expedition find greenhorn good job mctrucker give mission final day expedition ndash sure find fare mission bring competition enforce well good deal unexpected situation merit appoint expedition leader set westw auml rt wagon card ndash settler gold mine scout barber preacher teacher cook gravedigger ndash place munition wagon card randomly distribute area card pastureland desert indian country mountain country thirty job card complete lay face reward gold nugget complete progress wagon train card hold hand flow simple fulfilling demand place card face current reveal card resolve wagon train try fulfill job end earn nugget few incomplete job remain job simple small payoff difficult require example equip area settler gold digger place preacher settler gold digger case second card help special arrangement scratch scratch special card thing like eliminate paralyze certain wagon fire broken axle
2620;Schwimmer in der WÃ¼ste;"In English the title means Swimmers in the Desert which for some will give away the &quot;setting&quot; as that of the novel and film, THE ENGLISH PATIENT.  The situation is that of the beginning of the film.  Players secretly place swimmers on individual boards with the aim of recreating the exact placement of the swimmers on the game board.&#10;&#10;The game is played with 19 small rocks in grey, brown, yellow or white and beautiful handmade materials, and is performed in two parts.  During the first part the stones are placed onto the playing field via auctions.  Two stones at a time are drawn from the bag and auctioned by having each player bidding using one big and one small card.  The small cards have a value from 1 to 3, the big from 1 to 12.  The player with the highest product of the two cards may place both stones onto the board.  The big card is removed from the game, the small card will stay open until the last card of the same type is played.   Only after 3 bidding rounds will you get more small cards in your hand.&#10;&#10;The idea is to place the stones in the right order, which is stated on the card you have hidden from your opponents. You may score a row or column five times during the game even when it isn't your turn. When both color and position match you you place a so-called &quot;2F&quot; or &quot;3F&quot; marker at the row/column which will bring you 2 or 3 points for each correct stone - which can amount to quite a good score in the long 5 stone row. If only the color, but not the position, is correct you use the &quot;2A&quot; or &quot;1A&quot; markers.  One or two points per stone won't get you far, especially in the short 3-stone row, but the most important aspect is not to use the markers too soon.  Firstly, because you cannot score a particular row/column more than once, secondly because you can get your points in the second half of the game.&#10;&#10;When all stones have been placed onto the board the second half of the game beings.  Here you may rearrange the stones. Before the game is over you may you exchange two stones with each other five times.  You shouldn't use your 2- or 3-marker on the short rows/columns, but rather concentrate on the longer. The board has two 5-, four 4- and four 3-rows, and if you don't get the maximum points early in the game will you have to look foolishly on as your opponent places his markers on the two 5- and three of the 4-rows to score maximum points.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.0;0.0;3;4;0;0;Movies / TV / Radio theme;english title mean swimmer desert away set novel film english patient situation beginning film secretly place swimmer individual aim recreate exact swimmer small rock grey brown yellow white beautiful handmade material perform part stone place field auction stone time draw bag auction have bidding big small card small card value big high product card place stone big card remove small card stay open card bidding small card hand idea place stone right order state card hide opponent row column time isn t color position match place call f f marker row column bring correct stone good long stone row color position correct use marker stone t far especially short stone row important aspect use marker soon firstly particular row column secondly second half stone place second half being rearrange stone exchange stone time shouldn t use marker short row column concentrate long row don t maximum early look foolishly opponent place marker row maximum

2630;Die Bombe;"In each round, 2 cards are placed face up. Players then secretly bid on for those cards. The highest bidder can pick one of the two cards to keep. However, that player also receives minus points in the amount of his bid. The player with the second-highest bid gets the remaining card for nothing.&#10;&#10;The cards&#10;There are 6 bombs, 12 red and 12 green value cards. The value cards are worth from 3 ?25 in both colors. The values ascend by twos: 3, 5, 7, 9 ... 25.&#10;&#10;Preparation&#10;Each player receives a paper and a pen. Each player prepares a small table for the minuses on his paper. Leave enough space for bids beside the table.&#10;&#10;The bombs and the value cards are first separated. The value cards are mixed, and 2 are put on the table face up, side by side. The remaining value cards are now shuffled well with the 6 bombs and the stack is placed face down in the middle of the table.&#10;&#10;Play&#10;Each player secretly makes a bid.  All players must bid at least 1. Bids can be no higher than 40. Now all players announce their bids.&#10;&#10;1. The player with the highest number writes it in his deficit table. Now he can select one of the two face-up cards and keeps it in front of him.&#10;&#10;2. The player with the second-highest number takes the remaining face-up card and keeps it in front of him. He does not write in his deficit table.&#10;&#10;Now all players cross out their listed bids. The top two cards of the face-down stack are uncovered and the next round is played in exactly the same manner. Subsequent rounds are played in this way until the stack is completely spent. Then the final scores are announced.&#10;&#10;Each player must display all cards won in plain view, with colors separated. Each individual number must be visible.&#10;&#10;The bombs&#10;When a player takes a bomb, it must be played immediately. The player gives the bomb to a player of his choice covering one of his red or green value cards! The player receiving the bomb must set it and the covered value card aside so that it will score nothing at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;What happens if several players tie for the highest bid?&#10; Only the players who tied for the highest bid continue to bid on the card. Only 1 card is up for bid  and the remaining face-up card is put aside.&#10;&#10;Final score&#10;First the red cards are totaled, then the green in the same manner. Each player adds the values of his red cards. The player with the most red cards doubles the sum of his red cards; all others receive only their normal red-card points. If several players tie for the most red cards, all these players double their red points.&#10;&#10;The points for the red and green cards are added. Minus points are subtracted.

2638;Clash of Giants: Campaigns of Tannenberg and the Marne, 1914;"Clash of Giants contains two separate games (both using the same basic system) covering the two most famous battles of the opening phase of the First World War. Tannenberg was the German victory that halted a Russian offensive into East Prussia and destroyed the Russian 2nd Army. The Marne was the climactic battle of Germany's attempt to defeat France in the war's first six weeks. Arguably a tactical draw, it was a strategic defeat for the Germans as their armies recoiled from the gates of Paris.&#10;&#10;Designed by eight-time Charles S. Roberts award winner Ted S. Raicer (whose most recent game was GMT's Paths of Glory), and developed by Krieg designer Steve Kosakowski, the Clash of Giants system is intended to emphasize playability while still providing players with proper historical feel. The games focus on the difficulty of commanding groups of armies, with a system where movement allowance for each army is separately determined by a command roll.&#10;&#10;Clash of Giants includes the standard and exclusive rules (including rules for Paris Taxis at the Marne and Geman wireless intercepts at Tannenberg), two full size large-hex maps, two player aid cards, and 264 large counters. Units are divisions and brigades.&#10;&#10;Simple but not simplistic, Clash of Giants has a unique combat system based more on a unit's training, equipment, and morale than numbers. In Tannenberg, the victory conditions force both sides to take risks - and the German player will have to use every advantage to avoid being crushed by superior Russian numbers. At the Marne, the Allied player will first have to successfully disengage and rally his French and British armies, before turning to deliver a powerful counterattack. (But don't forget that the Germans can win instantly if they take Paris!)&#10;&#10;The two battles in Clash of Giants [...] are good for solo or competitive play. The Marne (which contains an Allied Counterattack scenario in addition to the full campaign) can be played in an afternoon. Tannenberg can be completed in a couple of hours, making it the perfect game when time is short.&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE:    1-2 days per turn&#10;MAP SCALE:     4.5/3.3 miles per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE:     Divisions and brigades&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS:     One or two&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;&#10;        264 full-color counters&#10;        Two 22&quot;x34&quot; full-color mapsheets&#10;        8-page Rulebook&#10;        12-page Battle Book&#10;        2 Player Aid cards&#10;        One 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;&#10;(from GMT Games website)&#10;&#10;";2001;6.85149;2.2917;2;2;180;12;Wargame, World War I;clash giant contain separate basic cover famous battle opening world war tannenberg german halt russian offensive east prussia destroy russian nd army marne climactic battle germany attempt defeat france war week arguably tactical draw strategic defeat germans army recoil gate paris time charles roberts award winner ted raicer recent gmt path glory develop krieg designer steve kosakowski clash giant intend emphasize playability provide proper historical feel focus difficulty command group army allowance army separately determine command clash giant include standard exclusive include paris taxi marne geman wireless intercept tannenberg size large hex map aid card large unit division brigade simple simplistic clash giant unique combat base unit training equipment morale number tannenberg condition force side risk german use advantage avoid crush superior russian number marne allied successfully disengage rally french british army deliver powerful counterattack don t forget german instantly paris battle clash giant good solo competitive marne contain allied counterattack addition campaign afternoon tannenberg complete couple hour make perfect time short time scale day map scale mile hex unit scale division brigade number component color x color mapsheet page rulebook page battle book aid card side dice gmt website

2642;Frontrunner;"A &quot;humorous&quot; political board game in which players are candidates for the nation's highest office. Players must choose which states to campaign in, how you will spend your $30 Million dollar campaign budget, how to fend off the attacks of opponents, and how to avoid career-ending scandals.

2644;Who Framed Roger Rabbit?;"Based on the movie, this game's object is to discover your opponents' identities, find the Will and return to your home space.&#10;&#10;On your move, you roll two dice (black and white); you move as indicated by the white die (1-6), adding the black die (1-3) if you choose to.  Movement around the board can be accelerated by the Trolley or by Benny the taxi cab (each uses his own special die to move, which boils down to a 1 in 6 chance of stopping --this mechanic pervades the game as you'll see).&#10;&#10;Identities can be guessed by looking at cards set up on the board; each shows half a character's picture, in a player colour.  Once you've seen both halves of a given colour, you're allowed to guess that character as that player's identity.  Each correct guess allows a search for the Will, checking the Confidential cards that lie on the Dip Cannon circle.  Once a player has grabbed the Will, the others go after him and forget about identity-guessing.&#10;&#10;You can steal the Will by Dip Cannonning the Will-holder, by sending a Weasel after him or by landing on him by exact count.  To use th Dip Cannon, you use your (one and only) Dip Cannon card or one of the Judge Doom cards you've previously found, then roll the Dip Cannon die.  Each &quot;Dip&quot; rolled turns the cannon one space towards your target; the &quot;cancel dip&quot; die face stops the process altogether.  If you successfully Dip him, he drops the Will and is sent back to any home space.  Weasels work in similar fashion, the Weasel token starting beside your token and moving towards its quarry with each successful weasel die throw.  Used Weasel cards may be recovered by landing on a special space in the Dip Cannon circle.&#10;&#10;";1987;5.06429;1.5;2;4;60;10;Deduction, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Murder / Mystery;base movie object discover opponent identity find return home space dice black white indicate white die add black die choose accelerate trolley benny taxi cab use special die boil chance stop pervade ll identity guess look card set show half character picture colour ve see half give colour allow guess character identity correct guess allow search check confidential card lie dip cannon circle grab forget identity guess steal dip cannonne holder send weasel land exact count use th dip cannon use dip cannon card judge doom card ve previously find dip cannon die dip cannon space target cancel dip die face stop process altogether successfully dip drop send home space weasel work similar fashion weasel token start token quarry successful weasel die throw weasel card recover land special space dip cannon circle

2652;Wise and Otherwise;"Aptly described as Confucius plays Balderdash.&#10;&#10;One player is designated as the Reader each round. That player reads the first part of an old saying or proverb to the group, and states the country of origin for that proverb. The remaining players must secretly write an ending for the proverb and pass it to the Reader, who collects all possible endings.&#10;&#10;The Reader shuffles the submissions, and then reads each ending aloud for the group.  Players must then vote for the ending they think is authentic. A player gets 2 points for each vote that their submission receives, and an additional 2 points if they vote for the correct ending. If no player votes for the real ending then the Reader is awarded 3 points.&#10;&#10;Once a player has earned 20 points, the game is over. If there is no winner at the end of a round, then the next player becomes the Reader and this process repeats.&#10;&#10;&quot;All the Wit of the World... is Not in One Head&quot;&#10;&#10;With 2500 sayings from across the world, creative wordplay and careful use of dialect are just as important in this game as the metaphors that you create.&#10;&#10;&quot;The Beginning is...

2654;Snap;"The Snap deck consists of 60 cards in 4 color suits. The cards are numbered front and back from 1 to 15. The game is played in two phases. In the &quot;cool phase,&quot; players draw and discard cards in turn order, with the stipulation that the discarded card must be higher in value than the one drawn. This continues until one player is satisfied with the mix achieved in his/her 7-card hand and calls &quot;Snap.&quot; At that point, the &quot;hot phase&quot; begins, with players slapping cards at will - although one at a time - on the discard pile. When two cards with with matching color are placed one over the other, that suit becomes the winning suit. Players then score points for cards of that color in their hand. Players also score for all other cards of any color with numbers matching their winning-suit cards remaining in other players' hands (except for cards valued 10 and above). It is suggested to play as many rounds as players in the game, with the player achieving the most points overall winning.&#10;&#10;";1997;3.44444;0.0;3;5;30;10;Card Game;snap deck consist card color suit card number cool draw discard card order stipulation discard card high value draw continue satisfied mix achieve card hand call snap hot begin slap card time discard pile card matching color place suit suit card color hand card color number match suit card remain hand card value suggest achieve overall

On your turn, you roll up to three dice (1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3), aiming for 4 or less --one die at a time.  If you get 4 or less on two dice, you move twice the amount, if you get it on three, you move thrice.  If you total more than 4, you're busted and your piece goes off board, plus a chip is added to the pot (initially seeded with 1 chip).  As pieces move, they push those in front of them on the track.  There are two exit tracks where you get to push pieces over the side.  Whenever this happens, you also add a chip to the pot.  You can get back on track only if there is a carrier piece available.&#10;&#10;As you pass the pot, you grab the chips there (and seed it again with a chip).

2666;A Mighty Fortress;"Subtitle of the game: &quot;Reformation and Counter-Reformation, 1532-1555&quot;&#10;&#10;On the box cover: &quot;The time is 6 February 1531.&quot;&#10;&#10;One of the games in SPI's Power Politics series.&#10;&#10;From the publisher:&#10;&#10;Recreating the turbulent era of the Reformation, from the viewpoint of political/religious interaction and military activity. A Mighty Fortress is designed with a mechanical simplicity that is matched only by the subtlety of the game's interplay among contesting forces.&#10;&#10;A Mighty Fortress simulates the conditions, which made possible the spread of the Lutheran Reformation and the subsequent Catholic reaction (the Counter-Reformation) in the years 1532-1555. The game recreates the actual historical objectives of the major countries in Europe in the Sixteenth Century as well as their military strengths and resources. There are six players in the game representing the six major countries, England, France, the Ottoman Empire, the Hapsburgs, the Pope, and the collection of German states we will call The Lutherans.&#10;&#10;The Lutheran player is intent on promoting the Protestant cause throughout Europe, and the Papacy is equally resolved to gather any straying nations back into the Catholic fold. The Hapsburg Empire -- strong in arms and sprawling across half the continent -- seeks to maintain its possessions in the face of pressure from all directions. In England, Henry VIII is engaged with his own confrontation with the Pope; and French forces are marshalling to dismantle the Hapsburg dominions. And Suleiman the Magnificent is constantly watching for the opportunity to expand his Ottoman empire -- at anyone's expense.&#10;&#10;The Hapsburgs have, by far, the largest number of combat forces. Unhindered by other problems, they could easily suppress Lutheranism. However, other players have objectives that can usually be achieved only at the expense of the mighty Hapsburgs. Therefore, depending on the rapidly shifting political situation, there will probably be several alliances against Hapsburg influence. Because of this convoluted political situation, the players will often find themselves at cross-purposes with other players whom they were aiding the Game-Turn before. Thus, the possibilities for political and military interaction are extensive.&#10;&#10;A Mighty Fortress covers the twenty-four years from 1532 to 1555 -- a period fraught with shifting alliances, political and religious fervor, and frantic efforts to shift the balance of power. Theological debates, treaties of peace, declarations of war, excommunication, taxation, and missionaries -- all are included in this simulation of one of the most violent and implacably hostile eras of European history. The game covers all actions from the year 1532 -- right after formation of the Schmalkaldic League -- until 1555 and the Peace of Augsburg, which guaranteed Lutheranism as a religion [sic] and allowed the German estates to choose between that and Catholicism.&#10;&#10;Other notes:&#10;&#10;Special rules include those for missionaries, conversion, peace treaties, formal alliances, truces, ultimata, ceding territory, income and borrowing, theological debates, excommunication, Henry VIII's divorce and hidden, variable victory conditions.&#10;Counters = 200&#10;&#10;Other credits:&#10;&#10;Graphic Design: Redmond A.

2667;What Were You Thinking?;"In What Were You Thinking?, the best answer to a question isn&rsquo;t necessarily the correct answer. Instead, players want to come up with the same answer chosen by everybody else--whether it's right or wrong.&#10;&#10;Players take turns asking questions from the question cards. Everyone writes answers to each question, and everyone whose answer agrees with the majority is &ldquo;right.&rdquo; However, other players will be trying to guess what you will answer, so maybe you should give the answer you think is right. If you&rsquo;re not careful you&rsquo;ll find everyone asking, &ldquo;What were you thinking?&rdquo;&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to guess the most common answer (by the current players) to each question.

2673;Hesketh's Legacy;"It is the start of another gray week in metropolis and it&rsquo;s all just been getting you down &hellip; until, that is, a satisfying thud by the front door heralds the arrival of a large brown envelope. Unbeknownst to you, your life is about to change. You curse the postman, as the remains of the shattered letterbox (splinters and all) litter the hall carpet, and a chill Monday-morning breeze whistles through your dressing gown and up the ample trouser of your well-worn pajamas. But this concerns you not, for ripping open the letter reveals a simple house brick with a piece of paper wrapped around it, and a small yellow sticky note attached to the red clay top. The sticky label reads:&#10;&#10;&quot;THROW ME THROUGH YOUR FRONT WINDOW&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Stepping out into the blank a.m. you tut loudly at the myriad gnomes in next door&rsquo;s garden before launching the plain building component, with fullest force, through the ornate Georgian bay window &lsquo;pon abode&rsquo;s frontage.

2697;Spice Navigator;"Each player captains a European merchant ship out to trade for the spices of Africa and Asia.  The board simulates an old map and is divided into four trading regions, each with multiple ports.  Each region sells a different spice and the market price is controlled by card play.  However, an &quot;expert price&quot; can be obtained by guessing the identity of a mystery spice.  The game actually comes with around twenty small containers of real spices that get thrown into a bag.  If a player is trying to get an expert price, he picks one container  at random, opens it, sniffs it, and guesses what it is from a list of common and not so common spices.&#10;&#10;This is not the main aspect of gameplay, but it does spice it up, so to speak.  It is mostly a commodity speculation game; not only do the players need to get good prices on the spices that they are bringing back to Europe, they also need to lay in supplies in order to keep their ship on the move.  Obtaining the money to buy  supplies requires selling spices to regions other than the spice's region of origin; and in this case, a player wants the spice price to be high.&#10;&#10;Event cards add a random aspect to the game and there are pirates prowling the waters who are out to ruin a captain's best laid plans.&#10;&#10;Title translates to &quot;The Spice Route&quot;.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.67705;1.25;2;5;90;8;Economic, Nautical;captain european merchant ship trade spice africa asia simulate old map divide trading region multiple port region sell different spice market price card expert price obtain guess identity mystery spice actually come small container real spice throw bag try expert price pick container random open sniff guess list common common spice main aspect spice speak commodity speculation need good price spice bring europe need lay supply order ship obtain money buy supply require sell spice region spice region origin case want spice price high event card add random aspect pirate prowl water ruin captain well lay plan title translate spice route

A stream of nine cards is placed rising up from a fire;  the narrow smoke cards are always face down, the wide smoke cards are first shown to everyone and then placed face down.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you point to one of the wide smoke cards from spaces 4-9 (not the first three next to the fire) and claim what it is.

2713;James Clavell's Noble House;"From the Publisher:&#10;&#10;Noble House is a game based on the novel by James Clavell. In this game, players take the part of the Tai-Pans of major corporations doing business in Hong Kong in the early 1960's, as portrayed in the Clavell book. Each player is head of a large business conglomerate and is striving to be the most influential and powerful leader in the Hong Kong business community. The route to power lies in the manipulations of the stock market, banks, and holding companies, and other typical corporate skull duggery.&#10;&#10;Synopsis of play:&#10;&#10;During a turn, players draw event cards, which can be used in many ways to affect one's own future, or the future of an opponent. Players then buy and sell stocks on a volatile stock market, which can fluctuate due to purchase and sale of stocks, failed contracts, or even loss of face (bad faith deals). Contracts are then announced, and if a player has sufficient assets, and can maintain those assets, lots of money can be made. Unfulfilled contracts go up for a general bid amongst the players. Players can then attempt to acquire loans from 3 Hong Kong banks, but, if the Bank Directors, or their proxies, so vote, a player can simply be denied a loan. Furthermore, bank directors, in the person of voting cards held by players, can call in outstanding loans, which must be immediately paid. Players now purchase various assets, such as airlines, railroads, shipping lines, industry, land, and human services, which the player must have to fulfill contractual obligations. Players can buy their own assets, or even lease them from other players. All possible wheeling and dealing is allowed, and no one is ever required to keep his or her end of a bargain. Lastly, if a player's stock falls far enough, and they have been unfortunate enough to lose enough of their own &quot;voting&quot; stock, they can be voted out of the game, which will end the game at the end of that phase. Otherwise, the game ends on the turn when the last event card is drawn.&#10;&#10;";1981;6.40217;2.7143;2;5;180;12;Economic, Negotiation, Novel-based;publisher noble house base novel james clavell tai pan major corporation business hong kong early portray clavell book head large business conglomerate strive influential powerful leader hong kong business community route power lie manipulation stock market bank hold company typical corporate skull duggery synopsis draw event card way affect future future opponent buy sell stock volatile stock market fluctuate purchase sale stock fail contract loss face bad faith deal contract announce sufficient asset maintain asset lot money unfulfilled contract general bid attempt acquire loan hong kong bank bank director proxy vote simply deny loan furthermore bank director person voting card hold outstanding loan immediately pay purchase asset airline railroad shipping line industry land human service fulfill contractual obligation buy asset lease possible wheeling dealing allow require end bargain lastly stock fall far unfortunate vote stock vote end end end event card draw

2736;The Lonely Mountain;"Lonely Mountain is an adventure game played by 1 to 6 players. Each player controls a group of adventurers attempting to sneak into the Lonely Mountain (Erebor) and steal as much loot as possible. However, they must escape before Smaug the Dragon awakens, discovers their trespasses, and slays them all. The game takes place relatively soon after Smaug attacked and drove out the Dwarves in Third Age 2770. At that time, Smaug had not yet sealed all of the minor entrances to Erebor, and he considered the entire inner complex of rooms and tunnels to be his &quot;lair&quot;. Thus adventurers can enter (and hopefully leave) in a variety of ways. A raid such as the one this game depicts could have been the event that caused Smaug to close all the minor entrances and to gather most of Erebor&acute;s loot into one huge pile.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a board representing the inner complex of rooms and tunnels where Smaug and most of the &quot;treasure&quot; of the Lonely Mountain reside. The board is highly abstracted and simplified to make play quick and easy. Four of the available groups of adventurers represent the interests of the four major races of Middle-earth: Dwarves, Elves, Men, and Orcs. The &quot;Freebooters&quot; are an independent group of adventurers out for glory and loot. Each group has the same mix of 10 characters: 1 Mage, 1 Animist, 1 Bard, 1 Ranger, 2 Scouts, 2 Archers, and 2 Fighters.&#10;&#10;";1984;6.60762;2.8824;2;5;90;13;Fantasy, Wargame;lonely mountain adventure group adventurer attempt sneak lonely mountain erebor steal loot possible escape smaug dragon awaken discover trespass slay take place relatively soon smaug attack drive dwarf age time smaug seal minor entrance erebor consider entire inner complex room tunnel lair adventurer enter hopefully leave variety way raid depict event cause smaug close minor entrance gather erebor acute loot huge pile represent inner complex room tunnel smaug treasure lonely mountain reside highly abstract simplify quick easy available group adventurer represent interest major race middle earth dwarf elve man orc freebooters independent group adventurer glory loot group mix character mage animist bard ranger scout archer fighter
2738;The Gnumies;"OVERVIEW:&#10;&#10;The Gnumies &amp; their friends from the planet Gnum love big Parties! They like to see Borsis, Dancemites, Boggelors or Divalettis as guests at their parties. But no one wants the dreaded Wullawakis at his party. The Gnummies &amp; their friends are shown on the Gnumies card, &amp; the guests on the party cards. There are 4 of each party card valued from 1 to 10, &amp; one of each party card valued from 11 to 15. The players try to win the most party cards, worth the most points, by playing their Gnumie cards. If a player has 2 or more party cards of the same value, their value multiplies, (2 of kind gets you 20 points, 3 of a kind 50 points and 4 of a kind 100 points). These of course can only be done with the cards that are valued from 1 to 10. A player who wins a Wullawaki, loses points. Having 1 Wullawaki will force you to lose the lowest valued party card that you have. Having 2 Wullawakis will force you to lose the highest valued party card in his party room. With 3 or more Wullawakis, the player will discard as many party cards as he has Wullawakis, (players choice in this case). Of course, the player with the most points at the end of the game is the WINNER!!!&#10;&#10;GAME PLAY:&#10;&#10;1) Any player turns over the top-most card in the party supply stack. &#10;2) Now each player selects a Gnumie card from his hand (Cards have a value from 10 to 100), and places it face-down in front of him (in his Party Room!). When all players have placed their bids face-down on the table, all players then reveal their bids. &#10;3) The player who played the highest valued bid in his party room wins the face-up party card. &#10;4) If 2 or more players tie with the highest bid, the player who has the the most Luckynits (small figures at the bottom of each Gnumie card), wins the party card. &#10;5) The player who wins the party card must discard the Gnumie card that he won with that bid. &#10;6) The other players take back their losing bid party cards. The round is now over and we repeat with Step 1 again.&#10;&#10;7) There is a little twist in the bidding when the Wullawaki card (bad card) comes out. The player with the highest Gnumie card still wins the Wullawaki card, but gets to take back his Gnumie card into his hand and the other players lose their Gnumie cards!&#10;&#10;8) The is also a &quot;WILD CARD&quot; in this game. It is called the &quot;COPICASTOR&quot;. It is a card used to make at least a pair of party cards. The Copicastor takes on the form of the lowest valued party card that the player has in his party room. This insures that a player will have at least a pair of cards and also make the low valued cards somewhat valuable to have, since some people may avoid making a high bid on a low value card. But, if you get this Copicastor it makes that low valued card at least worth 20 points (for a pair).&#10;&#10;9) The game ends when 1 player is left with his Gnumie cards. Since, he can't bid against anybody else, he takes the top most party cards as he has Gnumie cards in his hand.&#10;&#10;10) Scoring is based on attaining pairs, three-of-a-kind &amp; 4-of-a-kind of the numbered party cards that the players bid on (check the Overview paragraph above). If no pairs are attained, the value of that card is scored. So, if you have two 5-point cards, you score 20 Points for having a pair. But, if you have only one 5-point card you score 5 points!&#10;&#10;10) The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!!!&#10;&#10;Ages 8 and up&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Asterix: Das Kartenspiel&#10;&#10;&#10;";2001;5.34324;1.1667;2;5;20;8;Card Game, Fantasy;overview gnumie amp friend planet gnum love big party like borsis dancemite boggelor divalettis guest party want dread wullawaki party gnummie amp friend show gnumie card amp guest party card party card value amp party card value try party card worth gnumie card party card value value multiplie kind get kind kind course card value wullawaki have wullawaki force low value party card have wullawaki force high value party card party room wullawaki discard party card wullawakis case course end winner card party supply select gnumie card hand card value place face party room place bid face table reveal bid high value bid party room face party card tie high bid luckynit small figure gnumie card party card party card discard gnumie card bid bid party card repeat step little twist bidding wullawaki card bad card come high gnumie card wullawaki card get gnumie card hand gnumie card wild card call copicastor card pair party card copicastor take form low value party card party room insure pair card low value card somewhat valuable people avoid make high bid low value card copicastor make low value card worth pair end leave gnumie card t bid anybody take party card gnumie card hand base attain pair kind amp kind numbered party card bid check overview paragraph pair attain value card card have pair card end age implement asterix das kartenspiel

2742;Wings: World War One Plane to Plane Combat 1916-1918;"&quot;A game of plane to plane combat in World War I&quot;&#10;&#10;There is plenty of goodies in the box, including three geomorphic map boards, plenty of thick counters, and as much rules as you can stomach. Luckily, you can select both your level of realism (i.e. complexity: ranging from the Mass Game to the Duel Game) and the length of the scenario (30 min to 4 hours), so the game is pretty flexible in this regard.&#10;&#10;(what follows is abstracted from the ZOCO Historical Simulations Archive review)&#10;&#10;Wings is a simultaneous movement job and can get pretty complex. This is traditional heavy duty boardgaming, not as complex as Advanced Squad Leader but harder than Wooden Ships &amp; Iron Men and only workable with very few planes per player. Thankfully the rules do not all have to be used and Wings works pretty well with basic rules, with some of the advanced and optionals as required. The advanced rules are supposed to be used as a block but consist largely of tricky maneuvers as opposed to the turns and slides of the basic rules. A simpler fleet-style game using plenty of planes is also provided. The scenarios provided include the legendary Wings 6 hex Zeppelin counter, boat targets, bombing, trench-strafing and photo runs.&#10;&#10;The basic problem of WWI air combat as presented in Wings is that the planes are not very good, not very fast, grossly underpowered, turn poorly and chances are that when they get a shot off they tend to miss. As a result, there is a lot of manoeuvring (more than the columns provided on the plotting pad) and relatively little damage (it could have been jotted down separately instead of occupying part of the pad). 3-D is simulated through altitude levels (0 to the 800s --although many planes will not get that high); planes go faster when diving and lose speed when climbing. Go too slow and you will stall and spin downwards until you can pick up enough speed or crash.&#10;&#10;Simultaneous movement games often involve a lot of ESP because it is hard to tell where the opposition is going. Things are not so bad in Wings because planes have bank attitudes showing which way they lean, like in Blue Max. Turning, manoeuvring and climbing restrictions are such that you can narrow down the other plane's intent by carefully paying attention to its banking attitude. Likewise, firing arcs are restricted, and the penalties for firing in a turn and the like are pretty steep, so naturally a plane that thinks it has a good shot will keep pretty straight and level, not too hard to out-manoeuvre. The general problem of planes chasing each other over an endless sky and having limited powers of turning and climbing means they will not often be in each other's guns. Having missed, it will take some time for the planes to all move around back into suitable combat positions. The game is considerably improved by having more than 1 plane on each side, thus ameliorating the chance of someone being able to fire at someone else.&#10;&#10;Gunnery is based on 2D6 rolled as 11 to 66 (a frequent mechanism in Yaquinto games). Results will rarely destroy a target on 1 hit but affect some part of the plane. When not hitting Structure, your hits will likely reduce the limited performance of the planes. Some hits can reduce the power rating of planes. If the target only has 1&#10;power to spend each turn and it loses that, then it is in trouble --it can no longer climb or turn without losing speed and will be forced to dive to get anywhere. It is thus more sensible to fly off when suitably blooded rather than prolonging the game as planes slowly drag themselves back into combat.&#10;&#10;Solitaire gaming works quite well because the rules severely limit what a plane can do so the guessing is kept low. Play actually improves with more players as this generates more opportunities for mayhem. 50 plane types are provided although Yaquinto never published Wings II so other planes are referred to in the force tables that have no details (although it just may be possible to figure out those &quot;missing&quot; planes' characteristics from their counterparts in Blue Max and Knights of the Air). The planes are rated differently, but unfortunately performance varies with altitude so you need to check the plane reference card frequently --whilst the gun data is on the opposite side of the card.&#10;&#10;";1981;7.15211;3.2857;1;4;120;0;Aviation / Flight, Wargame, World War I;plane plane combat world war plenty goody box include geomorphic map plenty thick stomach luckily select realism e complexity range mass duel length min hour pretty flexible regard follow abstract zoco historical simulation archive review wing simultaneous job pretty complex traditional heavy duty boardgaming complex advanced squad leader hard wooden ship amp iron man workable plane thankfully wing work pretty basic advanced optional require advanced suppose block consist largely tricky maneuver oppose slide basic simple fleet style plenty plane provide provide include legendary wing hex zeppelin boat target bombing trench strafing photo run basic problem wwi air combat present wing plane good fast grossly underpowered poorly chance shot tend miss result lot manoeuvre column provide plotting pad relatively little damage jot separately instead occupy pad d simulate altitude plane high plane fast diving speed climbing slow stall spin downward pick speed crash simultaneous involve lot esp hard tell opposition go thing bad wing plane bank attitude show way lean like blue max turning manoeuvring climbing restriction narrow plane intent carefully pay attention banking attitude likewise fire arc restrict penalty fire like pretty steep naturally plane think good shot pretty straight hard manoeuvre general problem plane chase endless sky have limited power climbing mean gun having miss time plane suitable combat position considerably improve have plane ameliorate chance able fire gunnery base d frequent mechanism yaquinto result rarely destroy target hit affect plane hit structure hit likely reduce limited performance plane hit reduce power rating plane target power spend trouble long climb speed force dive sensible fly suitably blood prolong plane slowly drag combat solitaire gaming work severely limit plane guessing keep low actually improve generate opportunity mayhem plane provide yaquinto publish wing ii plane refer force table detail possible figure miss plane characteristic counterpart blue max knight air plane rate differently unfortunately performance vary altitude need check plane reference card frequently whilst gun data opposite card

2748;Thirty Years War: Europe in Agony, 1618-1648;"(from GMT website:)&#10;&#10;Central Europe, 1618. Germany is a jigsaw puzzle of independent Electorates, Bishoprics, Dukedoms, and Imperial Free Cities nominally under the control of the Holy Roman Emperor in Vienna. An alliance of Protestant leaders rebel against the Emperor, who raises armies to suppress them and regain Catholic property lost during the Reformation; the surrounding kings of Spain, France, Sweden, and Denmark intervene to stake their own claims. Germany is plunged into thirty years of war that will last until 1648, when the exhausted combatants sign a peace establishing the competing spheres of interest that will control Germany for the next two centuries.&#10;&#10;&quot;Thirty Years War&quot; recreates this conflict with the award winning wargame system used in GMT's Wilderness War, Paths of Glory, and For the People. There are four scenarios provided: the Full Campaign (14 turns), Early War (5 turns), Intervention (3 turns), and Apocalypse (5 turns).&#10;&#10;This is a two-player wargame; one controls the Protestant forces (German Protestants, Sweden, Denmark, Hungary, France) while the other runs Catholics (the Empire, Bavaria, Spain, and occasionally Saxony, which can switch sides during play!). The heart of the game is the playing card decks of 55 cards that each player receives. Playing a card gives a player the option to move and attack with an army, to recruit new units, to bank up money to pay ever-hungry troops, or to declare an event.&#10;&#10;The Peace of Westphalia made certain that Germany would remain divided for another two centuries. Can the Catholic player defy history by recreating the power of the old Holy Roman Empire? Does Gustavus Adolphus survive to dictate peace to the Emperor in Vienna? Thirty Years War allows the players to determine these and other historical what-ifs, while opening a window onto one of the most influential events in European history.&#10;&#10;COUNTERS: 456 full-color die-cut counters.&#10;MAP: One 22&quot;x34&quot; full-color mapsheet&#10;CARDS: 110 Strategy cards&#10;OTHER: Two 10-sided dice, 32-page Rulebook, 2 Player Aid cards&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE: 2 years per turn&#10;MAP SCALE: Point-to-point system&#10;UNIT SCALE: 3-5,000 men each&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS: One or two&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: David Fox&#10;DEVELOPER: Michael Welker&#10;ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

Your armies have to be paid, with Aid Points that are received just like Paths of Glory's RPs. An interesting twist is that the movement and support of armies results in the landscape getting Pillaged, so as the game goes on the board becomes less and less capable of supporting military operations.&#10;&#10;";2001;6.87804;3.1607;1;2;360;14;Pike and Shot, Wargame;gmt website central europe germany jigsaw puzzle independent electorate bishopric dukedom imperial free city nominally holy roman emperor vienna alliance protestant leader rebel emperor raise army suppress regain catholic property reformation surround king spain france sweden denmark intervene stake claim germany plunge thirty year war exhausted combatant sign peace establish compete sphere interest germany century thirty year war recreate conflict award wargame gmt wilderness war path glory people provide campaign early war intervention apocalypse wargame protestant force german protestant sweden denmark hungary france run catholic empire bavaria spain occasionally saxony switch side heart playing card deck card receive card give option attack army recruit new unit bank money pay hungry troop declare event peace westphalia certain germany remain divided century catholic defy history recreate power old holy roman empire gustavus adolphus survive dictate peace emperor vienna thirty year war allow determine historical if open window influential event european history color die cut map x color mapsheet card strategy card sided dice page rulebook aid card time scale year map scale unit scale man number designer david fox developer michael welk art director rodger b macgowan map amp card art mark simonitch art mark simonitch rodger b macgowan bgg user description direct descendant path glory year war cover confusing post reformation conflict central europe holy roman empire attempt reassert domination protestant state catholicism holy roman empire austria northern italy spain oppose cast thousand german protestant sweden height power france england denmark new virtually entire borrow leader activation hannibal combat straight path glory minus flanking siege resolve hannibal army pay aid receive like path glory rps interesting twist support army result landscape getting pillage go capable support military operation

2752;Combat Cards;"&quot;An abstract game of military strategy set in World War II&quot;&#10;&#10;This card game is played in partnerships by two, four or six people.  Each team represents the combined resources of a bloc of nations at war with the other team.  Points are accumulated by conducting offensives, opening new fronts and successfully countering enemy offensives.  The game ends once all the cards have been drawn and played.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you may shift a combat card between two of your fronts before drawing and playing or discarding a card.  Fronts are prepared face down, until the offensive is declared.  Fronts are laid out like in Caesar &amp; Cleopatra (or Hera &amp; Zeus --those kinds of games).  Cards come in two types, combat and &quot;special&quot;.  The combat cards represent units of infantry, armor, mine fields and so on.  Special cards include Strategic Bombing (which permanently reduces a player's hand size), New Front, Offensive/Supply (which launches or sustains an offensive, or can be used to shift Airborne combat cards between fronts).&#10;&#10;Points are scored mostly during offensives; every turn an offensive goes on, the difference between the attacker's total offense and the defender's total defense is scored by the stronger side.  There is also a bonus point score when opening a new front.&#10;&#10;The cards are very bland looking with a simple APP-6 or SPI-style symbol, a pair of offense/defense ratings and some explanatory text.  Most combat units lack character: Armour, Infantry and Combat Engineers work nearly the same way except for their different offense/defense ratings.  I'd have given the Combat Engineers a special power against Mine Fields, for example.&#10;&#10;";1984;4.0;1.0;2;6;90;12;Card Game, Wargame, World War II;abstract military strategy set world war ii card partnership people team represent combined resource bloc nation war team accumulate conduct offensive open new front successfully enemy offensive end card draw shift combat card front draw discard card front prepared face offensive declare front lay like caesar amp cleopatra hera amp zeus kind card come combat special combat card represent unit infantry armor field special card include strategic bombing permanently reduce hand size new offensive supply launch sustain offensive shift airborne combat card front offensive offensive go difference attacker total offense defender total defense strong bonus open new card bland look simple app spi style symbol pair offense defense rating explanatory text combat unit lack character armour infantry combat engineer work nearly way different offense defense rating d give combat engineer special power field example

This does end your turn.)&#10;&#10;Every time you play a pair you skip the next player in turn.  If you play 2 pairs you skip the next two players, etc.  You can never skip yourself so in a 3-player game if you play 3 pairs, then end your turn by drawing or playing a single card, you then take another turn.&#10;&#10;When playing a pair you may place them in any order.

The deck consists of 4 suits (usually clubs, spades, hearts, diamonds), and a permanent trump suit (Tarock) of 22 cards.&#10;&#10;There are variants of tarock for 2 to 5 players.&#10;&#10;Straw man tarock is a variant for 2 players where each players hand is augmented by cards dealt out into piles in front of him/her at the beginning of the game.&#10;&#10;Tapp tarock is a variant for 3 players that does away with the bid to 'call a king'.&#10;&#10;K&ouml;nigrufen is a variant for 4 active players (with 5 one player deals and sits out that round) who are dealt 12 cards and 6 for the talon, bidding indicates how many cards will be used from the talon with the remaining cards being split by the other players. The declarer calls a trump (XIX) or one of the kings to indicate a partner (the partner does not indicate this fact though), after which players can make bonus announcements and doublings. During the play, suit must be followed and trump must be played if you are out of the suit. Points are counted after each round and the declarer, generally, needs to take more than half in order to fulfill the contract.&#10;&#10;";1425;7.35707;3.55;2;5;30;0;Card Game;tarock general term trick taking central europe use card tarock deck common bidding follow announcement indicate bonus attempt doubling announce bonus deck consist suit usually club spade heart diamond permanent trump suit tarock card tarock straw man tarock hand augment card deal pile beginning tapp tarock away bid king k ouml nigrufen active deal sit deal card talon bidding indicate card talon remain card split declarer call trump xix king indicate partner partner indicate fact bonus announcement doubling suit follow trump suit count declarer generally need half order fulfill contract
2782;Vantage;"There are 106 cards: 5 suits (red, yellow, green, blue, purple) of 1-14, four Wild cards and 28 Action cards (Cards Up, Black Out, Pass One, Lose One). Each suit contains one special &quot;BIG&quot; card used in scoring (Red 10, Yellow 6, Green 7, Blue 12, Purple 2). Initial deal is four, Action cards in a separate stack.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you turn over an Action card and follow its instructions. You then match, build or discard one card from your hand. Cards Up turns all cards on the table face up, Black Out face down. Pass One means everyone passes a card to one's right. Lose One means you put a card down face up.&#10;&#10;Matching concerns the card values; you can collect cards of the same value as the played card, or pairs of cards that add up to that value. Building means you match as above but leave the matched cards as a pile, vulnerable to another player's matching. This is usually done so you can collect another card from your own hand (so you would &quot;Build eights&quot; with the table's 5+3 and your 8, hoping to &quot;Match eights&quot; on your next turn with your other 8). Discarding is what you do if you cannot Match or Build. This increases the table's pool of cards open for matching or building.&#10;&#10;After you've played your 4 cards in this way, another round ensues, and so forth until the entire deck has been gone through. Scoring is +10 for the most cards collected, +8 for the most Purple cards collected, +6 for the most Red cards collected, +4 for each &quot;BIG&quot; card collected, +2 for each 1 card, +2 for each Wild card.&#10;&#10;During a Black Out, you must memorize which card is which; if you declare a play but get the cards wrong, your played card is simply added to those already face down on the table.&#10;&#10;";1985;4.45238;1.3333;2;4;30;9;Card Game, Memory;card suit red yellow green blue purple wild card action card card black pass suit contain special big card red yellow green blue purple initial deal action card separate action card follow instruction match build discard card hand card card table face black face pass mean pass card right mean card face match concern card value collect card value card pair card add value building mean match leave match card pile vulnerable match usually collect card hand build eight table hope match eight discarding match build increase table pool card open match building ve card way ensue forth entire deck go card collect purple card collect red card collect big card collect card wild card black memorize card declare card wrong card simply add face table
2784;Plague!;"The Black Death was no Weekend Special. A lot of people became poorly, very poorly indeed. In fact, so poorly they had to be taken away because their Immortality was wearing rather thin.&#10;And... as Fate would have it they died right on time, left, right and center. The best place for these unfortunate victims was somewhere deep, dark and damp. Not too much unlike a pit (and people were dying to get there).&#10;&#10;Plague! Is a germ-free board game, we hope, for those of you who dare to transport wagon loads of infected victims to their final resting place, a deep pit at Clarks Hill. &#10; Object: Inspired by the yodel 'Bring out your Dead' the object of the game, for those who wish to play, is for each player to control a wagon which is used to visit the houses. Plague victims are 'claimed' and taken away to a burial site. All this whilst avoiding rats and fleas. The first to 'bury' 99 victims wins (remember, you're only doing your job).

2792;Coco Crazy;"Six coconuts each contain six monkeys (&quot;bobbles&quot;) of identical colour.  Each player is trying to collect one bobble of each colour (five when playing with 7 or 8 players).  The game starts with the coconuts mixed on the board so that no one knows which one contains which colour.  Then each player peeks at one coconut.  On your turn, you roll a die.  Results possible include turning the board 90 degrees, guessing at a coconut's bobbles' colour (that's how you get bobbles) and having each player swap two coconuts as quickly as possible.&#10;&#10;A very merry game!&#10;&#10;Awards&#10;&#10;1992 &#195;&#133;rets Familiespil, Family Game of the Year Denmark&#10;&#10;";1992;5.4536;1.1304;2;8;20;7;Animals, Children's Game, Memory, Party Game;coconut contain monkey bobble identical colour try collect bobble colour start coconut mix know contain colour peek coconut die result possible include degree guess coconut bobble colour bobble have swap coconut quickly possible merry awards ret familiespil family year denmark
2794;Spinball;"Try to maneuver the ping-pong ball into your opponents goal by deftly applying just enough backspin and English to reflect off the sidewalls and around the barrier that separates you.  You have 5 attempts to get a goal, as long as the ball keeps returning to you.  But if you put too much speed on it, it'll fly off the other side as there's no backstop in this game, only side rails.  If you can manage to curl it all the way into your opponents 'end zone' and make it come back into the goal, you get two points.  But instead of taking a point, you can set up a blocker instead, to try to protect your goal.  Comes with each players yoke like ball holder and rubber shooting implement with a small wooden handle.

2796;Quickely Dice;"Quik E Ly Dice is part dice game, part card collecting and melding game.&#10;A single set consists of 8 dice in 2 colours and 54 cards, 27 of in each of the same two colours as the dice.&#10;One set is suitable for two players, and there are three sets in all; Using all three with half the 162 cards allows up to six players.&#10;The cards depict two dice faces, one above the other. The object is to score points by collecting and then melding the cards, a la rummy.&#10;Players may meld numerical sequences of up to 11 cards, scoring 1 point for each card in the meld. These sequences must be along the top row dice face of the cards. Bonus points are scored for also forming certain combinations along the bottom row. For example, a sequence showing Red 1/4, 2/5, 3/6, 4/6 would score 16 points; 4 points for the 1,2,3,4 sequence along the top row, multiplied by 2 for all the cards being the same color, multiplied by 2 again for the 4,5,6 sequence along the bottom. There are several other bonuses which may be scored. &#10;The mechanics of the game are very simple. Several cards will be face up on the table at any one time. Each player may roll up to 3 of their 4 dice in an attempt to capture 1 or more of these cards.&#10;Cards are captured by rolling the two numbers corresponding to the two dice on a card. Thus, rolling a 1, 4, 5 will allow you to capture a 5/1, a 4/1 or a 5/4 card, provided they are available.&#10;If a player rolls just one of the numbers on a card that he/she wants, that player may &quot;reserve&quot; that card by placing the single dice on the card. If the player subsequently rolls the second number in a later turn, he/she can take the card. Reserved cards may still be captured by other players.&#10;";2001;4.0;2.0;2;6;60;0;Card Game, Dice;quik e ly dice dice card collect meld single set consist dice colour card colour dice set suitable set half card allow card depict dice face object collect meld card la rummy meld numerical sequence card card meld sequence row dice face card bonus form certain combination row example sequence show red sequence row multiply card color multiply sequence bonus simple card face table time dice attempt capture card card capture number correspond dice card allow capture card provide available number card want reserve card place single dice card subsequently second number later card reserve card capture
2798;The Ironclads: Expansion Kit;"The Expansion Kit extends the The Ironclads: A Tactical Level Game of Naval Combat in the American Civil War 1861-1865 system to 1879, adds ships from major European powers of the same time period, and features some optional rules (e.g., land and land-sea action, designated targets, double/triple gun loads, sharpshooters). New scenarios also, many of them set in the American Civil War, but some in South America or Europe.&#10;&#10;Originally issued by Yaquinto Games, a 2nd edition was released by Excalibre Games and this 2nd edition makes a number of corrections as well as features improved physical quality and graphics.&#10;&#10;The box-cover image shown above is the Yaquinto version.

2800;The Ironclads: A Tactical Level Game of Naval Combat in the American Civil War 1861-1865;"(from a Yaquinto ad:)&#10;&#10;The IRONCLADS is a tactical level, simultaneous movement, game of ship-to-ship combat in the American Civil War. Players move one or more of over 130 counters that represent individual ships over a large (42&quot; x 27-1/2&quot;) four pieceqeomorphlc mapboard as they attempt to outmaneuver and out-shoot their opponents. 45 ship specification cards give such vital information as the number, size, location and play of individual guns that are fired separately using specific range and penetration tables for each weapon. The ship specification card also contains target information for such areas as; armor, siding, decking, smoke stack, hull, pilot house, waterline, crew and gun hits. Other unit counters include five individual forts, floating batteries, mines, torpedos, booms, piles, heavy obstructions, fires, damaged ships, sunk ships, mortar rafts and much more.&#10;&#10;'The IRONCLADS comes boxed and complete with over 300 extra&shy; thick, die cut unit counters, the large mapboard, a well organized log pad, a set of charts and tables, range and play indicators for firing, two game dice, a plastic tray for unit separation and storage, 45 ship specification cards that represent 90 classes of ships and a rule book that covers such items as river currents, tides, forts, mines, armor penetra tion, crew quality and morale, smoke and sighting, sand bars, shoals and river banks, burning ships and fire fighting, different types of shot, cumulative damage in specific areas, critical hits and much, much more.

2802;War in Europe;"War in Europe is a compendium of three modules, War in the East 2nd ed., War in the West, and War in Europe. The two base games, War in the East 2nd ed. and War in the West, are both playable individually and are both designed for two sided play. War in Europe provides an integrated linkage between these two and provides for three player play.&#10;&#10;The game system traces its lineage from SPI's earlier Kursk and Destruction of Army Group Centre but was primarily inspired by War in the  East 1st. ed.  War in Europe is played on nine full sized (22&quot;x34&quot;) coloured  maps and employs about 3600 1/2x1/2&quot; cardboard pieces.&#10;&#10;The three sides in the full game are the Italo-German Axis, the Anglo- French-American Allies, and the Soviet Union. Political rules govern the  alignment of neutral states and restrict the use of active minor power units  by the controlling players. Rules also restrict the degree of co-operation between units of differing nationalities, whether Axis or Allied. The victory  conditions are also constructed to limit the degree of co-operation between  independent Allied and Soviet players.&#10;&#10;Each 3/4&quot; hex represents 20 miles. A single game-turn consists of three sequential player turns and represents one week elapsed time. Four game- turns form a 'cycle' at the beginning of which strategic warfare and economic production takes place. Thirteen cycles form a game year. Both Axis and Soviet power produce additional forces via a simplified economic  production process. Allied forces are received only by a preset reinforcement schedule.&#10;&#10;Player pieces called units represent division and brigade sized military formations. In addition to units, all powers also possess air-point counters representing abstract air power at an estimated scale of 500 sorties per point. Markers are a third category of playing piece used to note some temporary alteration to the map or to a unit.&#10;&#10;Allied and Axis powers have amphibious point counters representing invasion lift assets. Each amphibious point is capable of lifting a single divisional sized unit and as acting as a 'beachhead' supply source. The Axis powers also have counters for Naval Transport points and Naval Surface Combat points. The Axis may build these points via his production routines.&#10;&#10;Naval points (of all types) risk interception and elimination (along with any transported unit) by air power when used to transport land units, enable  supply, or provide escort. Axis naval points also risk Allied naval interception and elimination when conducting transport operations on the high seas (anywhere other than the Baltic). The Allied player has a  standard number of naval transport points (15) that does not change from turn to turn and which cannot be destroyed when intercepted, though their cargo may be. Expended (not destroyed) amphibious points are automatically returned to play after a nine turn delay.&#10;&#10;The Soviet power possesses one transport point in the Baltic so long as Leningrad remains uncaptured and one naval transport point in the Black Sea so long as the Soviet retains at least one Black Sea port. If the Soviets ever lose their naval transport capability in either sea then it is lost for the rest of the game and cannot be restored.&#10;&#10;The Axis power possesses counters for sub points and markers for land fortifications (the Atlantic Wall). Both of these must be produced using the economic system employed during the strategic inter-phase conducted at the start of each cycle. Sub points are used to determine the rate of Allied reinforcement and are themselves subject to loss.&#10;&#10;The Allied power receives Strategic Bomber Points which are used to disable Axis Production and Transportation during the Strategic Inter- phase. These are subject to loss by German Strategic Air Defence air- points and Flak Points.&#10;&#10;A number of scenarios are provided covering the entire war or significant campaigns. Victory is determined by the Axis political point total and the possession of specified hexes. The Axis political point total is adjusted during the game based on Allied and Axis actions together with the control of specific hexes or the conquest/occupation/liberation of nations. A novel feature in the design is the use of varying CRTs by nation/year to account for the changing relationships in the combat power of units over the course of a six year war without recourse to replacement counters for the units.&#10;&#10;The original game was issued in SPI notorious 'flat-pack' plastic tray packaging that required three units to contain the product. Later (1978?) War in Europe was retailed in the large bookcase box format (the Soap- box). The game was ported to a MS-DOS computer program published by  Decision Games in 1996 and a revised reprint of the original boardgame was published by Decision Games in 1999. A New PC version of war in Europe will allow players to battle one another PBEM or face to face and is currently under development.&#10;&#10;The game contains: &#10;- 3600 counters&#10;&#10;        (Three identical Axis 400 counter contersheets)&#10;        (Three identical Russian 400 counter contersheets)&#10;        (Three identical Western Allied 400 counter contersheets)&#10;&#10;&#10;- Nine maps (A-H,J)&#10;- Four Rulebooks&#10;&#10;        (Standard Rules)&#10;        (War in the East 2nd Edition Exclusive Rules)&#10;        (War in the West Exclusive Rules)&#10;        (War in Europe Exclusive Rules)&#10;&#10;&#10;- Axis Production Spiral&#10;- Soviet Production Spiral&#10;- Axis Game-Turn Cycle Record Track&#10;- Soviet Game-Turn Cycle Record Track &#10;- Allied Game-Turn Cycle Record Track&#10;- Two Identical War in the East Comvbat Results Tables&#10;- Two Identical War in the West Comvbat Results Tables&#10;&#10;";1976;7.21583;3.9231;2;3;360;14;Economic, Political, Wargame, World War II;war europe compendium module war east nd ed war west war europe base war east nd ed war west playable individually sided war europe provide integrate linkage provide trace lineage spi early kursk destruction army group centre primarily inspire war east st ed war europe sized x colour map employ x cardboard piece side italo german axis anglo french american ally soviet union political govern alignment neutral state restrict use active minor power unit restrict degree co operation unit differ nationality axis ally condition construct limit degree co operation independent allied soviet hex represent mile single consist sequential represents week elapse time form cycle beginning strategic warfare economic production take place thirteen cycle form year axis soviet power produce additional force simplified economic production process ally force receive preset reinforcement schedule piece call unit represent division brigade size military formation addition unit power possess air represent abstract air power estimate scale sortie marker category piece note temporary alteration map unit ally axis power amphibious represent invasion lift asset amphibious capable lift single divisional sized unit act beachhead supply source axis power naval transport naval surface combat axis build production routine naval risk interception elimination transport unit air power transport land unit enable supply provide escort axis naval risk ally naval interception elimination conduct transport operation high sea baltic allied standard number naval transport change destroy intercept cargo expend destroy amphibious automatically return delay soviet power possess transport baltic long leningrad remain uncaptured naval transport black sea long soviet retain black sea port soviet naval transport capability sea rest restore axis power possess sub marker land fortification atlantic wall produce economic employ strategic inter conduct start cycle sub determine rate ally reinforcement subject loss ally power receive strategic bomber disable axis production transportation strategic inter subject loss german strategic air defence air flak number provide cover entire war significant campaign determine axis political total possession specified hex axis political total adjust base allied axis action specific hex conquest occupation liberation nation novel use vary crt nation year account change relationship combat power unit course year war recourse replacement unit original issue spi notorious flat pack plastic tray packaging require unit contain product late war europe retail large bookcase box format soap box port ms do computer program publish decision revise reprint original boardgame publish decision new pc war europe allow battle pbem face face currently development contain identical axis contersheet identical russian contersheet identical western ally contersheet map h j rulebook standard war east nd exclusive war west exclusive war europe exclusive axis production spiral soviet production spiral axis cycle record track soviet cycle record track ally cycle record track identical war east comvbat result table identical war west comvbat result table

Twenty-four &quot;spokes&quot; combine with them to form a grid. Players each have a wooden balloon which shows its altitude by stacking it up, insecurely it seems, on small wooden disks. They also receive at start four ascent cards and four descent (gas bottle) cards. A wooden arrow on a disk at the center shows the current wind direction.&#10;&#10;Players move by rolling two dice, a special one which describes a change in wind direction or a requirement on the player and an ordinary one which gives the amount to move. There are actually three games in one, all centered around getting a balloon to a specific location, the first two based on real life balloonist games: a chase or &quot;fox hunt&quot; and a target race. The third scenario describes a race to the center of the board.&#10;&#10;";1983;5.91667;0.0;4;6;45;8;Aviation / Flight, Dice, Racing;year hot air balloon commemorate bicentennial balloon ascent montgolfier brother circular divide concentric ring spoke combine form grid wooden balloon show altitude insecurely small wooden disk receive start ascent card descent gas bottle card wooden arrow disk center show current wind direction dice special describe change wind direction requirement ordinary give actually center get balloon specific location base real life balloonist chase fox hunt target race describe race center

2808;The Russian Campaign;"On the 18th of December, 1940 Hitler issued Fuhrer Directive No. 21, code named Barbarossa, which stated: &ldquo;The Soviet Union is to be crushed in one swift campaign before the war with England ends.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;On the 22nd of June, 1941, Barbarossa was finally launched. Over three million German soldiers, most of them veterans of the campaigns in Poland, France, and the Balkans, began a blitzkrieg style of invasion against two million Russian defenders. The initial advance was fantastic. Hundreds of thousands of prisoners were taken and the motorized divisions began to outrun the rest of the army. The Germans reached the gates of Moscow, victory in sight. Then the winter came.&#10;&#10;RUSSIAN CAMPAIGN has been universally acclaimed as one of the finest wargames around. With the ease and playability of the 'Classics', the game also conveys the feel of the actual campaign and is exceptionally accurate historically. Both players will have to use the subtle skills, advantages, and tactics of their historical counterparts to win.&#10;&#10;Game features include rail movement, sea movement, invasions, stukas, partisans, automatic victory, SS units, sudden death victory conditions, and double impulse movement capabilities. Seven scenarios break the total campaign down into its most important battles.&#10;A 22&quot; x 28&quot; mapboard, various playing aids and charts, and a twelve-page rulebook.

2810;Checkpoint: Danger!;"This is a distant relative of Battleship.  Each player deploys four agents over a world map.  Then, using probes you try to deduce the position of the enemy agents before he deduces the positions of yours.  Basically, when you probe a grid location, the opponent announces how many of his agents can be reached in a straight line (including diagonals) from the probed location --excluding any of his agents which may be hidden behind others.&#10;&#10;Some extra complications occur because both are playing on the same map: for example, you may not probe where the opponent has probed, which opens up strategic opportunities...  &quot;Checkpoint: Danger!&quot; is what you call out when you're convinced one of his agents is in the same location as one of yours.&#10;&#10;";1978;6.33929;1.3333;2;2;30;10;Deduction, Spies / Secret Agents;distant relative battleship deploy agent world map probe try deduce position enemy agent deduce position basically probe grid location opponent announce agent reach straight line include diagonal probed location exclude agent hide extra complication occur map example probe opponent probe open strategic opportunity checkpoint danger convince agent location
2812;Platoon;"Platoon is a simple wargame on small squad combat in Vietnam.  The game is similar to AH's Smithsonian series games:  a single sheet with basic rules and a small booklet that contains advanced rules, additional scenarios and historical background information.  The combat system is also similar to other Smithsonian games.&#10;&#10;The scenarios and soldiers are based upon events and characters in the movie.&#10;&#10;The game uses two elements to create fog of war:&#10;-  the counters have small stands so the identity of each counter is unknown to the enemy.

2814;Rapid Recall;"A player on one team gives clues to the rest of their team (possibly only 1 player) from a card that contains 10 words or phrases.  If the player knows what the clue is, they throw a chip in a bin on the game board.  Once the time is up, the 10 words have been clued, or the player elects to stop, they begin recalling the words that were clued from memory.  Upon getting the word correct (with one guess at each one only), a chip is taken out of the bin and put down on the guesser's side of the board.  If the clue is missed or if it is forgotten, the chip stays in the bin.  Once the guessing is completed or the time runs out, the other team gets a chance to steal the chips that remain in the bin.  If the remaining chips are not stolen, they go back to the guessing team.  The object is to fill up your side of the board with correctly guessed or stolen chips.&#10;&#10;";1993;6.17713;1.4;4;100;20;16;Memory, Party Game;team give clue rest team possibly card contain word phrase know clue throw chip bin time word clue elect stop begin recall word clue memory get word correct guess chip take bin guesser clue miss forget chip stay bin guessing complete time run team get chance steal chip remain bin remain chip steal guess team object fill correctly guess steal chip
2816;Crossfire;"This game is played on a large board like a soccer field, approx 100x80cm. The players each have a rotating plastic gun attached to their end of the board, behind a wire goal frame. The idea is to fire ball bearings from the gun to knock your puck into your opponents goal, and keep theirs  away from yours. The board is slightly curved to cause the balls to roll into pots at each end for re-use.&#10;&#10;A new version has been released by MB. The new version has more than one puck, and a smaller, rounded board. The original version came out in the 1970's and had a rectangular board and simple round pucks.&#10;&#10;This game is similar to Gunfight at OK Corral.&#10;&#10;";1971;5.38923;1.1136;2;2;10;7;Action / Dexterity, Real-time, Sports;large like soccer field approx x cm rotate plastic gun attach end wire frame idea fire ball bearing gun knock puck opponent theirs away slightly curve cause ball pot end use new release mb new puck small rounded original come rectangular simple puck similar gunfight ok corral
2818;UNO Attack!;"UNO, America's No. 1-selling card game, has a whole new twist. You'll still encounter all the elements that make UNO so unpredictable and challenging, but add to that a motorized card launcher that shows no mercy and you've got UNO Attack. The object of the game is still to get rid of all your cards. The UNO command cards direct the game by telling players when to trade hands, discard, reverse the playing order, or skip a player. Beware the dreaded Hit command, though, as this translates into a game of Russian roulette. You never know when the card launcher is going to fire off a stream of UNO cards just for you!

2820;Astromagie;"In the card game of astrological magic players hold six cards and on their turn may play up to 3&#10;or refuse by discarding one and replenishing from the stock. Cards come in 4 types:  signs,&#10;elements, planets and aspects, and are played to a row of 6 under strict rules.  When every &#10;player has refused to play a card, the last player to have played scores. He adds up the&#10;number of matches he has in columns 1-3 and multiplies by the planet number in column 4&#10; to receive points on paper.

2822;UrÃ¤us;"This two to four-player race game uses a Mehen board (a spiral of 64 squares).  The designer kept the random aspect (which he's done otherwise only with his Pharao game), but used a standard die instead of the Ancient Egyptian throwing sticks.  Each player has three pieces which he tries to bring all the way in to the serpent's head.  I don't think you can take opposing pieces (sending them back to the serpent's tail), but it seems you can form blockages and maybe even you can move back and forth as desired.&#10;&#10;Check out the beautiful board at Pharao-Brettspiele's home page.&#10;&#10;";1993;5.16667;1.0;2;4;45;7;Abstract Strategy, Ancient, Dice;race use mehen spiral square designer keep random aspect pharao standard die instead ancient egyptian throwing stick piece try bring way serpent head don t think oppose piece send serpent tail form blockage maybe forth desire check beautiful pharao brettspiele home page

2826;Jackpot Yahtzee;"To get the highest accumulative score at the end of 3 rounds of play by strategically dropping your tiles in your rack so that they stack up into rows that score horizontally or diagonally but not vertically. On your turn you roll the 4 dice which all have symbols on them. The symbols are cherries, oranges, bells, and dollar signs. If you roll two or more of a symbol you get that tile to place in your rack. If you roll one of each you get your choice. Dollar signs are worth the most then bells, oranges, and then cherries. The more points a symbol is worth the lesser chance it will come up on the dice.

2832;Great Western Railway Game;"The Great Western Railway (GWR) was one of the earliest railway companies, founded 1835, and built largely by the great British engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel. It ran from London to the West Country &amp; Wales, and was nicknamed God's Wonderful Railway. This game was produced as a 150th anniversary edition by Gibson Games (and re-issued later) and has a jigsaw board showing the rail network and a deck of 80 cards in coloured sets. Players move their tokens around the main lines and branch lines, collecting, swapping and forfeiting cards to get sets. Movement is determined only by the lines and junctions. The rules say the game was inspired by a railwayman Richard Morris, but the board shows copyright Sara Finch &amp; Leslie Scott.&#10;&#10;5,000 copies were made, each with a serial number on the rulebook. A subsequent print run was not numbered and had a few minor changes to the rules.&#10;&#10;";1985;5.05897;1.0;2;6;90;8;Trains;great western railway gwr early railway company found build largely great british engineer isambard kingdom brunel run london west country amp wale nickname god wonderful railway produce th anniversary gibson games issue later jigsaw show rail network deck card coloured set token main line branch line collect swap forfeit card set determine line junction inspire railwayman richard morris show copyright sara finch amp leslie scott copy serial number rulebook subsequent print run number minor change
2836;Dragonlance Mage Stones;"Very vaguely themed to the AD&amp;D Dragonlance campaign background. The board is a grid 7 x 9, with columns numbered 3-9, columns representing planes of reality, rows representing schools of magic, though this has no effect on gameplay. The board &quot;wraps&quot; top to bottom, but not for the purposes of diagonal capture.&#10;&#10;Players roll 3d3 (six sided dice numbered 1-3 twice), and place their coloured tokens on a space in the column matching the dice total. The exception to this is where the three dice are all different, where the player misses a turn &quot;distracted by events in the prime material plane.&quot; When a player rolls all three dice the same, they get another turn after placing their stone.&#10;&#10;Capture of opposition stones is in the style of Othello/Reversi, but captured stones are removed from the board and returned to their owner. First player to place all their stones wins.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Let's Do Lunch! &#10;&#10;&#10;";1990;5.96504;1.4545;2;6;10;10;Abstract Strategy, Dice, Fantasy;vaguely ad amp d dragonlance campaign background grid x column number column represent plane reality row represent school magic effect wrap purpose diagonal capture d sided dice number twice place coloured token space column match dice total exception dice different miss distract event prime material plane dice place stone capture opposition stone style othello reversi capture stone remove return owner place stone implement let lunch

2840;Heuchel und Meuchel;"Heuchel und Meuchel has a medieval look to the board and tiles, as players try to move characters of different social class up the courtly ladder to their goals. The tiles are of six characters; The Fire-Eater, The Minstrel, The Quack, The Bishop, The Lady &amp; The Prince, each tile having a distinctive background pattern. There are 6 tiles of each, numbered from 1 to 6. The board is a simple grid of columns, having starting and finishing squares with patterns matching the tiles. Players draw 6 tiles each and place them on their starting squares, stacking them if necessary. Then they move a tile, or a stack or an upper part of a stack, up their column to the next free space.&#10;&#10;When you place a tile, if there is another player's tile on the same row with the same value, it is taken under protection of yours, by placing it under yours to make a stack. You then have another move. So if the 4 Minstrel ends on the same row as the 4 Lady, she is taken under his wing. This can be done in the finishing area too and if this reveals a tile beyond its station, that is removed as a penalty to its owner. When a tile reaches its matching finishing square, it is turned over and is done with. When only one player can move, the game ends and you score. For each tile that reached its place or beyond, you score its value, deducting any penalties. Most points wins. There is a variant using a die to control your moves.&#10;&#10;An odd movement game, with some thought and memory needed for the knock-on effect, but not a great game. Nice to look at though.&#10;&#10;";1990;5.15341;1.5;3;6;30;12;Medieval;heuchel und meuchel medieval look tile try character different social class courtly ladder tile character fire eater minstrel quack bishop lady amp prince tile have distinctive background pattern tile number simple grid column having start finish square pattern match tile draw tile place starting square necessary tile upper column free space place tile tile row value take protection place minstrel end row lady take wing finish area reveal tile station remove penalty owner tile reach matching finishing square end tile reach place value deduct penalty die odd thought memory need knock effect great nice look
2842;TransAmerica;"TransAmerica is a simple railway game. Each player has a set of five cities strung across the U.S. that need to be connected by rail. Players first place their station on an intersection on the map, then take turns placing one or two rails each turn on the lines of the map. Initially they can place only adjacent to their station or on a line that touches their station, but once their network connects with another player's, they can place anywhere along the combined network.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the first player completes a connected route between their five cities.

2844;Throneworld;"Players expand from their home world to explore systems, starting at the edges of a board and working inward towards the center Throneworld.  The systems get progressively tougher as players move inward which often involves battling units of greater size and/or technology level.  The interesting mechanics allows players to choose 11 different unit types (6 space and 5 ground) to organize into fleets, explore and conquer worlds.  In addition, there are four types of technology: Space Combat, Ground Combat, Jump (controls how far a fleet may move), and Communications (controls the distance you can control fleets).  Players compete to be the first to control a certain number of systems for a full turn.

2854;Exploration;"Exploration was a very popular 1970s game from Britain's best game company, Waddingtons. The dramatic &amp; colourful box cover, showing the Kon Tiki raft, mountain climbers, ziggurats, and scuba divers on a wreck, inspired thousands of British kids to explore the globe, at least in their fantasies. To win, you must mount an exploration to one of four Objectives (Lost City, Summit, Island and Sunken Galleon), return to base and make the most money. Being first back was not enough, you've got to make the best profit on your trip.&#10;The game is played in 2 phases; initially you move round the outer track on die rolls, collecting Personnel cards, buying Equipment cards and drawing Exploration Club cards (which may gain or cost you cash to the Prize Fund). When your group is assembled, take the appropriate dobber (Yacht, Lorry, Tent or Ship) and set off.&#10;The 2nd phase has you moving over land or sea using the unique Diradice, a d6 with a 5 symbols. These allow you to move 1 or 2 spaces orthogonally or diagonally. The problem is that the spaces on the board are littered with symbols which you can only cross if you have the correct equipment, like the compass, dinghy or mountain boots. You must have an explorer with the Main Objective to reach your goal, but the other personnel allow you to avoid hazards and reach Lesser Objectives (Skeleton, Pearls, Rare Flower etc.) to gain cash. 1st, 2nd and 3rd home get cash and 1st back gets the Prize Fund.&#10;A pretty simple game of dice rolling, the only real choice is when to launch your trip.

Players use a Record Sheet and the rules are in English and German.&#10;&#10;Players represent national car manufacturers trying to export cars to six other countries. Combining the placing some export cars in the markets on the board and secretly noting the remaining export cars on your Record Sheet, players also assign advertising budgets to the markets. Each market has a export limit that it can accept and the cars go for a fixed price in each market, so whoever spends more money on advertising gets to sell their cars first. But before revealing the spending, players play one of their Market Cards, which affect the Market in various ways (e.g. 36 - Car of the Year, Sweden will sell all its cars in the USA). After the market is reorganized, players then determine what cars are actually sold and how much Sales Revenue they have earned. Then subtract costs from sales to give profit. For each $10,000 profit you earn, you move your scoring marker one space on the scoring track. First round the track wins.&#10;&#10;Reportedly a fun game, it drew some criticism in Sumo for the imbalance caused by the Market Cards. The designer replied and suggested which cards might stand removing (7 to 17, 26, 27 and 35). Ian's reply is on the Game Cabinet and makes interesting reading today.&#10;&#10;";1991;5.98235;1.8571;4;6;60;13;Economic, Industry / Manufacturing;automania motor giant ian livingstone second self produce boomtown limited simple track large flag country nice wooden car shape piece color large car numbered deck market card english german affect use record sheet english german represent national car manufacturer try export car country combine place export car market secretly note remain export car record sheet assign advertising budget market market export limit accept car fix price market spend money advertising get sell car reveal spending market card affect market way e g car year sweden sell car usa market reorganize determine car actually sell sale revenue earn subtract cost sale profit profit earn marker space track track reportedly fun draw criticism sumo imbalance cause market card designer reply suggest card stand remove ian reply cabinet make interesting reading today
2865;Kersplatt!;"Kersplatt! is a food fight card game. Players at a dinner party throw food at each other over the table and try to dodge what is thrown at them in a vain effort to stay clean. Players are dealt 5 cards each and the rest are laid face down to form the table. The cards are FOOD to be thrown (having a Splat Factor and Dodge Factor), DODGE to dodge food (having a Dodge Factor), EVENT cards (e.g. Catch, Grab, Oops, Butler etc.) to allow actions, and OBJECT cards (e.g. the host's furniture, paintings etc.). You play cards onto each other and draw from the table until the cards run out. If you dodge food, it might hit an object and the host will hassle the thrower (who misses goes). When players can no longer play cards, whoever has the least food on them is &quot;allowed to think they have won&quot;.&#10;The production is fairly simple, the graphics are basic (b &amp; w), and the rules are chatty and a bit unclear. The result is an OK game that tries to be funny.

2866;The London Game;"The London Game has a board showing the centre of the innovative map of the London Underground, updated over the years as the game was re-issued and the Tube developed. Starting at a mainline terminus, players must travel the network, visiting 6 tourist locations on Souvenir cards dealt from a deck of 30, stopping at the relevant Tube station and finally returning to their starting point. You move from station to station on the roll of the die, but to change lines you must stop at junctions and draw a Hazard card. This may move you or other players around the board. You may also close stations with a token when you leave, to block other players. &#10;The later editions have 36 full colour cards and some changes in the locations, but nobody bothered rewriting the rules text at all in 20 years!&#10;&#10;Sibling: The Boston Game&#10;Sibling: The New York Game&#10;&#10;";1972;5.48749;1.5;2;6;30;7;Trains;london show centre innovative map london underground update year issue tube develop start mainline terminus travel network visit tourist location souvenir card deal deck stop relevant tube station finally return starting station station die change line stop junction draw hazard card close station token leave block later colour card change location bother rewrite text year sible boston sible new york

The board is made up of two rotating overlays over a six colored board layout. There are always four spaces of each color showing. The player gains movement points according to how many spaces of one type they occupy; each movement point may be used to move a piece one place, or rotate an overlay one step. Players may be eliminated by having their chosen color occupied by another player.

2870;The Fishing Game;"Anglepen's Original The Fishing Game is a beautiful, lovingly made production of a fishing sim. It features a large three-fold board of a fine painted lake, sets of large cards with excellent artwork and unbelievably, 6 different solid pewter figures of fishers and two little pewter rowboats. There is even a Record Book to keep a diary of your days by the lake.&#10;And days it will be, because, despite the wonderful attention to detail and genuine care taken in its making, this is a deadly dull game of dice rolling and dice rolling and dice rolling. You first seed the board with little paper tiles showing fish on one side &amp; their weight hidden below. Then you have to roll dice to walk round the lake to your chosen fishing spot (why???), roll dice to use the rowboat, roll dice to hook a fish, roll dice to reel it in, roll dice as the fish runs and so on. The cards are used as part of landing the fish, being Run, Hazard &amp; Problem cards. So it may run straight to you, but if it slips into the reeds, you lose your catch.&#10;No doubt habitual fishers will enjoy the tedium and it may well be a fine simulation of the sport, but any gamers will go mad.&#10;&#10;Absolutely typical for a British product, a classic case of theme before game, no idea of a mechanism beyond dice and hazard cards.

2896;Strike It Rich;"Strike It Rich Playing The Stock Market appears to be a Monopoly clone share dealing game, but isn't. The board has the usual track of famous British companies (Tarmac, Racal, Tesco, Courts), decks of Fact Cards and Venture Cards, a die showing cash gains, a huge stack of plastic money chips for each player and a genuine Casio HL-811 calculator in its own box!&#10;You need the calculator because the game also has a book of actual weekly share prices for each company. On your turn, you buy into one firm or another by placing chips onto the board. Later you may sell your investment, making a profit or loss as the prices fluctuate. You draw a Fact Card, which gives info about the price of gold, the currency exchange rates, the FTSE index (the UK's Dow Jones) for a certain week. Based on that info, you decide if your shares will be up or down and whether to sell or hold. If you sell, the Banker checks the actual price in the Market booklet and debits or credits you accordingly. Rolling a VC on the die draws a Venture Card, with the usual hazards and gains to your cash.&#10;More of a crude stock market simulation than a game of strategy, the makers proposed selling fresh decks of Fact Cards and Market booklet for successive years.&#10;&#10;";1986;4.0;1.0;2;6;120;0;Economic;strike rich stock market appear monopoly clone share dealing isn t usual track famous british company tarmac racal tesco court deck fact card venture card die show cash gain huge plastic money chip genuine casio hl calculator box need calculator book actual weekly share price company buy firm place chip later sell investment make profit loss price fluctuate draw fact card give info price gold currency exchange rate ftse index uk dow jones certain week base info decide share sell hold sell banker check actual price market booklet debit credit accordingly vc die draw venture card usual hazard gain cash crude stock market simulation strategy maker propose sell fresh deck fact card market booklet successive year

There wasn't much to do in Britain in the 70s.&#10;The game has a board of a 6x6 grid of squares giving certain instructions, a deck of cards showing stamps which fall into various categories (Great Britain, USA, Animals, First Day Covers etc), and some playing cash. Players also have 4 markers to block the board to other players. Players are dealt 5 stamps to start and may swap one with the stamp dealer (banker). Then you roll 2 dice and choose which instruction on the board to follow. So if you roll a 2 and 4, you can use the instruction at 2/4 or at 4/2 on the grid. Players buy, swap, sell, auction, exhibit, damage or fake their stamps until they make a winning set collection.&#10;The stamps are nice.&#10;&#10;";1972;5.38462;0.0;3;6;90;0;Economic, Negotiation;stanley gibbon collect say box share excitement tension build major stamp stanley gibbon famous uk firm sell postage stamp collector publish promote hobby wasn t britain x grid square give certain instruction deck card show stamp fall category great britain usa animal day cover etc cash marker block deal stamp start swap stamp dealer banker dice choose instruction follow use instruction grid buy swap sell auction exhibit damage fake stamp set stamp nice

2901;GolfMania;"It's just like playing golf -- only faster, funnier, and uses cards and dice instead of balls and clubs. Bad pants, while recommended, are not required. &#10;Okay!  it's nothing like playing golf. But it's still a lot of fun!&#10;&#10;Golfmania is a wacky, fast-paced card game for 2 to 6 players. The object of the game is to complete 18 holes of golf through equal parts luck, strategy, and the sincere desire to see your opponents suffer. It's a game the whole family can enjoy: the rule are simple, the cards are fun and colorful, and you can play it in under 20 minutes.&#10;&#10;Here's a quick overview of what the game is like: At the beginning of each turn, a &quot;Hole&quot; card is drawn. Each Hole card is worth a certain number of hole points if you win it, so you take a swing (i.e., roll the die) and give it your best shot. Everyone   gets a chance to swing, and everyone gets to play cards which affect that swing -- freaky weather, lucky gophers, hi-tech golf equipment and other zany events are sure to change the way you play golf.&#10;&#10;Did you win the Hole? Great! You're a few points closer to your winning goal of 18 hole points. If not -- no matter, you'll just have try again on the next Hole card... and get revenge on the opponent who nailed you with that nasty card last turn.&#10;&#10;";1997;5.13864;1.24;2;6;20;12;Action / Dexterity, Card Game, Party Game, Real-time, Sports;like golf fast funny use card dice instead ball club bad pant recommend require okay like golf lot fun golfmania wacky fast pace card object complete hole golf equal part luck strategy sincere desire opponent suffer family enjoy simple card fun colorful minute quick overview like beginning hole card draw hole card worth certain number hole swing e die good shot get chance swing get card affect swing freaky weather lucky gopher hi tech golf equipment zany event sure change way golf hole great close hole matter ll try hole card revenge opponent nail nasty card
2902;Twilight Imperium: Armada;"(Not to be confused with the Twilight Imperium: Twilight Armada accessory)&#10;&#10;The galaxy is engulfed in terrible conflict. Fleets of havoc are patrolling ancient borders in space and impressive armadas, bent on destruction, are penetrating deep into enemy systems. It is a time of skill and cunning, a time of tactics and planning, it is a time of war. Armada is set in the rich and popular Twilight Imperium universe where players take control of one of the four major races of the crumbled empire, and must battle for glory and survival. Filled to the brim with ships of war, personnel, and technologies, Armada is a customizable game of strategic resource allocation and tactical space warfare.&#10;&#10;Take control of the unique capabilities of each race's fleet:&#10;&#10;Federation of Sol&#10;Sardakk N'orr&#10;Barony of Letnev&#10;Emirates of Hacan&#10;&#10;Each ship is a die-cut counter that you move by &quot;flipping&quot; (Diskwars or Range Wars players will be familiar with this system). Each ship has their stats clearly printed on the tile so there are no sheets to cross reference. Combat is resolved by tossing Hit Counters to see how much damage you do. If the damage penetrates the opponent's shields, they must check for Critical Hits. This is an exciting alternative to dice rolling.&#10;&#10;Overall a very fun and simple space combat game, not to mention an inexpensive alternative to miniatures.&#10;&#10;Another note of interest, when the Star Trek Red Alert! game went out of print Fantasy Flight Games continued the game in their Twilight Imperium universe. The two games are compatible but the big difference is that Armada doesn't have cloaking technology but does have Squadrons. Squadrons are comprised of Fighters or Bombers and both are extremely nasty. If you play against an opponent with a Carrier, you're a sitting duck unless you include some fighters of your own.&#10;&#10;The Twilight Imperium: Armada &#226;&#128;&#147; Stellar Matter pack is the ultimate terrain expansion, with all the asteroids, mine fields, planets, space docks, and planetary defense systems you'll ever need.

2903;The Hunt for Red October;"The Hunt for Red October depicts &quot;modern&quot; naval combat in the North Atlantic, Soviets vs. Nato.&#10;&#10;The game contains 8 scenarios that place various combinations of aircraft, surface ships, and submarines at the players' disposal. The map is broken up into irregular &quot;spaces&quot; containing land, shallow or deep sea. Land spaces may contain airbases and/or ports; sea spaces may contain standing detection patrols (SOSUS, etc).&#10;&#10;Pieces are double sided cardboard of 3 different sizes (capital ships/task forces, small ships/submarines, and aircraft) with the back only giving the basic information (a formation of aircraft, a submarine silhouette or a Task Force symbol) to keep the specific information of the unit secret from the opponent. Each unit has a detection rating and an attack rating.&#10;&#10;Each side starts each turn with a random number of detection attempts (2+d10 for NATO, 2+d6 for Soviet). Pieces are moved on the board (ships/subs up to 3 spaces, aircraft up to 1, 4, or 8 depending on type). As opposing pieces are moved into the same spaces, detection attempts are spent trying to locate the enemy units in the space (usually d10 &lt;= detection rating). Detected units are turned sideways so both sides can see it. Once units are found combat may be initiated.&#10;&#10;Combat is done in two attack phases. Dice are rolled vs. the attack rating of the attacking unit(s) (usually 1 d10 but there are exceptions) and hits are determined and resolved simultaneously. Ships that did not fire in the first phase conduct a second attack phase. Units can be in combat if not detected but upon firing become detected (which means undetected units almost invariably shoot in the second phase). Hits are again determined. 1, 2 or 3 hits (subs, small surface ships, large surface ships) are required to destroy a unit. Aircraft are destroyed only if the hit on them was a rolled 1 or 2. Victory is determined by scenario conditions. There are several optional rules, none of which appear to significantly increase the complexity of the game.&#10;&#10;";1988;6.00606;2.4717;2;2;60;12;Modern Warfare, Nautical, Novel-based, Wargame;hunt red october depict modern naval combat north atlantic soviet vs nato contain place combination aircraft surface ship submarine disposal map break irregular space contain land shallow deep sea land space contain airbase port sea space contain stand detection patrol sosus etc piece double side cardboard different size capital ship task force small ship submarine aircraft give basic information formation aircraft submarine silhouette task force symbol specific information unit secret opponent unit detection rating attack rating start random number detection attempt d nato d soviet piece ship sub space aircraft depend oppose piece space detection attempt spend try locate enemy unit space usually d lt detection rating detect unit sideways side unit find combat initiate combat attack dice vs attack rating attack unit usually d exception hit determined resolve simultaneously ship fire conduct second attack unit combat detect fire detect mean undetected unit invariably shoot second hit determined hit sub small surface ship large surface ship require destroy unit aircraft destroy hit rolled determine condition optional appear significantly increase complexity
2904;John Prados' Third Reich;"(from Avalanche Press website:)&#10;&#10;Third Reich interweaves not only the land, naval and air struggles, but also the equally important economic and political battles. Players must guide their nation to victory by capturing key objectives while making sure no one else &mdash; in particular their allies &mdash; gets there first.&#10;&#10;Players take on the leadership of Britain, France, Italy, Germany, the United States or the Soviet Union. Each of these major powers, in turn, can influence smaller countires like Turkey, Greece or Romania to join the war on their side. They can offer bribes or territory, and sometimes it&rsquo;s more important to decrease someone else&rsquo;s influence than to build up your own.&#10;&#10;The currency of the game is the Basic Resource Point, or BRP. This represents the financial, industrial and agricultural production needed to wage war. BRP&rsquo;s are used to build new units, to pay for offensives, to replace losses suffered in battle, to bribe minor countries, and for a host of other purposes. Each country&rsquo;s production can be affected by conquering or losing territory, or through strategic warfare (chiefly, attacks by submarines and bombers).&#10;&#10;Once activated (usually at a cost in BRP&rsquo;s), land, naval and air units can move and attack enemy units. Combat is resolved by rolling dice, with a result of 6 usually equalling a hit. There are no Combat Results Tables; every factor counts and there are no &ldquo;perfect numbers&rdquo; of units to commit to battle as in some wargames. When a land unit is hit, BRP&rsquo;s can be used to absorb some of the damage, but too many hits and it is reduced in strength or destroyed. Naval and air units pack a greater punch, but don&rsquo;t bounce back from damage as easily.&#10;&#10;Scenarios, or game situations, begin the game in 1938, 1939, 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944 or 1945. Political markers are randomly chosen to determine what events might take place outside the players&rsquo; control: Poland might capitulate to Germany in 1939, Mussolini, Churchill or Hitler might unleash some stupid scheme the Italian, British or German player will have to execute, oil could be found in Libya, the French navy could rally to the Allies or the Axis, jets can be developed, good Germans might kill Hitler &mdash; dozens of such events are possible.&#10;&#10;&#10;As one of the most popular games of all time, our edition of Third Reich has also spawned a sequel, Great Pacific War. The two games can be played together or separately.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;(BGG description:)Avalanche Press' re-release of the original classic. This is a significant overhaul based on the Avalon Hill Third Reich, and has nothing to do with the later Advanced Third Reich.&#10;&#10;There has been dramatic simplification and streamlining, however. Gone is the CRT, replaced by a Columbia-esque &quot;roll lots of dice&quot; combat resolution system. The whole front/option system has been revised with an &quot;HQ activation marker&quot; system: each nation buys activation markers for HQs, land, and air units, and puts them in a cup. Turn order is then determined by draws. Naval and air systems have been overhauled and simplified: sea zones now regulate movement. Tactical air support is now limited to being equal to the strength of the attacker/defender, not three times.&#10;&#10;Also includes 1938 (Spanish Civil War boils over to a general European conflict) and 1945 scenarios (Western Allies and Russia fall out after collapse of Germany).&#10;&#10;";2001;6.50482;4.0;2;5;360;12;Economic, Wargame, World War II;avalanche press website reich interweave land naval air struggle equally important economic political battle guide nation capture key make sure mdash particular ally mdash get leadership britain france italy germany united states soviet union major power influence small countire like turkey greece romania join war offer bribe territory rsquo important decrease rsquo influence build currency basic resource brp represent financial industrial agricultural production need wage war brp rsquo build new unit pay offensive replace loss suffer battle bribe minor country host purpose country rsquo production affect conquer territory strategic warfare chiefly attack submarine bomber activate usually cost brp rsquo land naval air unit attack enemy unit combat resolve dice result usually equal hit combat result table factor count ldquo perfect number rdquo unit commit battle wargame land unit hit brp rsquo absorb damage hit reduce strength destroy naval air unit pack great punch don rsquo t bounce damage easily situation begin political marker randomly choose determine event place outside rsquo poland capitulate germany mussolini churchill hitler unleash stupid scheme italian british german execute oil find libya french navy rally ally axis jet develop good german kill hitler mdash dozen event possible popular time reich spawn sequel great pacific war separately bgg description avalanche press release original classic significant overhaul base avalon hill reich later advanced reich dramatic simplification streamlining go crt replace columbia esque lot dice combat resolution option revise hq activation marker nation buy activation marker hqs land air unit put cup order determine draw naval air overhaul simplified sea zone regulate tactical air support limit equal strength attacker defender time include spanish civil war boil general european conflict western ally russia fall collapse germany

Movement is handled through rounds of card play during which cards are played and then reacted to in order to eliminate all the cards in your hand.  Dinosaur cards have values ranging from 1-5 while Escape cards have values ranging from +1 to +3.  In order to play a Dinosaur atop another Dinosaur, it must be greater in value than the preceding card.

2918;The Last Crusade;"A quick yet realistic game of World War II combat that recreates the Allied campaign from the hedgerows of Normandy to the crossing of the Rhine and the capture of Germany's industrial heartland. As the commander of an army regiment, U.S. or German, you'll control platoon-sized elements of infantry, armor, artillery, air and support units, each represented by a playing card. Your goal: decisive victory with the overrun of the enemy's HQ (easiest to obtain if you command the well-provisioned invading Americans), or at the very least the crippling halt of your opponent's offensive (sometimes the only route to victory for the heavily-armed but somewhat beleaguered Germans). Either way, only shrewd tactics, careful use of resources, and the sheer guts of the battle-hardened separate the victorious from the defeated.&#10;&#10;Sold as starter decks (2 are the minimum for the game) and Booster Packs, this collectible card game evokes the feel of simple miniatures play.&#10;&#10;Starters and Boosters favor Rares well so collecting is easy.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.64953;2.625;2;2;120;10;Card Game, Collectible Components, Wargame, World War II;quick realistic world war ii combat recreate allied campaign hedgerow normandy crossing rhine capture germany industrial heartland commander army regiment u german ll platoon sized element infantry armor artillery air support unit represent playing card decisive overrun enemy hq easy obtain command provision invade americans crippling halt opponent offensive route heavily armed somewhat beleaguered germans way shrewd tactic careful use resource sheer gut battle harden separate victorious defeat sell starter deck minimum booster pack collectible card evoke feel simple miniature starter booster favor rare collecting easy
2919;Search for the Emperor's Treasure;"Originally published in issue #51 (July 1981) of Dragon Magazine.&#10;&#10;A tongue-in-cheek version of &quot;classic&quot; Dungeons &amp; Dragons (some even say Mertwig's Maze is a similar treatment of Advanced D&amp;D).  As such, players become a warrior, elf, cleric, or magician, then wander around the board collecting treasure and resolving encounters.  The Emperor's six magic artifacts are both high-powered magic items and a countdown clock, as when enough have been found, the game ends. (Exactly how many depends on number of players.)&#10;&#10;Treasure, encounters and equipment are all randomized with chits in three cups. Characters obtain them by fighting monsters or lucky die rolls on result charts associated with various board locations (e.g., castles, villages, The Wizard's Tower, The Pirate Lair, etc.).  Not all encounters are monsters -- some are travelers who will bestow treasure upon completion of quests, others are annoyances, and there's even Imperial Guard patrols looking to confiscate the Emperor's Treasure.&#10;&#10;Terrain types are a key strategy feature, as a player whose current location's terrain doesn't match the encounter drawn can bestow it on someone else who does.  So a character in rugged forest or mountains can get stuck fighting several monsters in succession during other players' turns.&#10;&#10;A surprising amount of flavor is included for a magazine game.  There's an assortment of magic spells, ranged and close combat, magical weapons &amp; armor, damsels in distress, evil wizards, a volcanic demon, even a wandering elephant.&#10;&#10;A significantly revised version was published as part of The Best of Dragon Magazine Games.&#10;&#10;";1981;6.97137;1.7619;2;10;60;10;Adventure, Economic, Exploration, Fantasy, Fighting;originally publish issue july dragon magazine tongue cheek classic dungeon amp dragon mertwig maze similar treatment advanced d amp d warrior elf cleric magician wander collect treasure resolving encounter emperor magic artifact high power magic item countdown clock find end exactly depend number treasure encounter equipment randomize chit cup character obtain fight monster lucky die result chart associate location e g castle village wizard tower pirate lair etc encounter monster traveler bestow treasure completion quest annoyance imperial guard patrol look confiscate emperor treasure terrain key strategy current location terrain doesn t match encounter draw bestow character rugged forest mountain stick fight monster succession surprising flavor include magazine assortment magic spell range close combat magical weapon amp armor damsel distress evil wizard volcanic demon wandering elephant significantly revise publish good dragon magazine games

2932;Hnefatafl;"Hnefatafl, also known as The Viking Game, The King's Table or simply Tafl, is one of those two-player games where the opposing sides are not equal in number. The defending side comprises twelve soldiers and a king, who start the game in a cross formation in the center of the board. Their objective is for the king to escape by reaching any of the four corner squares. The attackers comprise 24 soldiers positioned in four groups of 6 around the perimeter of the board. All pieces move like the Rook in chess and pieces are taken by &quot;sandwiching&quot; i.e. moving your piece so that an opponent's piece is trapped horizontally or vertically between two of yours. There is a host of information on the Internet about Hnefatafl, including many rule variations that are worth experimenting with.&#10;&#10;A copy of the game was published in issue #128 of Dragon magazine, Dec 1987 (later republished as part of a boxed set: The Best of Dragon Magazine Games in 1990).&#10;&#10;One of the oldest games in the world - traced in various versions to the Vikings, Welsh, Saxons, and Irish.

2936;Dice Run;"Dice don't have legs, but in Dice Run they'll scamper as quickly as they can to get ahead of their fellow cubic cross-country runners. If you play your cards right, you'll be backing the winners and score thanks to their efforts.&#10;&#10;Dice Run includes thirty dice, with six dice in each of five different colors. To start the game, you roll these dice on the table to form the starting pack of runners. Each player has a hand of three movement cards and four secret target cards; these latter cards show a die with a particular number and color.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player plays a movement card and carries out its effect. If he chooses a red movement card, for example, all of the red dice &quot;break out&quot; of the pack and move ahead to form the leading group of runners. If the next player plays a 5 movement card, she first moves ahead all of the 5s from the leading group &ndash; thereby forming a new leading group &ndash; then she moves all the 5s from the next group in line ahead one group. Movement cards also allow players to switch the position of two non-leading groups, to drop a die from the leading group to the back of the pack, to flip all the dice in a group that match a particular number, to have three dice break out from the leading group, and so on. Alternatively, a player can place a movement card face down on the table, then roll all the dice in a non-leading group; he can't take this option again until another player makes such a roll. After playing a card, he refills his hand to three movement cards.&#10;&#10;A player can also choose to use one of his secret target cards to move the dice, first moving all the dice of the matching number, then all dice of the matching color, or vice versa. This card remains on the table.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, the movement deck is seeded with four stage cards valued 3-6. When a stage card is revealed, players each simultaneously reveal one of their secret target cards. (If a player used a target card for movement, he must choose this card.) For each die in the leading group that matches the color of this card, the player scores 1 point; he also scores 1 point for each matching number. If a die is identical to his target card, he scores 1 bonus point as well. Whoever has the highest score claims the stage card, which is worth 3-6 stage points. The players with the second- and third-highest scores receive 2 and 1 stage point.&#10;&#10;After four stages, the player with the most stage points wins!&#10;&#10;";2002;5.90278;1.413;2;6;30;10;Dice, Racing;dice don t leg dice run ll scamper quickly ahead fellow cubic cross country runner card right ll back winner thank effort dice run include thirty dice dice different color start dice table form start pack runner hand card secret target card card die particular number color card carry effect choose red card example red dice break pack ahead form lead group runner card ahead lead group ndash form new lead group ndash group line ahead group card allow switch position non lead group drop die lead group pack dice group match particular number dice break lead group alternatively place card face table dice non lead group t option make card refill hand card choose use secret target card dice dice matching number dice matching color vice versa card remain table start deck seed stage card value stage card reveal simultaneously reveal secret target card target card choose card die lead group match color card matching number die identical target card bonus high claim stage card worth stage second high receive stage stage stage
2938;Zatre;"Zatre is short for Zahlen &amp; Treppen, numbers and steps. The publisher was obliged to replace the phrase &quot;scrabbling with numbers&quot; for &quot;dominoes for the 21st century&quot; on the box, but really it is just Scrabble with numbers. And very good for it, it is too. There are 121 tiles with 1-6 dots like a standard die or domino (20 of each number plus an extra 1). Players alternately draw and place 2 tiles on the board extending the pattern already laid. When you make a vertical or horizontal line that totals 10, 11 or 12 (12 is the limit), you score 1, 2 or 4 points accordingly on your game pad. Completing scoring lines on the pad gives a rising bonus and covering marked squares on the board gives you a doubling bonuses on your pad.&#10;&#10;Simple and quick, but surprisingly challenging when you get the idea. The idea being that you must keep an even, balanced score pad, scoring 10s and 11s, not just successive 12s. Easy to pick up, but it requires some effort to score well; spotting those opportunities to place one tile which scores each way, making sure you keep clocking up 10s, to turn into 11s or 12s. Luck does play a role, but good players consistently score highly game after game, so there must be something deeper at work.&#10;The publisher Perner maintains a website with play &amp; chat over the internet and there are several very active Zatre clubs in Germany, Austria &amp; Switzerland. Players results are scored on the ranking table on the website.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by: Zatre: Das Kartenspiel&#10;&#10;";1990;6.34835;2.0417;2;6;45;8;Abstract Strategy;zatre short zahlen amp treppen number step publisher oblige replace phrase scrabble number domino st century box scrabble number good tile dot like standard die domino number plus extra alternately draw place tile extend pattern lay vertical horizontal line total limit accordingly pad completing line pad give rise bonus cover marked square give double bonus pad simple quick surprisingly challenging idea idea balanced pad successive easy pick require effort spot opportunity place tile way make sure clock luck role good consistently highly deep work publisher perner maintain website amp chat internet active zatre club germany austria amp switzerland result rank table website implement zatre das kartenspiel

Bones tend to be found in trash cans and are sometimes given as rewards for successfully delivering newspapers to various establishments.  Players must also pay close attention to their bellies as their hunger level drops with each passing round.

2944;Halli Galli;"Halli Galli is a speed action game in which players watch for sets of exactly five fruit. The deck contains 56 playing cards showing four kinds of fruit in groups of 1 to 5 and a bell of the type found at hotel reception desks.&#10;&#10;The deck is distributed evenly between the players. All players hold their deck face down and take turns dealing one card face up in front of them. As each player reveals her next card, the instant you see a total of five of one kind of fruit on the table, hit the bell. If you're correct, you pick up all the played cards and put them into your deck; if you're wrong, you pay the other players one card each. When you run out of cards, you're out. When two players are left, they play until the bell is struck once more, then the game ends and the taller deck wins.&#10;&#10;Keep in mind that a five-of-a-kind can occur both when cards are revealed and when they're covered. If, for example, cards showing 3, 1 and 4 bananas are on the table and the 3 is then covered by a non-banana card, suddenly five bananas are showing and somebody better be reaching for the bell.&#10;&#10;";1990;5.7967;1.0152;2;6;10;6;Action / Dexterity, Card Game, Children's Game, Party Game, Real-time;halli galli speed action watch set exactly fruit deck contain card show kind fruit group bell find hotel reception desk deck distribute evenly hold deck face deal card face reveal card instant total kind fruit table hit bell correct pick card deck wrong pay card run card leave bell strike end tall deck mind kind occur card reveal cover example card show banana table cover non banana card suddenly banana show somebody well reach bell

2952;Trivial Pursuit: Genus Edition;"Trivial Pursuit is the original trivia game that started it all.&#10;&#10;Each player has a circular playing piece with six pie-shaped holes. The goal of the game is to collect a pie in each color. The colors correspond to different question categories.&#10;&#10;The board consists of a circular track with spaces in seven different colors. Six of the colors correspond to question categories while the last color gives a new dice roll. Six spaces along the track are &quot;pie spaces&quot;, and from these there are &quot;spokes&quot; of track leading to the middle of the board.&#10;&#10;Players roll a die and move along the track in any direction they like.

Then the other player gets to make one free guess. If they're right, they get three letter cards. If they're wrong, the other players get a chance to steal. If they guess the word, they get one letter card. If they have cards, and get it wrong they lose a letter card. If no one guesses the word, another clue is read. If no one gets it the next time around the players will only receive one letter card from that point on.&#10;&#10;Letter cards can be the letters D, I, R, T, or Y; they can also be ~ cards, Wild cards, or Action cards.

2960;Camden;"Camden is a game about drawing and laying cards (acting as tiles) to form a highly abstracted street market. What sets the game apart from other games in the tile-laying genre is that the cards can be placed almost anywhere on the board and in almost any orientation.  Cards may touch at corners, and the corner of one card may touch the side of another.&#10;&#10;Players advance by purchasing stores formed by the cards and collecting revenue from those stores at the beginning of each subsequent turn. Symbols on cards may trigger effects when drawn, either destroying or emptying the largest store, or giving players bonus payouts.&#10;&#10;Victory is achieved by the first player to reach 50 points.&#10;&#10;Since revenue comes from the quality of your store, but other players can play tiles to alter that store, the overall result is a cutthroat mind-bender, making it one of the most popular games of Cheapass&#039;s Hip Pocket Games series. The game was originally released as Agora in 2002, with the theme of an ancient Greek marketplace.&#10;&#10;";2002;6.27009;1.9091;2;4;20;10;Abstract Strategy, Card Game, City Building, Economic, Print & Play;camden draw lay card act tile form highly abstract street market set apart tile lay genre card place orientation card touch corner corner card touch advance purchase store form card collect revenue store beginning subsequent symbol card trigger effect draw destroy empty large store give bonus payout achieve reach revenue come quality store tile alter store overall result cutthroat mind bender make popular cheapass hip pocket series originally release agora ancient greek marketplace
2962;Inner Circle;"In Inner Circle each player places their pieces on the outer rim of the hexagonal board.  On a player's turn, the player moves a piece the number of dots that are underneath that piece (no peeking, it's touch and move).  The aim is to land in survival spots in the board.  After all the spots are claimed, the board is lifted out, and the pieces that didn't make it are left behind.  This repeats until all but one player's pieces are eliminated, or the last piece makes it to the center spot on the fourth board.&#10;&#10;";1981;5.45574;1.6061;2;4;20;8;Abstract Strategy, Maze, Puzzle;inner circle place piece outer rim hexagonal piece number dot underneath piece peeking touch aim land survival spot spot claim lift piece didn t leave repeat piece eliminate piece make center spot fourth
2964;Underwriter;"Underwriter, The Names Game, is an insurance game in which 4 players become Names at Lloyd's of London, taking on risks in the Aviation, Marine, Non-Marine and Motor markets. Each player has a Syndicate board and puts tokens into each Market slot. You roll and move round the board, drawing the relevant market card which may show a profit or loss (eg opening of new airport increases premiums for Aviation syndicates, football team trashing hotel costs Non-marine claims damages). You can also gain Stop Loss markers and face a Solvency test. You win by your Syndicate getting 4 tokens in each Market and passing the Solvency test.&#10;A nicely made set with a quarter-board, but, being a British game, there is no more thought than roll &amp; move and draw hazard cards.

2970;Squatter;"&quot;The Australian Wool Game&quot;&#10;&#10;In Squatter, 2 to 6 Players play as Australian sheep farmers (known colloquially as Squatters) as they work to become the most successful farmer. Each player starts with a sheep station, consisting of 5 Natural Pasture paddocks, fully stocked with 3 'pens' of sheep per paddock. Throughout the game players will earn money by buying and selling their sheep as well as from selling wool once per 'year' (circulation of the board) at the 'Wool sale' space. Players will spend this money to Improve and Irrigate their pastures. As players make their way around the board they will encounter many challenges and face the tribulations of Australian farmers including treating Foot Rot, being injured by a tractor and most devastating of all, droughts. The game ends once one player has Irrigated all of their pastures and stocked each of them with 6 pens of sheep, 30 pens in total, becoming the most successful farmer and winning the game.&#10;&#10;The game has no player elimination element and everyone stays in the game until the end.&#10;&#10;Squatter is a quintessential Australian game, becoming an icon of Australian culture and a staple in many Australian homes since it's release at the Royal Melbourne Show in 1962 on the Australian Wool Bureau stand. Squatter has sold over 500,000 copies and is the most successful board game ever developed in Australia.&#10;&#10;";1962;5.70062;1.4667;2;6;90;10;Animals, Economic, Farming;australian wool squatter australian sheep farmer know colloquially squatter work successful farmer start sheep station consist natural pasture paddock fully stock pen sheep paddock earn money buy sell sheep sell wool year circulation wool sale space spend money improve irrigate pasture way encounter challenge face tribulation australian farmer include treat foot rot injure tractor devastating drought end irrigate pasture stock pen sheep pen total successful farmer elimination element stay end squatter quintessential australian icon australian culture staple australian home release royal melbourne australian wool bureau stand squatter sell copy successful develop australia

You could order a copy for $1.25, complete with 2 boards, rules, and over 80 plastic pieces.&#10;&#10;This game is very similar to Battleship, with a few additional rules.  Each player has a gameboard (printed on cardstock-paper), later boards from the late 70's were printed on plastic with no backing at all, with 3 islands on it.  Players place all of their units on their board (secretly; you can't see your opponent's board) at the beginning of the game.  Units consist of Head Quarters, Tanks, Pill Boxes, Battleships, Destroyers, Landing barges, Aircraft Carriers, and Planes.&#10;&#10;The objective is to locate which island the enemy HQ is on (when you sink the enemy Battleship, they must tell you if their HQ is on the North or South half of the board), destroy all enemy installations in that island, and send a landing barge to occupy it.  You can also win the game by destroying both enemy barges (so they have no way to land on your HQ island anymore) or by destroying all enemy planes and ships (they can no longer attack).&#10;&#10;Jean Shepherd (best known for the movie &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;) mentioned an ad for Task Force on his June 18, 1963 radio show.

2990;Balanx;"Balanx is a 2 player balancing game by Kris Burm. The game has a low plastic see-saw grid with spaced grooves. Players have 10 heavy glass marbles in black and white, the same as found in Abalone, and 2 small steel ball bearings.&#10;Players start with their marbles on the opposite side and corner of the grid and move them towards themselves forwards and sideways, but not diagonally. The trick is that before a player moves, they hold the balancing board down on their side, making the marbles roll along the grooves and changing the set up entirely. In addition, the steel balls run in side grooves, affecting the balance of the board and making the game very challenging.&#10;The winner is the first to get their balls across to their corner, but if any balls are left in the opponents corner to block a finish, you lose. &#10;Rules in English, French, Dutch and Swedish.&#10;&#10;Was awarded the title &quot;Best Abstract Strategy Game&quot; by Games Magazine in 1997.&#10;&#10;";1993;5.29456;1.95;2;2;20;8;Abstract Strategy;balanx balancing kris burm low plastic see grid spaced groove heavy glass marble black white find abalone small steel ball bearing start marble opposite corner grid forwards sideways diagonally trick hold balancing make marble groove change set entirely addition steel ball run groove affect balance make challenge winner ball corner ball leave opponent corner block finish english french dutch swedish award title good abstract strategy magazine

2998;Reds! The Russian Civil War 1918-1921;"Reds! The Russian Civil War 1918-1921 is a two-player wargame covering these dramatic events from August 1918 to the start of 1921, when the last organized opposition to Red rule outside the far east was destroyed.&#10;&#10;The single large-hex map stretches from Warsaw in the west to Omsk in the east and from Murmansk in the north to Tashkent in the south. Across this vast expanse, players maneuver a colorful array of combat units representing various White factions, Anarchists, Nationalists, Alied Intervention Forces, the two divisions of the Czech Legion, and six Polish armies.&#10;&#10;Units range from armies to brigades. The Red Order of Battle is built around 16 Red Armies organized by Leon Trotsky. There are also two powerful Red cavalry armies and the elite Latvian Rifle division. The White Order of Battle includes everything from Cossack cavalry corps to Muslim partisans and a German Free Corps. Each side also has support units: naval and river flotillas, air units, and, of course, the famous armored trains. Key leaders are also included: Frunze, Denikin, Wrangel, and Trotsky and his famous Red Train.&#10;&#10;To model the chaos of this many-sided multi-front war, the sequence of play is based upon random chit pull which determines the order of activation of each White faction or six Red Army Front commands. The key Logistics phase, in which disrupted units are rallied and unsupplied units attritted, is also randomly determined. The game also includes TWO random event tables: one for each side.&#10;From sweeping cavalry advances to slogging matches over major cities (such as Tsaritsyn - the future Stalingrad - know as the Red Verdun), Reds! is a true player's game. It is also a realistic depiction of some of the most titanic and unusual campaigns of modern history.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;    One 22 x 34&quot; Game Map&#10;    One Sheet of 240 Counters&#10;    Two Player Aid Cards&#10;    One Rule Book &#10;&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE     1-2 months per turn&#10;MAP SCALE     65 miles per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE     Brigades, Divisions, Corps, and Armies&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS     Two&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Ted Raicer&#10;DEVELOPER: Andy Lewis and Volko Ruhnke&#10;ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

3000;1806: Rossbach Avenged;"Time: 1600 hrs. October 13, 1806 &#10;Napoleon and Lannes are standing, surveying the situation from the Windknolle. Beyond the slope, they can begin to see the fire lights of the Prussians in the valley. The Saxon General Tauenzien now occupies the Dornberg after earlier relinquishing the Landgrafenberg and, more critically, the bridge over the Saale at Napoleon's back. After studying the glow of Prussian campfires Napoleon correctly surmised the entire Prussian Army was nearby. He mistakenly assumed, however, they were preparing to fight him here. This almost proved fatal for Marshal Davout, approaching from the east. For on the morrow, while Napoleon and the majority of the French fight here, Davout's III Corps alone will engage the bulk of the Prussian Army at Auerstadt.&#10;&#10;1806: Rossbach Avenged includes:&#10;   Rules: Six Days of Glory System &#10;Players: Two (or two teams) &#10;Scenarios: Nine, from meeting engagements to full campaign (the Campaign Scenario can begin on any day.) &#10;Maps: Two 22&quot; x 34&quot; full color maps designed by Joe Youst &#10;Counters: 280 two sided units by Rodger MacGowan &#10;Quick Set-up: one 11 x17 OB Display for each player allows you to set-up (or replay) the entire campaign day-by-day. &#10; GAME SYSTEM: DAYS System  &#10;- scale = 1,600m/hex, &#10;- time = 6 hours/GT, &#10;- strength = 800-1,000 men/SP.&#10;&#10;";1998;7.04333;3.25;2;2;120;12;Napoleonic, Wargame;time hrs october napoleon lanne stand survey situation windknolle slope begin fire light prussian valley saxon general tauenzien occupy dornberg early relinquish landgrafenberg critically bridge saale napoleon study glow prussian campfire napoleon correctly surmise entire prussian army nearby mistakenly assume prepare fight prove fatal marshal davout approach east morrow napoleon majority french fight davout iii corp engage bulk prussian army auerstadt rossbach avenge include day glory team meet engagement campaign campaign begin day map x color map joe youst sided unit rodger macgowan quick set x ob display allow set replay entire campaign day day day scale m hex time hour gt strength man sp
