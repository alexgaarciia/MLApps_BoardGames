1;Die Macher;"Die Macher is a game about seven sequential political races in different regions of Germany. Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The 1986 edition featured four parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players. The 1997 edition supports up to five players in the re-united Germany and updated several features of the rules as well.  The 2006 edition also supports up to five players and adds a shorter five-round variant and additional rules updates by the original designer.&#10;&#10;";1986;7.58832;4.3081
2;Dragonmaster;"Dragonmaster is a trick-taking card game based on an older game called Coup d'&#195;&#137;tat. Each player is given a supply of plastic gems, which represent points. Each player will get to be the dealer for five different hands, with slightly different goals for each hand. After all cards have been dealt out, the dealer decides which hand best suits his or her current cards, and the other players are penalized points (in the form of crystals) for taking certain tricks or cards. For instance, if &quot;first&quot; or &quot;last&quot; is called, then a player is penalized for taking the first or last tricks. All players will get a chance to be dealer for five hands, but other players can steal this opportunity by taking all of the tricks during certain hands. At the end, the biggest pile of gems wins the game.&#10;&#10;Jewel contents:&#10;&#10;10 clear (2 extra)&#10;14 green (2 extra)&#10;22 red (2 extra)&#10;22 blue (2 extra)&#10;&#10;";1981;6.66358;1.9643
3;Samurai;"Samurai is set in medieval Japan. Players compete to gain the favor of three factions: samurai, peasants, and priests, which are represented by helmet, rice paddy, and Buddha figures scattered about the board, which features the islands of Japan. The competition is waged through the use of hexagonal tiles, each of which help curry favor of one of the three factions &mdash; or all three at once! Players can make lightning-quick strikes with horseback ronin and ships or approach their conquests more methodically. As each figure (helmets, rice paddies, and Buddhas) is surrounded, it is awarded to the player who has gained the most favor with the corresponding group.&#10;&#10;Gameplay continues until all the symbols of one type have been removed from the board or four figures have been removed from play due to a tie for influence.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players compare captured symbols of each type, competing for majorities in each of the three types. Ties are not uncommon and are broken based on the number of other, &quot;non-majority&quot; symbols each player has collected.&#10;&#10;The game is part of what is sometimes called the Knizia tile-laying trilogy.&#10;&#10;";1998;7.47583;2.442
4;Tal der KÃ¶nige;"When you see the triangular box and the luxurious, large blocks of Tal der K&ouml;nige (German: &quot;Valley of the Kings&quot;), you can tell this game was designed to be beautiful as well as functional.  The object of the game is to build pyramids out of the different colored blocks.  A pyramid scores more points when it's made from a few colors, but it's much harder to consistently outbid the other players for the necessary blocks.  The game is over when the Pharoah's Pyramid in the center is completed, which is built using all the blocks that the players don't use during the course of the game.&#10;&#10;Final round 1990 Hippodice Spieleautorenwettbewerb.&#10;&#10;";1992;6.6154;2.6875
5;Acquire;"In Acquire, each player strategically invests in businesses, trying to retain a majority of stock.  As the businesses grow with tile placements, they also start merging, giving the majority stockholders of the acquired business sizable bonuses, which can then be used to reinvest into other chains.  All of the investors in the acquired company can then cash in their stocks for current value or trade them 2-for-1 for shares of the newer, larger business.  The game is a race to acquire the greatest wealth.&#10;&#10;History of Acquire: This Sid Sackson classic has taken many different forms over the years depending on the publisher, yet the rules and game play have stayed the same. The 1966 version of the 3M bookshelf edition included rules for a 2-player variant. The original version is part of the 3M Bookshelf Series.&#10;&#10;Many books and websites incorrectly list this as a 1962 publication as the 3M Company used previously copyrighted artwork when they released the game in 1964. 3M actually received the idea for the game of &quot;Vacations&quot; from Sid Sackson in May of 1963 and decided to take his idea and put it into artwork they had developed the year before for a game called &quot;ACQUIRE.&quot; 3M's original game idea for a game called ACQUIRE must not have been very good so they decided to take Sid's idea of Vacations and put it into their concept of ACQUIRE. They released some limited test market games in 8 Midwestern U.S. cities in December of 1963 with a box that had a 1963 copyright. These games had Sid's original rules. When 3M released the mass market games in 1964, they had developed some of Sid's original ideas and changed some rules and game play to match their production desires. They released them with outer boxes that were copyrighted 1962 and inner boxes with rules that were dated 1963.&#10;&#10;December 1963 - Test Market World Map Wood Tile Edition&#10;1964 - Dated 1962/63 wood tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay &amp; stocks with printed backs&#10;1965 - Dated 1962/63 plastic tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay &amp; stocks with printed backs (last edition made with printed backs until 1999)&#10;1966 - Dated 1962/66 plastic tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay &amp; non-wax coated stocks (Only edition with these stocks)&#10;1968 - Dated 1968/66 plastic tiles, clear plastic board with paper underlay (Both 1966 inner box games have a lot of mixed parts)&#10;1971 - Dated 1968/71 plastic tiles, yellow hard plastic board&#10;1975 - 3M sells rights for game of ACQUIRE to the Avalon Hill Company&#10;1976 - Dated 1976 plastic tiles, yellow hard plastic board, redesigned money, no inner box (This edition was also produced in 1977, 79, 81, 82,       &amp; 86)&#10;1989 - Dated 1976 Gray box edition with new box artwork same contents as regular 1976 editions (This edition was also produced in 1992)&#10;1995 - Dated 1995 Large box cardboard edition with chipboard board and tiles, Special Powers Variant Tiles inspired by German editions&#10;1997 - Avalon Hill sells the rights to the game of ACQUIRE to Hasbro&#10;1999 - Dated 1999 Large box with large plastic board and tiles, 3D company buildings, redesigned stocks &amp; money, large info cards&#10;2006 - Hasbro assigns rights for the game of ACQUIRE to their subsidiary, Wizards of the Coast&#10;2006 - Lloyd's (private) Rules of ACQUIRE are made public, two major rule changes that help to bring the balance of the game of ACQUIRE back to the  intentions of Sid Sackson's original ideas.

It contains modified rules and a slightly smaller playing grid. Although these changes have been criticised for not ultimately improving upon Sackson's original design, they are generally regarded as not being too damaging to it.&#10;2023 - Renegade Game Studio partners with Hasbro, and releases their new version, with Classic Mode or Tycoon Mode &mdash; play with or without tertiary stockholder merger bonus. &#10;2024 - The Renegade 60th Anniversary edition includes a set of plastic weighted poker chips, and Special Powers Variant cards.&#10;&#10;";1964;7.3505;2.4923
6;Mare Mediterraneum;"In the ancient lands along the Mediterranean, players attempt to satisfy their unique victory conditions via trade, war and construction.  This lavishly produced game contains tons of wooden game components and a beautiful roll-out vinyl map.  Players produce a score of different commodities to trade with other cities in the hope of creating enough income to fill their capitals with buildings, produce artwork, and fill warehouses with goods.&#10;&#10;";1989;6.4523;3.0
7;Cathedral;"In Cathedral, each player has a set of pieces of a different color. The pieces are in the shapes of buildings, covering from one to five square units. The first player takes the single neutral Cathedral piece and places it onto the board. Players then alternate placing one of their buildings onto the board until neither player can place another building. Players capture territory by surrounding areas that are occupied by at most one opponent or neutral building. A captured piece is removed and captured territory becomes off-limits to the opponent. The player with the fewest 'square units' of buildings that can't be placed wins.&#10;&#10;";1979;6.54958;1.7887
8;Lords of Creation;"In this interesting offering from Warfrog, players become Gods seeking to dominate a world with their followers.  The first part of the game involves constructing the game board, after which players take turns using cards to determine how many new people should appear and what type of terrain they will inhabit.  All tribes start off as barbarians, but soon the calming effect of civilization settles the marauding bands; although civilized tribes score more, they can no longer attack.  What they can do, though, is civilize other players' followers.  Sure it gives opponents more points, but at least those followers won't come after you!&#10;&#10;";1993;6.05322;2.4
9;El Caballero;"Although referred to as a sequel to El Grande, El Caballero shares few aspects with its namesake, being a fun but intense brain-burner in which players explore and attempt to control the lands and waterways of the New World.&#10;&#10;The players are following Columbus by exploring the islands he discovered. Players slowly explore the islands &ndash; by picking and placing land tiles that are most favorable to them &ndash; and discover wealth in the form of gold and fish. As they learn about the land and sea areas of this new land, they position their caballeros to try to maintain control of the important regions. Castillos give them a measure of protection from others, and ships allow them to establish trade and to fish for food. Success is measured in the size of land and sea areas they control. Their success is measured twice, and in the end these scores are summed and the winner declared.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.46943;2.9515
10;Elfenland;"Elfenland is a redesign of the original White Wind game Elfenroads.  The game is set in the mythical world of the elves.  A group of fledgling elves (the players) are charged with visiting as many of the twenty Elfencities as they can over the course of 4 rounds.  To accomplish the task they will use various forms of transportation such as Giant Pigs, Elfcarts, Unicorns, Rafts, Magic Clouds, Trollwagons, and Dragons.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:  Players begin in the Elf capitol, draw one face down movement tile, and are dealt eight transport cards and a secret 'home' city card that they must reach at the end of the 4th round or lose points for each city space away from 'home' they are at the end of the game. Markers of each player's color are placed in each city on the board and are collected when the player visits that city (each counts as 1 point).&#10;  &#10;     The round proceeds in 2 stages.  The first part of the round consists of the drawing of Tiles showing the differing types of transport (except rafts) from a combination of face up and face down tiles (if a player doesn't like the 5 tiles that are face up; they can always draw blind from the face down tiles and hope to get one they need).  These transport tiles need to match the Transportation cards in your hand to use them most effectively.  After each player has a total of 4 tiles they take turns placing a tile on any one of the roads that run between the elf cities.  Only one transport tile may be placed on each road; so players may use other players tiles to travel if they have the matching cards in their hand.  This frequently causes a readjustment of planned travel routes as other players tiles can allow you to move farther or shorter than you had first thought.  Players can play their tiles to help themselves or hinder others by playing a slow mode of transport on another players (perceived) path.&#10;&#10;Each mode of transport has certain terrain it can travel through quickly or slowly, and those that it cannot. These are listed on the top of each transportation card by the number terrain symbols.  The number of terrain symbols equals how many matching cards you must play to move across a given tile in a given terrain.  For example, a Magic Cloud tile placed in a mountain would take one Magic cloud card to travel across (1 mountain symbol on card means Magic clouds are fast in mountains). If the same tile was placed on a road in forest terrain it would require 2 Magic Cloud cards to travel that route (2 Forest symbols on card means Magic Clouds are slow in Forest).  Magic Clouds cannot travel in desert terrain at all (no desert symbols on card). All modes of transport are different and Rafts can be used on rivers or lakes without needing tiles. Rafts go slow upstream (2 raft cards needed) and fast downstream (1 card needed).  The small lake requires 1 raft card to travel across and the larger lake requires 2 cards to travel across.  Players may keep one unused transport counter and up to 4 Transportation cards from one round to the next.&#10;&#10;The second part of the round begins after all players have finished placing their transportation tiles for the round.  Each player plays his cards and moves his elf-boot around the board collecting his tokens from the cities visited.  If there is a Transport tile on a route and a player has no matching Transportation card he may 'Caravan' across it by playing any 3 Transportation cards from his hand.&#10;&#10;As a bit of 'take that' each player has a trouble tile which can be placed next to any transportation tile during the first part of the round.  This counter means that in order to travel that path an additional card of the transport type must be played or 4 cards to 'Caravan'.&#10;&#10;Victory: if at the end of round 3 a player has visited all 20 cities he is the winner.  If not the game ends after round 4 when 'Home' cities are revealed and each player subtracts points for each city he is away from his 'home' subtracting that from his collected city tokens.  The person with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.67199;2.1511
11;Bohnanza;"Bohnanza is the first in the Bohnanza family of games and has been published in several different editions, including a 2023 version with flowers.&#10;&#10;This entry lists a few different major card sets for Bohnanza: the base game for 3-5 players, the expanded game with the same name for 2-7 players (that is, first expansion included), and Bohnanza Pocket.&#10;&#10;In the game, you plant, then harvest bean cards in order to earn coins. Each player starts with a hand of random bean cards, and each card has a number on it corresponding to the number of that type of beans in the deck. Unlike in most other card games, you can't rearrange the order of cards in hand, so you must use them in the order that you've picked them up from the deck &mdash; unless you can trade them to other players, which is the heart of the game.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you must plant the first one or two cards in your hand into the &quot;fields&quot; in front of you. Each field can hold only one type of bean, so if you must plant a type of bean that's not in one of your fields, then you must harvest a field to make room for the new arrival. This usually isn't good! Next, you reveal two cards from the deck, and you can then trade these cards as well as any card in your hand for cards from other players. You can even make future promises for cards received right now! After all the trading is complete &mdash; and all trades on a turn must involve the active player &mdash; then you end your turn by drawing cards from the deck and placing them at the back of your hand.&#10;&#10;When you harvest beans, you receive coins based on the number of bean cards in that field and the &quot;beanometer&quot; for that particular type of bean. Flip over 1-4 cards from that field to transform them into coins, then place the remainder of the cards in the discard pile. When the deck runs out, shuffle the discards, playing through the deck two more times. At the end of the game, everyone can harvest their fields, then whoever has earned the most coins wins.&#10;&#10;The original German edition supports 3-5 players. The English version from Rio Grande Games comes with the first edition of the first German expansion included in a slightly oversized box. One difference in the contents, however, is that bean #22's Weinbrandbohne (Brandy Bean) was replaced by the Wachsbohne, or Wax Bean. This edition includes rules for up to seven players, like the Erweiterungs-Set, but also adapts the two-player rules of Al Cabohne in order to allow two people to play Bohnanza.&#10;&#10;";1997;7.0696;1.6677
12;Ra;"Ra is an auction and set-collection game with an Ancient Egyptian theme.  Each turn players are able to purchase lots of tiles with their bidding tiles (suns).  Once a player has used up his or her suns, the other players continue until they do likewise, which may set up a situation with a single uncontested player bidding on tiles before the end of the round occurs.  Tension builds because the round may end before all players have had a chance to win their three lots for the epoch.  The various tiles either give immediate points, prevent negative points for not having certain types at the end of the round (epoch), or give points after the final round.  The game lasts for three &quot;epochs&quot; (rounds).  The game is easy to learn.&#10;&#10;From the Box:&#10;The game spans 1500 years of Egyptian history in less than an hour!&#10;The players seek to expand their power and fame and there are many ways to accomplish this: Influencing Pharaohs, Building monuments, Farming on the Nile, Paying homage to the Gods, Advancing the technology and culture of the people. Ra is an auction and set collecting game where players may choose to take risks for great rewards or... And all this is for the glory of the Sun God Ra!&#10;&#10;";1999;7.66571;2.315
13;CATAN;"In CATAN (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine which resources the island produces. Players build structures by 'spending' resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) which are represented by the relevant resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore, fields produce wheat, and pastures produce sheep.&#10;&#10;Set-up includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each depicting one of the five resource-producing terrain types--or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. A number disk, the value of which will correspond to the roll of two 6-sided dice, are placed on each terrain tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are placed on intersections and borders of the terrain tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which terrain tiles their last-placed settlement is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of rolling the dice, collecting resource cards based on this dice roll and the position of settlements (or upgraded cities&mdash;think: hotels), turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, possibly playing a development card, or trading resource cards with other players. If the dice roll is a 7, the active player moves the robber to a new terrain tile and steals a resource card from another player who has a settlement adjacent to that tile.&#10;&#10;Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road or the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), s/he announces this and claims the win.&#10;&#10;";1995;7.09406;2.2874
14;Basari;"Basari is a game of gem merchants competing in a marketplace&quot;: racing, collecting, trading, and predicting what the other merchants will do.&#10;&#10;To start the game, players receive 12 gemstones (3 each of 4 colors). &#10;Each turn there will be a movement phase and an action phase:&#10;&#10;For movement, everyone simultaneously rolls their die and moves their markers around a track.&#10;&#10;They then choose one of three different actions to perform. The actions are:&#10;- to take a variety of gems from a market stall, &#10;- to immediately score from between 4 and 7 points, or &#10;- to roll and move again and also collect points.&#10;&#10;The action cards are revealed simultaneously. If only 1 player chose a particular action, they simply perform that action. If 2 players chose the same action, they barter back and forth with gemstones. One player will eventually accept the other's offer of gems, and the other will take the action. If 3 or 4 players all chose the same action card, that action is cancelled. Note that in 4-player games, there will always be a conflict in choice of 3 actions, so much more negotiating goes on.&#10;&#10;A new turn begins with everyone rolling their die, moving, then choosing and revealing their action cards. When any merchant piece completes a lap around the board, the round ends and bonus points are awarded based on who has the majority in each gem color and who has completed a lap. After three rounds, the game is over and the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Edel, Stein & Reich&#10;&#10;&#10;";1998;6.74684;1.8478
15;Cosmic Encounter;"By request of Fantasy Flight Games, Board Game Geek lists the various editions of Cosmic Encounter in separate entries. Each edition is the same game at its core, but the features, compatible expansions, and production differ among them. This entry is for the original 1977 Eon version.&#10;&#10;Players represent alien races that are seeking to spread themselves onto five foreign worlds.  To accomplish this, they make challenges against other players and enlist the aid of interested parties.  But alien powers, which are unique to each race, give players ways to bend or outright break some rule in the game.&#10;&#10;The game continues until one player occupies five planets in other systems to win. Shared victories are possible and a player need not occupy one's own system to win.&#10;&#10;";1977;6.92458;2.3721
16;MarraCash;"Taking on the roles of shop owners in the Moroccan marketplace, players buy various shops, as color-coded tourists in the form of neat little wooden people in hats start showing up at the entry gate. Players can then move them into their own like-colored shops to earn money or move them into opponents' shops for a share of the profits. After all the tourists have been placed onto the board, the player with the biggest bankroll takes the victory.

17;Button Men;"This game gained a quick following after one of the major gaming conventions of 1999.  It features several characters, represented on actual stickpin buttons, that each have a unique allowance of polyhedral dice.  These dice endow each  character with fairly unique combat abilities.  Players roll the dice against each other and take their opponents' dice as casualties.  The object of the game is take out the most die 'sides' during the combat.  It's quite simple, quite inventive, and deeper than it would seem at first.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.36282;1.52
18;RoboRally;"The robots of the RoboRally automobile factory spend their weekdays toiling at the assembly line. They put in hard hours building high-speed supercars they never get to see in action. But on Saturday nights, the factory becomes a world of mad machines and dangerous schemes as these robots engage in their own epic race.It takes speed, wits, and dirty tricks to become a racing legend! Each player chooses a robot and directs its moves by playing cards. Chaos ensues as all players reveal the cards they've chosen. Players face obstacles like industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyor belts -- but those can also be used to their advantage! Each player aims to make it to each of the checkpoints in numerical order. The first player to reach all of the checkpoints wins. &#10;&#10;In RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.&#10;&#10;In general, players will first fill all of their robot's &quot;registers&quot; with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it!&#10;&#10;Robots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style.&#10;&#10;The game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in 2005.&#10;&#10;UPC 742818050029&#10;&#10;";1994;7.05056;2.4285
19;Wacky Wacky West;"A long time ago, in a village far, far away, some disturbed townsfolk decided to destroy their entire town in order to rid themselves of an evil menace (it's technically a dog-mouse, but I think it's an idiomatic thing).  Anyway, so the villagers rebuilt all the buildings in the town (including their precious outhouses), but forgot to include city walls, a river, or roads.  To rectify this, players lay tiles with one of these three things onto the board, and any building caught underneath them is automatically eliminated, except for outhouses.  When an outhouse would be destroyed, players take a vote on whether to place that particular section.  Each player is trying to retain the most of one type of building, and once all the pieces have been placed the winner is the person with the highest valued buildings still standing.&#10;&#10;Wacky, Wacky West re-make description:&#10;&#10;Fans of Klaus Teuber will be interested in this remake/redesign of Drunter und Dr&uuml;ber, a 1991 Spiel des Jahres winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;Just south of nowhere, there's the junction of the Mayfair &amp; Rossdorf RR and the Turvy Trunk Line. Springing up from the desert like a tumbleweed lies the eccentric little town of Rossdorf. Like most western towns, Rossdorf has a Land Agent: Guy Dough, the brother of that wicked varmint Black Benny. A shrewd opportunist, Guy's done sold all the town land ('ceptin' the outhouses) four times over! Every acre in town that ain't got an outhouse on it is owned by the miners, the railroads, AND the fort captain. Just about a year ago, miners digging in the shadow of Fort Rossdorf struck the mother lode! But it wasn't gold, and it wasn't silver. No, my friend, it was just a little spring. Not any ordinary spring, though! It was a torrent of that mind-marbling drink the locals call &quot;Wacky Water!&quot; &#10;&#10;&#10;Now that water's done what the sun and the wind couldn't do: it's made those landholders brave enough to take matters into their own hands. Now they'll use whatever means they can to bowl over the competition and lay claim to the only fertile spots left in town! Now the only thing stoppin' 'em is the Town Charter Amendment #5, which states: &quot;no landholder may move, remove, or detonate any outhouse without a majority vote of the Town Citizens...&quot; Now one thing's for sure: something's gonna stink in Rossdorf, purty darn soon.....&#10;&#10;&#10;In Wacky Wacky West you and your fellow townfolk place track tiles, street tiles, and river tiles hoping to destroy your rivals' buildings. Every time someone tries to build over a precious outhouse, the town votes! You try to enlist your supporters (represented by cards) to vote with you to stop or encourage the play of certain tiles-perhaps saving some of your buildings or taking out those of your dastardly opponents.&#10;&#10;";1991;6.27644;1.8204
20;Full Metal PlanÃ¨te;"In this game of science fiction strip mining, players land on a planet and try and grab as much ore as possible and take off before the game is over.  Each player has tanks, boats, barges, mining equipment and a base ship at his disposal and will have to contend with the weather and the other miners.  The game uses an action point allowance system and thus is dice free.  Each player on his turn has a pool of points that he can divide in a variety of ways, putting all the points into one unit's movement or dividing them among several units.  Each turn is timed so players have to think quickly, and once a move has been made it cannot be retracted.  The game itself is beautifully put together, with a detailed hex grid and real metal miniatures for all of the units.&#10;&#10;Online Play: &#10;&#10;    Full Metal Galaxy&#10;    Full Metal Program&#10;    VASSAL module&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Full Metal Conqu&#195;&#170;te (as a two-player version)&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Full Metal Planete: Plateau Modulaire.&#10;&#10;&#10;Microbadges:&#10; - Full Metal Plan&egrave;te fan  Buy It&#10;&#10;";1988;7.50139;3.1429

22;Magic Realm;"From the 2nd edition rulebook intro for MAGIC REALM:&#10;&#10;MAGIC REALM is a game of fantasy adventuring, set in a land filled with monsters, fabulous treasures, great warriors, and magicians. The scene is set in the ruins of a mighty kingdom, now inhabited by sparse groups of natives and swarms of monsters. Beneath it all are the rich remnants of a magical civilization, scattered and lost across the map.&#10;To this scene come the adventurers, seekers of riches and fame, to make a name for themselves in this promising field. Swordsman and Dwarf, Magician and Sorceror, the humans and the half-humans come seeking to loot the legendary riches of a lost civilization. Now you can play the part of one of these adventurers, stepping into an unknown Realm of magic and monsters, battles and treasures.&#10;&#10;As a player, you will take on the role of one of the sixteen major characters who are represented in detail in the game. You will control where he goes, what he tries to do, how he handles himself in combat, and much more. In the course of the game, you will run into deadly monsters, tribes of humans ranging from old friends to sworn enemies, and treasures that will enhance your abilities in many ways.&#10;&#10;MAGIC REALM is a complex game designed to recapture the suspense and desperate struggles of fantasy literature. The game creates a small but complete fantasy world, where each game is a new adventure with a new map where everything lies hidden at new locations. The game includes many more playing pieces than are actually used in a single playing. The additional pieces are set up and can appear, depending on the directions in which the characters explore, but many of the treasure troves, treasures, and spells will still be set up, unfound, when the game ends, and many of the monsters and natives might never be met. The result is an extremely unpredictable game full of surprises, a game that plays very differently each time it is played.&#10;The complete game system includes hiking, hiding and searching, fatigue, wounds, rest, trade, hiring natives, and combat between characters, monsters, and natives using a variety of weapons on horseback and afoot, as well as many magical effects.&#10;&#10;Between exploring a new land where the mountains, caves, valleys, and woods change every game, and not knowing what you will find in each place, you will find each game a new and unpredictable adventure, filled with surprises. You will find this like no other board game you have ever played.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 9&#10;&#10;See also the list of articles about Magic Realm in The General.&#10;&#10;";1979;7.29881;4.562
23;Divine Right;"Divine Right combines combat, diplomacy, and role-playing into 2-6 hours of fast-paced action as each player attempts to build and hold together an alliance of kings long enough to defeat the other players and win the game. The kingdoms of humans, elves, goblins, dwarves and trolls are pawns in the power games that absolute monarchs play. Ambassadors vie for the attention of the kings whose favor they curry. Assassination and backstabbing are popular pastimes, and loyal allies may leave your side in the heat of battle at the drop of a hat &mdash; or a die. The magicians, too, get their arcane fingers into things, and the gods intervene as well. It is a situation that demands skill and luck.&#10;&#10;The box contains rule book, full-color mapsheet, over 250 die-cut counters, dice, and cards.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Divine Right: Scarlet Empire&#10;&#10;&#10;";1979;7.20338;3.1688
24;Twilight Imperium;"Sprawling game of space faring races out to dominate known space.&#10;&#10;This game combines a number of elements from other game systems into a unique package. Hex tiles create the game board and each player begins with a race with unique powers. The game focuses heavily on a political voting phase and a web of trade agreements between players.&#10;&#10;&#10;Part of the Twilight Imperium Series / Family.&#10;&#10;Expanded with:&#10;&#10;    Twilight Imperium: Borderlands&#10;    Twilight Imperium: Distant Suns&#10;    Twilight Imperium: Twilight Armada&#10;    Twilight Imperium: The Outer Rim&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented in:&#10;&#10;    Twilight Imperium: Second Edition&#10;    Twilight Imperium: Third Edition&#10;    Twilight Imperium (Fourth Edition)&#10;&#10;&#10;";1997;6.59199;3.4643

A card driven system resolves players' quests.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Battlemist: The Sails of War&#10;&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;    Runewars&#10;&#10;&#10;";1998;5.89138;3.2
26;Age of Renaissance;"A game that is often described as a semi-sequel to Civilization.&#10;&#10;Players attempt to build up their cultures during the Middle Ages and Renaissance periods. The game features a card deck that holds events, payout cards, and famous leaders of the particular eras. Although all cards will turn up somewhere during the game, the timing and position in which they will be played is crucial and will ensure a different game every time.&#10;&#10;The main goal of each city-state is to gain points in the form of technical advances, while keeping their culture's misery level as low as possible. The payout structure is similar to those of Civilization and Advanced Civilization in that more resources of the same type yield increasingly higher payouts. This time particular payouts are triggered by card play for every player at once. An ingenious and very smooth working &ldquo;combat&rdquo; system is implemented to determine province &ndash; and thus resource - control.&#10;&#10;";1996;7.09318;3.8495

30;Dark Tower;"An epic fantasy quest to recover an ancient magic scepter from a tyrant king in his Dark Tower, brought to life in electronic form.&#10;&#10;To vanquish the usurper, players search the four realms of the circular game board for three keys to unlock the tower's gate.  On this journey, there are battles to be fought against roving bands of brigands, dragons, plague and hunger.  There are bazaars to visit to purchase supplies and assistants for the quest.  There are uncharted territories to get lost in and tombs and ruins to plunder.  And there is a mighty army to be raised before the player can lay siege to the tower and fight either to glorious victory or crushing defeat.&#10;&#10;Dark Tower was technologically impressive when it was released in 1981.  Gameplay was facilitated by a small computer inside the black plastic shell of the tower itself.  Players input their moves on a small membrane keypad each turn and the computer took over from there, doing everything from conducting the progress of battles to keeping track of how much (or little) food was left to feed the players' always hungry warriors. The computer would play brief musical serenades at significant points of the game.&#10;&#10;";1981;6.88774;1.802
31;Dark World;"Along the lines of HeroQuest comes a much more heavily produced game called Dark World.

36;Federation & Empire;"This sprawling empire game is set in the  Star Fleet Universe. Players command one or more races in a variety of scenarios as they replay the &quot;historical&quot; situations in the galactic politics of the future.&#10;&#10;It is the base set for the Federation and Empire series of products.&#10;&#10;The Star Fleet Universe series is based on the game Star Fleet Battles, and Federation &amp; Empire is a strategic game based in that background.  Federation &amp; Empire is a stand alone game, and Star Fleet Battles is not required or needed to play this game.&#10;&#10;The two games are closely related, and Star Fleet Battles can be used to resolve some or all of the tactical battles of Federation &amp; Empire, and Federation &amp; Empire can be used as a campaign system for Star Fleet Battles.&#10;&#10;The original version came out in 1986, and was published by Task Force Games.  This was followed in 1990 with the &quot;Deluxe&quot; version, which replaced the original release.  &quot;Deluxe&quot; was indicated on the front of the box to indicate it was the new version.  The Deluxe version included a revised rule book, more counter sheets, and other player aids such as the battle board and player folio.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Deluxe&quot; version had three expansions:&#10;&#10;    Federation & Empire: Carrier War&#10;    Federation & Empire: F & E Module 1 &#226;&#128;&#147; Special Operations&#10;    Federation & Empire: F & E Module 2 &#226;&#128;&#147; Marine Assault&#10;&#10;&#10;In 2000, another revision of the rules was completed, and the F&amp;E 2K (as it is called) version stood for a decade.&#10;&#10;In 2010 the countersheets were entirely redone (with a larger number of counters per sheet) and the rulebook was once again revised to incorporate the last 10 years of errata and rulings, allowing a better integration with the expansions that were released during this period.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Federation & Empire: Advanced Operations&#10;    Federation & Empire: Combined Operations (combined and replaced Federation & Empire: F & E Module 1 &#226;&#128;&#147; Special Operations and Federation & Empire: F & E Module 2 &#226;&#128;&#147; Marine Assault)&#10;    Federation & Empire: Fighter Operations (replaced Federation & Empire: Carrier War)&#10;    Federation & Empire: Planetary Operations&#10;    Federation & Empire: Strategic Operations&#10;    Federation & Empire: ISC War&#10;    Federation & Empire: Minor Empires&#10;&#10;&#10;Since 2010 ADB has created, in both print and pdf form, Compendium I, II and III.

38;Runes;"Runes is a different kind of word game where players actually construct the letters with special game pieces.  Players attempt to figure out not simply the spelling but the actual letter structure of the hidden words.&#10;&#10;Players take turns putting one letter segment in a letter box on another player's board; they get a point if the segment belongs to that letter and the other player gets a point if it doesn't. When a player thinks they know an opponent's word they guess it and gain points equal to the number of segments in the word (or lose the points if they are incorrect).&#10;&#10;";1981;6.13689;1.9
39;Darkover;"Based on the books of Marion Zimmer Bradley this game melds your typical strategy game with what would normally be found in a party game.

41;Can't Stop;"In this Sid Sackson classic, players must press their luck with dice and choose combinations tactically to close out three columns. The board has one column for each possible total of two six-sided dice, but the number of spaces in each column varies: the more probable a total, the more spaces in that column and the more rolls it takes to complete. On their turn, a player rolls four dice and arranges them in duos: 1 4 5 6 can become 1+4 and 5+6 for 5 &amp; 11, 1+5 and 4+6 for 6 &amp; 10, or 1+6 and 4+5 for 7 &amp; 9. The player places or advances progress markers in the open column(s) associated with their chosen totals, then chooses whether to roll again or end their turn and replace the progress markers with markers of their color. A player can only advance three different columns in a turn and cannot advance a column which any player has closed out by reaching the end space; if a roll doesn&rsquo;t result in any legal plays, the turn ends with that turn&rsquo;s progress lost.&#10;&#10;A predecessor from 1974, The Great Races, exists as a paper-and-pencil game.&#10;&#10;";1980;6.92604;1.144
42;Tigris & Euphrates;"Regarded by many as Reiner Knizia's masterpiece, Tigris &amp; Euphrates is set in the ancient fertile crescent with players building civilizations through tile placement. Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized. Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board, i.e., external conflicts, with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict. Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts.&#10;&#10;Starting in the Mayfair edition from 2008, Tigris &amp; Euphrates included a double-sided game board and extra components for playing an advanced version of the game. This &quot;ziggurat expansion&quot;, initially released as a separate item in Germany for those who already owned the base game, is a special monument that extends across five spaces of the board. The monument can be built if a player has a cross of five civilization tokens of the same color by discarding those five tokens and replacing them with the ziggurat markers, placing a ziggurat tower upon the middle tile. The five ziggurat markers cannot be destroyed. All rules regarding monuments apply to the ziggurat monument as well. If your king is inside the kingdom of the ziggurat, you will get one victory point in a color of your choice at the end of your turn.&#10;&#10;Some versions of Tigris &amp; Euphrates are listed as being for 2-4 players, while others incorrectly state that they're for 3-4 players. Tigris &amp; Euphrates is part of what is sometimes called Reiner Knizia's tile-laying trilogy.&#10;&#10;";1997;7.70246;3.4959
43;Airlines;"Airlines' theme is exactly as suggested by the title. The game is similar to the Sid Sackson classic, Acquire, in that players are competing to become majority stockholders in several highly-abstracted companies with the player owning the most valuable portfolio at the end being the winner.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player chooses from one of two actions: expand an airline and put stock into his hand, or play stock from his hand. Expanding an airline adds to its route(s) on the board and increases its value but the trick is that when a scoring card shows up (randomly), only played stock counts as a player's holdings.&#10;&#10;";1990;6.57678;2.4242
44;David & Goliath;"This game adds a very interesting twist to the standard trick-taking genre.  There are five suits and players must follow suit, if they can.  However, the winner of the trick is the highest card played, regardless of suit.  The winner gets all the cards from the trick, minus the card he won it with.  That card is given to the player that played the lowest card.  After all tricks have been played, the scoring begins.  Players score the face-value of the cards in the suits that they only collected one or two of, and one point per card for suits with more than two.  The player with the most points after a number of hands wins the game.&#10;&#10;";1997;6.49205;1.623
45;Perudo;"Liar's Dice, a.k.a. Bluff, Perudo or Dudo, is a South American dice game in which each player is given five dice and cup to roll and hide them with. Players make successively higher declarations regarding the results of all the dice remaining in the game, e.g. &quot;there are ten sixes&quot;. However, someone can always contest the bid. When that happens, all the dice are revealed and either the bidder or the caller loses dice, depending on who was correct. The last player with dice is the winner.&#10;&#10;As a public domain dice game, there are a number of variants or similar games called Liar's Dice. This includes one that is often played with Poker Dice, and differs from the marketed versions in that players only declare on their own hand's value (as opposed to all dice being in play), using poker-hand values.&#10;&#10;";1800;6.92292;1.2518
46;Medici;"Another Reiner Knizia standby, this game plays very well with varying numbers of people.  The object is to accrue the most points during three rounds, which you do by spending your points to bid on sets of cards.  Each turn the current player turns up one to three cards for all the players to bid on, with the highest bid taking all cards.  The cards denote a commodity type and quantity/value.  The round ends when each player's ships are full, or the commodity card deck is exhausted.  After each round, points are awarded to each player having the most of a given commodity, and to the one with the most valuable total &quot;cargo load&quot;.&#10;&#10;Part of the Knizia auction trilogy.&#10;One of the Knizia Florentine auction games.&#10;&#10; Related Games: &#10;&#10;&#10;     Medici vs Strozzi (two-player version)&#10;     Strozzi&#10;     Mercator, included in Neue Spiele im alten Rom (ancestor to Medici).&#10;&#10;&#10;";1995;7.18278;2.2212
47;Chinatown;"This is a negotiation game in the truest sense of the word. In it, players acquire ownership of sections of city blocks then place tiles, representing businesses, onto the block-sections.  At the end of each turn, each tile you've laid gives you some sort of payout, but completed businesses (formed of three to six connected tiles of the same type) pay quite a bit better.  All these resources are dealt to the players randomly, however, so players must trade to get matching businesses and adjacent locations.&#10;&#10;This game is #2 in the Alea big box series.&#10;&#10;";1999;7.4374;2.2359
48;Krieg und Frieden;"Taking on the roles of land-owners in a feudal society, players are charged with running their lands and accruing favor from the bishop by building his cathedral.  Each turn, players use their resources to bid for that year's agenda, and some resources have more or less value in the bid depending on what type of agenda is available.  Then players use their remaining resources to build their lands, sack others' lands, bribe others' knights away from defense, or help to build the bishop's cathedral.  Finally, players harvest new resources for the next turn.  After all the pieces of the cathedral have been built, the game is over with the victory going to the player with the most victory points.  This game was originally released as Charlemagne by Think Games at Essen 1998, and later slightly shortened as Krieg und Frieden.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Charlemagne&#10;&#10;&#10;";1999;6.09079;2.4638
49;Mamma Mia!;"Designer Uwe Rosenberg has a talent for dreaming up new and inventive card games, and Mamma Mia! is a perfect example of this talent, with players placing pizza ingredients into a combined pool, then trying to time their pizza baking in order to make use of what's available in the kitchen.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with eight different pizza orders to fill, with one of those order cards in hand; each player also starts with a hand of ingredient cards (showing pepperoni, mushroom, pineapple, green pepper or olive). On a turn, a player lays down one or more ingredient cards of a single type into a common stack, then optionally adds a pizza order card to that stack. He then refills his hand by drawing as many cards as he played from either the shared ingredient deck or his own order deck.&#10;&#10;After the draw pile is exhausted, the shared pile of cards is flipped over and sorted by ingredients until an order comes up. If enough ingredient cards are available to fill that order, the owner scores it; if not, the player can make up the difference by playing cards from his hand (and thereby scoring the order) or else return the card to the bottom of his order deck.&#10;&#10;Once all the orders are scored or returned, shuffle the ingredients used in pizzas and start another round of play. After three complete rounds, the player who's filled the most orders wins!&#10;&#10;";1998;6.48067;1.362
50;Lost Cities;"Lost Cities is a card game in the Kosmos two-player series. The game originally consisted of a single deck of cards of rank 2&ndash;10 in five different colors with three special &quot;handshakes&quot; (&quot;HS&quot; in scoring examples below) in each suit, but as of 2018 the game now includes six colored suits, with the sixth color being optional for gameplay. A game board is included to organize discarded cards and help players organize their card collections.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the colored suits of cards. On a player's turn, they must first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the color-appropriate discard pile, then draw one card, either from the deck or from the top of a discard pile. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order, but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.&#10;&#10;The game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the deck. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total; one handshake doubles an expedition's value, while two handshakes triples that value and three handshakes quadruple it. Expeditions start at a value of -20, so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least eight cards played into it. A complete game of Lost Cities lasts three matches, with scores for each match being added together.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 1: An expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30. This expedition is worth 10 total points: 30 plus the initial -20.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 2: An expedition has 2 HS, and 4,5,6,7,8,10 for a total of 40. This expedition is worth 80 total points: 40 points for cards, plus the initial -20, &times;3 for the two multipliers, plus the 20-pt bonus for playing 8+ cards.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 3: An expedition has 1 HS, and 4,6,7 for a total of 17. This expedition is worth -6 total points: 17 plus the initial -20, &times;2 for the multiplier.&#10;&#10;";1999;7.24944;1.476
51;Ricochet Robots;"Ricochet Robots is less of a game and more of a puzzle, which explains why there's such an odd number of solutions possible. There's a four-piece modular board that forms a large room with walls spread around the board. There are also color-coded targets on boards. Placed on top of the surface are four robots. The idea for each turn/puzzle is to get the like-colored robot to a randomly selected target. The trick is that once a robot starts moving, it will continue to move until a wall or another robot stops it. Therefore, players are seeking a sequence of moves for the robots that will enable them to move the required robot to the target in the fewest moves.&#10;&#10;";1999;7.03407;2.3801
52;Mighty Empires;"Mighty Empires is both a strategic layer to the Warhammer Fantasy Battle (Third Edition) system and a boardgame in its own right.  It allows players of the miniature game to manage a kingdom, explore the world, and attempt to conquer other kingdoms, but it also can be played standalone as a fantasy wargame.  The game board is constructed with hexagonal tiles to create a unique land with mountains, hills, river valleys, lowlands, and coastal areas.

58;Kings & Things;"Kings &amp; Things is a classic Tom Wham game of warring kingdoms in a fantasy world and the legions of things that inhabit them.

59;Giganten;"Besides attempting to find oil in dusty Texas, players must also try to outbid one another for sales contracts in the oil industry.  An oilfield with drilling sites scattered about is spread out before the players, who take their trucks out trying to grab those sites as quickly as possible.&#10;&#10;Three groups of tiles are laid over the drilling sites, giving a range of value for each site once it has been reached by a player.  The deeper a site is into the field the greater its overall yield. But players have to weigh this against creating a constant supply from the smaller yields that are closer at the beginning of the game.&#10;&#10;Once oil has been produced, players can attempt to sell it on the market. But there are only three companies, and with four players this means that one player will be shut out each turn.  Bidding has an interesting element to it in that player's bidding pools are hidden from one another, making it difficult to tell whether a player is bluffing.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented as Black Gold&#10;&#10;";1999;6.69443;2.5693
61;Fossil;"On the hunt for petrified treasures, players are competing paleontologists trying to make as complete a set as possible of several fossils.  The board is laid out with a random bunch of fossil pieces and players have to take turns moving a stone about the field to a location where they want to pick up a fossil piece.  However, every movement costs them prestige points so they have to weigh carefully if the fossil is worth the effort.&#10;&#10;Won Games Magazine Game of the Year award in 1999.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.42226;1.75
63;Samurai: Game of Politics and Warfare in Feudal Japan;"(from the back of the box:)&#10;&#10;You are now back in time-12th through 17th century Japan, to be exact. Your objective: the exalted title of &quot;Shogun&quot;. As &quot;Shogun&quot;, you will have the right to enforce the emperor's will, and become the real ruler of Japan.&#10;&#10;Samurai allows you to take control of Japan. In medieval Japan, the central government of the emperor was dissolved. He become a powerless figurehead while various clans competed to take control of the country. &#10;These clans were similar to the noble houses of Europe; and their leaders the equivalent of medieval Dukes, Barons, Counts, and the like. &#10;Using formldable samurai warriors, the clans waged endless wars across the major islands of the Japanese archipelago.&#10;&#10;Concept of Play &#10;Each player controls a clan, with one or more lords. Each lord has a province representing his personal &quot;fief&quot; or home, and often has additional holdings of troops, titles, ships, castles, and more provinces.&#10;&#10;The game is played in 20 turns, each representing a pace of historical events running between a few months to a few years. In each turn, moves are conducted on a mapboard that portrays the three major islands of Japan.&#10;&#10;The playing pieces-360 in all-include Samurai Lords, clan control markers, holdings and title counters, troops, garrisons, and more; all explained in the easy&shy; to-follow prose of the 18-page rules folder.&#10;&#10;Many Games in One &#10;An excellent game for 2 to 8 players. Samurai is suitable for beginning and intermedlate play, with plenty of optional rules and strategic options for even the expert. And for the really hard-core power-politics fanatics, special rules create a nearly &quot;perpetual&quot; game representing tho true ebb and flow of Japanese feudal confilct. &#10;Samurai includes a variety of playing aids to make learning and playing the game truly an effortless task. The rules manual contains historical background and designer's notes that offer the player the full flavor and authenticity of what medieval conflict was all about in the age of the &quot;Shogun&quot; struggles.&#10;&#10;&#10;(BGG description:)&#10;&#10;Samurai is a game about warfare and politics in feudal Japan.

These are: the Emperor, The Heir, The Imperial Regalia and Kyoto Castle.&#10;&#10;Playing pieces are the samurai lords of various houses. Each lord has a home province which provides him with troops.

67;Conquest;"Conquest was designed to be a diceless wargame.  Its latest version updates the original with plastic units and a colorful map.  Set in ancient times, Conquest has players utilizing troops, cavalry, chariots, elephants and ships to try to capture their opponents' fortifications or occupy the &quot;quest&quot; locations.  The map is designed for point-to-point movement, and play hinges on a pool of action points that each side uses to move its different units.  Conquest comes in two versions, one designed for four players and one designed exclusively for two.&#10;&#10;";1974;6.41337;2.4706

Sounds easy, right?&#10;&#10;Rule One: Black plays first. Still sounds easy? Not so fast!&#10;&#10;Rule Two: The seemingly sudden 'Sandwich Move'. Just like it sounds, when you entrap two of your opponent's pieces between two of your own, you get to &quot;evict&quot; one of your opponent's pieces. This 'Sandwich Move' really does &quot;bollox up&quot; the game plan of the unwary player. Often the Sandwich Move can completely turn the game around and give you a dazzling win.&#10;&#10;1999 Mensa Select&#10;&#10;";1999;6.746;2.4
71;Civilization;"Civilization is a game of skill for 2 to 7 players. It covers the development of ancient civilizations from the invention of agriculture c. 8000 B.C. to the emergence of Rome around the middle of the third century B.C. Each player leads a nation of peoples over a map board of the Eastern Mediterranean and Near East as they attempt to carve a niche for themselves and their culture.&#10;&#10;Although battles and territorial strategy are important, this is not a war game because it is not won by battle or conquest. Instead, the object of play is to gain a level of overall advancement involving cultural, economic, and political factors so that such conflicts that do arise are a result of rivalry and land shortage rather than a desire to eliminate other players. Nomad and farmer, warrior and merchant, artisan and citizen all have an essential part to play in the development of civilization. It is the player who most effectively changes emphasis between these various outlooks who will achieve the best balance and win.&#10;&#10;(from the Introduction to the Avalon Hill edition rulebook)&#10;&#10;This game has a huge following and is widely regarded as one of the best games about ancient civilizations. Each player takes on the role of leader of an ancient civilization, such as the Illyrians or Babylonians. Your task is to guide your people through the ages by expanding your empire and using its proceeds to finance new technological advances, such as Literacy, Metalworking, or Law. The advancements help your civilization better cope with its problems as well as help bring new advancements.&#10;&#10;Civilization is widely thought to be the first game ever to incorporate a &quot;technology tree,&quot; allowing players to gain certain items and abilities only after particular other items were obtained. This influential mechanism has been adopted by countless other board games, card games, and computer games.&#10;&#10;";1980;7.49217;3.6435
73;Show Manager;"The players put together four shows in any order.  To accomplish this, players draft actor cards from a constantly changing queue of cards.  Each card represents actors of varying skills at roles.  Once a player puts together all the needed roles for a show, the value is judged against all the other productions of that type, with points given relative to the other productions.&#10;&#10;This is a Queen Games reprint of the db-Spiele original, Premiere.&#10;&#10;";1996;6.9808;2.0938
75;Falling;"This game is from an odd genre, real-time card games.  Each of the players (except the dealer) is a person falling to his death.  The goal is not to live, rather just to be the last one to go splat.  The dealer continues dealing cards to players, eventually giving them 'ground' cards.  But on the way down players can do all kinds of nasty stuff to each other to ensure their relative longevity.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.50551;1.218
77;EastFront: The War in Russia, 1941-45;"EastFront details the conflict between Germany and the Soviet Union during WWII.  Players have to contend with production, supply, command control and whether to try and break the other side's lines.  Several scenarios cover every major point of the war.  The game comes with a fantastic, detailed map of Eastern Europe and Russia printed on cardstock and many wooden blocks for the units.  This is a stand alone game that can also serve as one element of the complete EuroFront series which covers the entire European conflict of WWII.&#10;&#10;This title uses the Columbia Games Block system.  While there are variations in the rule sets, all of the &quot;Front&quot; series of games are based on the block system.  Basically this means that rather than using traditional counters to represent units on the map the game uses wooden blocks that stand upright with unit details only shown on one side.  This accomplishes two things:  First it provides an easy way of producing a &quot;fog of war&quot; because your opponent cannot tell, save through good memory or deduction, what type of unit a specific piece is or its current strength.  Second, having the blocks stand on end allows the possibility of rotating a block so the current strength is the top number.  Although most war games have some type of mechanism that allows units to take losses in steps of their overall strength, counters normally have at most two steps because they only have two sides.  Blocks, however, have four so you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide.&#10;&#10;With the use of blocks, Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding complex layers of bookkeeping, allowing interesting and relatively short sessions of play.&#10;&#10;";1991;7.67256;3.6

In over four years of titanic struggle, the ancient Europe of Kings and Emperors tore itself to pieces, giving birth to our own violent modern age. The bloody battles fought in the trenches of the Western Front, the icy plains of Poland, the mountains of the Balkans, and the deserts of Arabia, shaped the world we know today.

As the Central Powers you must use the advantage of interior lines and the fighting skill of the Imperial German Army to win your rightful 'place in the sun.' As the Entente Powers (Allies) you must bring your greater numbers to bear to put an end to German militarism and ensure this is the war 'to end all wars.'

Not only is the game innovative, but it also plays fast, usually within just an evening.&#10;&#10;While the game itself has all of the normal expectations of a wargame, with various units, CRT charts and period chrome, at heart the game rests within the card play.  Players are given a hand of cards to play out six sub-phases of a turn.  Each sub-phase allows for the use of a card or a pass with a minimal movement of units.  Each card has four possible uses: operational movement, strategic movement, special events, and replacement points.  The cardplay forces players to constantly make tough decsions as they feel that they need to do a little bit of everything but they can only do one thing at a time.  How you play your cards will decide to a large degree the outcome of the war.&#10;&#10;";1999;8.07765;3.854
93;El Grande;"In this award-winning game, players take on the roles of Grandes in medieval Spain.  The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions.  To that end, you draft caballeros (knights) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions.  After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).&#10;&#10;A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards vary from round to round.&#10;&#10;The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had there into the region you secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande and in the region containing the king.&#10;&#10;";1995;7.76382;2.9438

During a turn, you roll a die, optionally move any of your hedgehogs one row left or right, then move any hedgehog (not necessarily yours!) in the row your rolled forward one space.  But watch out for black spaces; hedgehogs caught there can't continue moving until they're in last place.  The first player to get three of their four hedgehogs to the end of the board wins.

97;Conquest of the Empire;"Conquest of the Empire is part of Milton Bradley&#039;s Gamemaster series.  It is set during the Roman Empire and depicts the struggle around the Mediterranean as rival factions attempt to take control of the empire.  Each player plays one of these factions and receives a Caesar figure, several general figures, and ships of a specific color.  Along with these leaders, players utilize a pool of generic units composed of infantry, cavalry, and catapults.  All game pieces are plastic figures.&#10;&#10;Players attempt to conquer their neighbors and build up cities and fortifications to increase production of wealth.  Players also may build road networks that allow for faster movement, by all armies.  Along the way players have to contend with rising inflation which makes military units more and more expensive.

From the west arrives hordes of Asian foes; from the south arrives a union of South American countries through Mexico, and from the east lands come legions of Soviets who have taken over all of Europe. America besieged has to rely on the remaining ground and air forces left in the country along with partisan uprisings to defend mom's apple pie.&#10;&#10;Up to four players can play Fortress America, one player being the U.S. and up to three others controlling the invading units from a particular direction. Being a near future scenario, the units in the game include conventional infantry, APCs, hovertanks, helicopters, bombers, US partisan units, and special &quot;Star Wars&quot; laser relay systems that fire from space.&#10;&#10;The game emphasizes combined arms in that players receive a bonus if infantry, mechanized, and air power are all used in a conflict. For the invading countries, all the units they receive for the game are given at the start so they must manage them wisely. The U.S., however, starts with a skeleton defense and builds up throughout the game through a random deck of cards. Further, the U.S. slowly builds up its Star Wars system, so the longer the invaders are delayed, the more powerful the U.S. becomes both conventionally and through its defense system.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Fortress America (2012)&#10;&#10;&#10;";1986;6.72253;2.6305
101;Detroit-Cleveland Grand Prix;"This game is part of a family which includes Top Race, Daytona 500, and Formel 1.  Players are dealt a hand of cards which have movement numbers for one or more of the cars.  When a card is played, the cars are advanced the number of spaces indicated in order from top to bottom.  However, if the track is blocked, then that movement is lost, so the idea is to use the cards that help your opponents (which you'll likely have to play eventually) only when they won't be able to take advantage of the movement.&#10;&#10;";1996;6.77672;1.713
103;Titan;"This classic game of the Fantasy Monster Slug-a-thon is a standby from the The Avalon Hill Game Co of yore.  The game still has a very devoted following, which is a tribute to the depth of the various strategies and approaches.  The game is divided into two realms, the masterboard and the battleboards.  On the masterboard, legions of mythical creatures roam about trying to recruit bigger and badder monsters and kill opposing legions in the process.  When a combat occurs, the action moves to the corresponding battleboard type corresponding to the area the fight is taking place in.  After lots of dice are tossed, the army that remains standing is returned to the masterboard with the spoils of war: points.&#10;&#10;The points are used to recruit Angels and Archangels and to augment the leader character of the player's army: The Titan.  As the points increase, the Titans become ever more powerful; at game end, the titan is able to kill most other character with a single blow. But be careful: If the Titan dies, the player is out of the game.&#10;&#10;The last Titan standing is the ruler of all, and winner of the game.&#10;&#10;";1980;6.96394;3.4642
105;Colossal Arena;"Colossal Arena/Titan:The Arena is a strategic card game for 2 to 5 players: you play, not as combatants, but as spectators, cheering and betting on the melee ongoing in a fantasy arena/colosseum in which fantasy creatures are pitted against each other in battle!&#10;&#10;Each round one of the creatures will die. To decide which unlucky soul will be the victim, players put numbered power cards in front of the creatures, with the lowest one going to the graveyard.  The jockeying for position and strategic diplomacy in playing the numbered power cards can be intense - but what makes this game even more interesting is that the players' place bets throughout the game which will sometimes allow them to use a creature's special power in battle!&#10;&#10;The winner at the end of the game is the bettor who's raked in the most winnings - just another day in the life of a fantasy monster gambler.&#10;&#10;Titan: The Arena is actually a reworking of a Reiner Knizia game called Grand National Derby, but The Avalon Hill Game Co's remake was quite significant from a gameplay standpoint.&#10;&#10;The Titan: The Arena printing is often confused with its namesake, Titan.  But other than the fact that they both use fantasy creatures as a general theme, there is very little that is similar between the two.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by: Galaxy: The Dark Ages&#10;&#10;";1997;6.75872;2.0203
107;Peaceful Resistance;"This small-publisher game comes with loads of wooden hex-shaped tiles, a hex board, and three pawns.  The object of the game is to move your pawn from one corner of the hex board to the opposite corner.  However, instead of taking your move, you can place a hex tile on the board.  These are used to block your opponent, because while your pawn can always go down any number of hex tiles, it can only step up one level at a time.&#10;&#10;";1995;5.72353;1.0
109;Wettstreit der Baumeister;"Jean du Po&#195;&#171;l put this game out on the market for about a year before the game's name was changed to Wettstreit der Baumeister in 1998.&#10;&#10;This translates to &quot;Contest of the Architects&quot;. The game has a beautiful assortment of large, thick tiles to represent the cities. Players bid on a single building tile every turn, with half the proceeds going to the auctioning player. When a player is ready to start construction of his city, the tiles are laid out in order with the single restriction that not two touching tiles are the same type. The building types are city halls, churches, towers, and gates. When the one of the two draw piles is exhausted, the cities are judged for symmetry, with the highest scoring city winning.&#10;&#10;Rules apply to either game:&#10;&#10;Within two decks of 20 cards are contained the City Wall, Towers and Gates, Churches, City Halls, etc. During play, one of the decks lies face up, the other face down. There are three parts to each player's turn. First, the player rolls a die in an attempt to better his finances (1 to 5 on the die; the sixth side gives a sabotage-counter instead). Second, he alone may look at the top hidden card before he makes an offer on either of the two top cards from the two decks. The other players then bid on the two cards. If the player (the Auctioneer) makes the highest bid, he may take the card and pay the bank. If, on the other hand, one of the other players buys the card, that player pays half the money to the bank and half to the Auctioneer. Third, a player may either build (lay down another card on his city) or sabotage a City Card of another player. The player receiving the sabotage must then pay the value of the card or remove it.&#10;&#10;The game ends when either of the decks is depleted.&#10;&#10;";1994;6.11169;1.9643
111;RheinlÃ¤nder;"This Reiner Knizia game, produced by Hasbro&#039;s European division, casts players in the roles of dukes who are trying to establish duchies along the banks of the Rhine River.  Players hold a hand of cards that correspond to numbered plots on each bank, and they place knights in open plots for which they hold the corresponding cards.  After establishing duchies, players attempt to expand them to include more plots of land, as well as buildings - such as castles, cathedrals, and cities. These buildings both add to the value of a duchy and provide their owners with advantages during game play.  Combined with a uniquely Knizia-style scoring system, this game has some very interesting dynamics.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.65568;2.3139
113;Plotters, Inc.;"Plotters, Inc., first released as Mit List und T&uuml;cke (&quot;With Cunning and Treachery&quot;), is a trick-taking game with quite a few twists. The deck consists of cards in four suits, and the deck is adjusted based on the player count so that everyone receives a hand of 14 cards to begin a round. At the start of a trick, the lead player plays any card, setting trump for that trick. Each other player plays any card that they like &mdash; except that once three colors of cards have been played, the fourth color cannot be played. Whoever plays the highest trump card wins the trick and collects two of the cards played (or three cards in a game with five or six players), placing these cards in front of them. Whoever plays the lowest non-trump card collects the remaining cards; this player leads to the next trick.&#10;&#10;Once a player has cards of all four colors in front of them, they must choose two colors and leave cards of this color face up, placing all other cards face down. As they collect more cards, they place them face up or face down based on their colors. The round ends after 14 tricks or when a player would be forced to play a card of the fourth color to a trick; in this latter case, the round ends immediately. Each player then scores the cards they've collected. For their two face-up colors, they multiply these numbers together; they then divide this product by the number of cards that they placed face down, rounding this number down. For example, if you have 6 yellow cards, 4 red cards, and 2 blue cards, then you have (6 &bull; 4)/2 = 12 points. If you collect cards of only one color, then you score 0 points!&#10;&#10;Play as many rounds as the number of players. Whoever has the highest total score wins!&#10;&#10;";1999;6.75621;1.8261
114;Ransom;"This game comes inside what looks like a video tape case, which is definitely odd for a board game.  Inside the package are cards for properties on Manhattan island, workers, building materials, and building contracts.  Each turn, players turn over a card and either purchase it outright or auction it to the group.  But when the contracts get bought, players will need to negotiate a deal, because it's very difficult to build a decent sized building on your own.  The deal making is vicious and cutthroat, ergo the name.&#10;&#10;The 1995 edition features rules in English, Japanese, German, Spanish and French (see the Tidwell review).&#10;&#10;";1994;6.35904;1.625
115;I'm the Boss!;"The six Investor cards are shuffled and one is dealt face up to each player. Any Investor cards not dealt to the players are set aside for now. The Influence Card deck is shuffled and each player is dealt five cards face down. The player whose Investor is first in alphabetical order goes first. The player to the starting player&rsquo;s right places the Dollar marker on any space on the game board.&#10;&#10;Each space on the game board represents a potential deal which Investors have to approve the deal and the number of dividends to be paid to those investors.&#10;&#10;On one&rsquo;s turn, a player can open negotiations on the deal where the Dollar marker rests or roll the six-sided die. If the player rolls the die, the Dollar marker is advanced clockwise around the game board counting the available deals as spaces. Once the Dollar marker rests, the player may try to negotiate that deal or draw three Influence cards. If by drawing cards, the player&rsquo;s hand exceeds twelve the player chooses which cards to discard to the limit.&#10;&#10;Should a player choose to make the deal, the player negotiates with the player or players representing the Investors how to divide the money at stake. The amount is number of dividends written on the space multiplied by value of the shares written on the deal tile. Any or all of the players may use their Influence cards to affect the outcome of the deal:&#10;&#10;&bull;    Clan cards may act in place of Investors whether the Investors are in play or not.&#10;&bull;    Travel cards put Investors out of play for the negotiations. Some are specific for a given Investor; some are wild to be played on any Investor.&#10;&bull;    Recruitment cards can only be played in sets of three to steal another player&rsquo;s Investor and make it your own.&#10;&bull;    Boss cards give the player control of the negotiations.&#10;&bull;    Stop cards immediately stop the effects of Travel, Recruitment, and Boss Influence cards.&#10;&#10;The players are paid from the bank when a deal has been struck. The game board space is covered with the Deal tile (effectively closing the space from further game play), the Dollar marker is moved to the next open space, and play continues with next player.&#10;&#10;Once nine deals have been made, a die is rolled after each subsequent deal to determine whether the game ends (with the odds increasing each time). Victory goes to whoever has the biggest bankroll!&#10;&#10;--user description&#10;&#10;";1994;6.77186;1.9655
116;Guillotine;"The French Revolution is famous in part for the use of the guillotine to put nobles to death, and this is the macabre subject of this light card game.  As executioners pandering to the masses, the players are trying to behead the most popular nobles.  Each day the nobles are lined up and players take turns killing the ones at the front of the line until all the nobles are gone.  However, players are given cards which will manipulate the line order right before 'harvesting' heads, which is what makes the game interesting.  After three days of chopping, the highest total carries the day.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.53921;1.269
117;Ta YÃ¼;"In Ta Y&uuml;, a game of connections, one side tries to extend from the starting tile in the center to reach the western and eastern edges of the board while the opposing side tries to reach the northern and southern edges.  On your turn you simply draw a tile and decide where to place it, extending the network of tiles already on the board.&#10;&#10;Several refinements make this simple proposition into an engrossing game.  First, each tile is 3x1 (to be played on a 19x19 board) and has exactly three outlets (potential connection points). Second, your score is not simply the number of spots you've reached on one edge added to the number of spots you've reached on the other, but is the product of those two numbers.  So you can't just concentrate on one side and ignore the other, because zero times anything is still zero.  Third, on each side of the board there are three special points which score double if reached, adding a dab of focus to the choices.&#10;&#10;Interestingly, you need to play both offense and defense and will often have to decide to which use to put a particular tile.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.94747;2.0662
118;Modern Art;"Buying and selling paintings can be a very lucrative business.  Five different artists have produced a bunch of paintings, and it's the player's task to be both the buyer and the seller, hopefully making a profit in both roles.  He does this by putting a painting from his hand up for auction each turn.  He gets the money if some other player buys it, but must pay the bank if he buys it for himself.  After each round, paintings are valued by the number of paintings of that type that were sold.  The broker with the most cash after four rounds is the winner.&#10;&#10;Part of the Knizia auction trilogy.&#10;&#10;";1992;7.51359;2.2865
119;Cosmolancer;"Auf Heller und Pfennig takes participants to a medieval marketplace. Each turn, players place tiles onto the grid board that modify (either positively or negatively) the amount of money to be made by the shops that share that tile's row or column. Three times the board is filled with tiles and shop money is earned, after which the player with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;In Kingdoms, the first English-language version of Auf Heller und Pfennig, players try to collect the most gold by establishing castles in the richest regions of the realm while avoiding hazards like dragons, swamps, and trolls. The 2011 edition includes detailed plastic castles, a streamlined rulebook, and the addition of a wizard tile &mdash; one that increases the rank of adjacent castles, multiplying their scores &mdash; previously available only at game conventions.&#10;&#10;As of 2024, Cosmolancer is the newest version of this design, with players taking the role of freelance photographers...in space! As in the other versions, the game lasts three rounds, and to start a round, each player draws a random tile and keeps it secret. On a turn, you either:&#10;&#10;&bull; Draw a tile and place it in an empty space on the 6x5 grid.&#10;&bull; Place the tile in your hand.&#10;&bull; Place one of your tokens, which are numbered 1-4, in an empty space.&#10;&#10;When all of the spaces are filled, you score each of your tokens, multiplying the number on the token by the sum of the tiles in its row and column, with some special tiles nullifying positive values or splitting a row into two segments. You retrieve all of your 1 tokens, but the others are now out of play. After three rounds, whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;";1994;6.67224;1.8361
120;Hoity Toity;"What do bored English noblemen do with their free time?  Well, according to this Spiel des Jahres (1990) winner by Klaus Teuber, they like collecting old junk and then showing it off.  Players buy or steal various pieces of junk in the form of cards, trying to form the largest and oldest collection.  Built on a 'rock-paper-scissors' mechanism, this game gives all players a couple of choices each turn.  The trick is in guessing what your opponents are likely to do, and planning your choice accordingly&mdash;only after everyone's decision is revealed do you know for certain whether you made the right one.&#10;&#10;Note: Hoity Toity (Uberplay, 2004) is for 3 to 6 players.&#10;      Spionage!

121;Dune;"Set thousands of years in the future, Dune the board game is based on the Frank Herbert novels about an arid planet at the heart of the human space empire's political machinations.&#10;&#10;Designed by the creators at Eon of Cosmic Encounter fame, some contend that the game can best be described as Cosmic Encounter set within the Dune universe, but the two games bear little in common in the actual mechanisms or goals; they're just both set in space. Like Cosmic Encounter, it is a game that generates player interaction through negotiation and bluffing.&#10;&#10;Players each take the role of one of the factions attempting to control Dune. Each faction has special powers that overlook certain rules in the game. Each turn players move about the map attempting to pick up valuable spice while dealing with giant sandworms, deadly storms, and other players' military forces. A delicate political balance is formed amongst the factions to prevent any one side from becoming too strong. When a challenge is made in a territory, combat takes the form of hidden bids with additional treachery cards to further the uncertainty.&#10;&#10;The game concludes when one faction (or two allied factions) is able to control a certain number of strongholds on the planet.&#10;&#10;Note that the Descartes edition of Dune includes the Duel Expansion and Spice Harvest Expansion, the Landsraad variant from Avalon Hill's General magazine, and additional character disks not provided by AH.&#10;&#10;";1979;7.58611;3.4498
122;Quo Vadis?;"In an interesting departure from his normally computational-heavy game structure, Reiner Knizia put together this negotiation game.  Players are represented on the board by a group of politicians moving through a network of committees, and need to seek support from their competitors to advance upward toward the Senate.  Supporting an opponent gains you prestige, needed in quantity at the end of the game.  Once all five Senate positions are filled, the game is over, and only players who have a politician in the Senate are eligible to win.  Of those players, whoever has the most prestige wins.&#10;&#10;";1992;6.46932;2.0842
123;Green Thumb Cards;"In this card game players are competing gardeners, attempting to collect sets of various plants in order to put them into their stacks.  In the meantime their incomplete sets are vulnerable to various event cards and other players.  Players have a number of attack cards at their disposal which they can use to wreak havoc on opponents' gardens.  These cards range from bugs and pests to kids tromping through the garden, and even animals that chew up or pee all over the plants.&#10;&#10;";1996;7.31034;1.2
124;Primordial Soup;"In Primordial Soup each player controls a species of primitive &quot;amoeboid&quot; organisms. Together these species form an ecosystem where each feeds on the excreta of the others. To win a player must guide the evolution of their species to increase their population and the sophistication of their genes.&#10;&#10;Each round consists of various phases. Firstly each organism must move (either by drifting or under its own power) and then feed. Then the environment undergoes a random change which changes the direction of drift and may force some organisms to give up genes. Then the species may buy new genes, and then may reproduce. At this point some organisms will die and finally each species is scored. This is repeated until either a species gets at least 42 points or the environment cards are exhausted.&#10;&#10;The possible genes include genes for enhanced control of movement, more efficient metabolism, more efficient reproduction, attack and defence.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Primordial Soup: Freshly Spiced&#10;&#10;&#10;";1997;6.92252;2.7305
125;Money!;"Your goal in Money! is to trade currencies with the bank and other players so that you end up with more value than anyone else.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a hand of six cards from a deck that contains cards in seven currencies ranging in value from 20-60, along with coins worth 10. Four cards from the deck are placed face up to its left and to its right.&#10;&#10;In a round, each player chooses a bid of one or more cards from their hand, then everyone reveals their bid simultaneously. Whoever bid the highest sum takes the four cards to the left or right of the deck or another player's bid, adds these cards to their hand, then places their bid next to the deck or in front of the player whose bid they took. (Alternatively, the player can return their bid to hand.) Then the next player with the highest bid resolves their bid similarly. Once all players have resolved their bids, draw cards from the deck to refill the lots to the left and right of the deck to four cards. When the deck runs out, play one final round, then score your cards in hand.&#10;&#10;If you have 200 or more in a single currency, score that many points. If you have less than 200 in a currency, subtract 100 from that amount but don't go below 0. If you have all three 20s or 30s in a currency, score 100 points in addition to whatever the currency itself scores for you. Sum these amounts, along with whatever coins you have in hand. Whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.5412;1.5616
126;The Really Nasty Horse Racing Game;"The world of horseracing has long been associated with cheating in all its forms.  But few games ever attempt to simulate that aspect.  Players are assigned a horse and must move it around the track by rolling a single die.  This would be rather boring if the game didn't allow for the players to bet on another player's horse, so the dilemma is whether or not to move your horse badly just to make it easier for the horse you bet on to win.  Even that could be boring, but then each player is issued cards that allow them to commit dirty tricks, for instance making a horse fall or forcing the winner to take a drug test.  All in all, it makes for some very interesting racing.&#10;&#10;";1989;6.28127;1.6582

128;Take it Easy!;"It's really difficult to succinctly describe this game, so take a look at the pictures! Take It Easy is a true multi-player solitaire in which each player individually completes a hexagon-shaped board with spots for 19 hexagon tiles. There's no limit to number of players if you've got enough sets on hand. One person (the caller) draws a tile randomly and tells the others which of the 27 tiles featuring colored/numbered lines crossing in three directions, with numbers from 1 to 9, it is. &quot;The 9-8-7,&quot; for example. Each player then chooses which empty spot on his own board he'll play the 9-8-7. This is repeated until the boards are filled.&#10;&#10;The idea is to complete same-numbered lines across your board. Scoring is calculated by multiplying the number on the tile with the number of tiles in the completed line. A complete column of three 9s is worth 27, for example...but a lot of players will hope for five 9s to fill the big column down the middle.&#10;&#10;Take It Easy is often compared to Bingo because of the familiar pattern of a number being called and then everybody looking at their cards to play it, and then scoring if a line is completed. But that's as far as the comparison goes.  Bingo is sheer luck; Take It Easy is a game of skill.&#10;&#10;";1983;6.60668;1.4871
130;Iron Dragon;"Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Iron Dragon takes railroading games where they have never gone before &mdash; to a land filled with elves, cat-people, trolls and magic. Genetically engineered dragons pull trains across dangerous and unexplored territory. Connect cities, fight off forest creatures, and explore the underground to build a railroad empire.&#10;&#10;Based on the Empire Builder system, this fantasy game puts classic building strategy and money management tools in a new venue. Players use erasable crayons on a special board and operate a rail empire. Perfect for an evening of fun and adventure with family and friends.&#10;&#10;In Iron Dragon, probably the most elaborate of the crayon rail games from Mayfair Games, players are set within a fantasy world attempting to create an extensive and profitable rail network.  Players use crayons to draw their rail lines on the game board itself and use their existing rail lines to pick up and deliver commodities for payouts dictated by cards.&#10;&#10;In addition to the standard mechanisms of Empire Builder, Iron Dragon introduces Foremen, which reduce terrain building/river crossing costs depending on their race (elves get a discount in the forest, dwarves get a discount in the mountains, etc.) and Ships, which allow trains to cross the sea between continents, avoid bottlenecks on land, or jump between two unconnected rail networks. Resources are much more segregated by region, with each region specializing in a few resources based on their back story (which is written in the manual).&#10;&#10;";1994;7.0062;2.9267
132;Caesar & Cleopatra;"Caesar and Cleopatra is a two player card laying game where players assume the roles of these two great leaders. Caesar wants Rome to invade Egypt while Cleopatra wants it to remain independent and both try to influence Roman officials to support their cause.&#10;&#10;Players take turns and send their agents, i.e. play numbered cards from 1 to 5 to influence one group of Roman officials, Aedils, Quaestors, Senators, Pretorians and Censors. They can send fewer agents face-down or more agents face-up. Additionally they can play action cards like Assassins that take out opposing agents or scouts that reveal face-down agents. Players can decide if they want to refill their hand from the agent deck or the action card deck but once one of the decks is empty they don't have access to any more of these cards.&#10;&#10;After each players turn, a card from the voting stack is revealed and the group of officials that is indicated on the card casts their vote. The player who has the most influence points next to that group wins one official from that group to his cause and then removes his strongest agent from that stack.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all the officials have picked a side and the player who has influenced most of them wins the game, with bonus points for the majority in each group and some simple hidden objectives.&#10;&#10;";1997;6.39673;1.9121

Although there is a rescue attempt in the works, it's still a month away.  In the meantime, the characters will have to live off the land or off of each other depending on how it goes.  Players attempt to guide the members of their group around the island, keeping them alive with the food they find in the desert.  However if their foraging is less than successful, finding some poor schmuck's meaty thigh is a viable substitute.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.13096;2.5455

The name means 'Trading House' and the players act as merchants vying for supremacy in late 17th century Amsterdam. By building trading houses at the canals you aim to control three major commodities (Spices, Tea and Wine) in each harbor area. During the game you expand by playing Land and Water cards in the large area of the harbor. By the end of the game points are awarded according to ownership of the largest commodity majorities in each harbor area.&#10;&#10;This game has many optional rules, scenarios, expansions and variations.

In it, players try to come up with a word that contains a certain sequence of letters before the ticking time-bomb in their hands explodes.  The bomb is an electronic timer with a variable time allotment, and a player is only allowed to pass the bomb to the next person when he comes up with a word that contains the needed letters.

139;Hoax;"The basic idea in Hoax is to pretend to be somebody you are not while working towards the goal of figuring out who other people are. Each player is assigned one of six different characters -- each with its own unique abilities -- but can pretend to be any character and use its corresponding powers.  Abilities are used to acquire 3 different types of goods, which can be spent to get clues to opponents' identities.  If the majority of the other players think you're pretending to be a character that you're not, you must either admit that you are not that character (and permanently lose the use of its power), or reveal that you are and win the game.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented as:&#10;&#10;    Die Erben von Hoax&#10;&#10;&#10;";1981;5.90022;1.3529
140;Pit;"Pit is an open-outcry commodity trading game. The first edition in 1903 had a deck of 63 cards, 9 each of 7 commodities, each with a value (ranging from 40 for Flax to 100 for Wheat). Players offer trades by crying out the number of cards they want to swap (&ldquo;One! One! One!&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Three! Three! Three!&rdquo;) but not their identity. The winner of the hand is the first to collect all of one commodity, declaring &ldquo;Corner on Wheat!&rdquo; or whatever commodity has been collected. The winner of the hand scores points equal to the value of the commodity, and the winner of the game is the first to 500 points.&#10;&#10;The 1904 Edition of Pit added much fancier artwork and the famous Bull and Bear cards, which provide wild-card and penalty features. The early editions allowed a maximum of 7 players, but later versions supported 8 and in at least one case up to 10.&#10;&#10;Pit&rsquo;s designer, noted psychic Edgar Cayce, is often accused of having stolen the idea from the game Gavitt&rsquo;s Stock Exchange (G-S-E) invented by Harry Gavitt. While G-S-E claimed patents dating as early as 1896, it involved trading railway shares, and was only copyrighted and published in 1903, the same year as Pit.  In addition, the only related patent assigned to Gavitt is US746492 A, filed October 7, 1903, and granted December 8, 1903.  Also hitting the market in 1903 was Bourse', a remarkably similar open-outcry commodity trading game from Flinch Card Co., using an 80-card deck with 10 each of 8 commodities, and Panic, using a 65 card deck with 8 each of 8 commodities and a Panic card, roughly equivalent to the Bull.  Pit, however, seems to have cornered the market on open-outcry games, as neither of its competitors were seen again after 1904.&#10;&#10;";1903;6.39876;1.1535
141;Andromeda;"Each player controls bases/stations (in the form of little wooden cubes) which they use to attempt to build Economic Centers on the moons of seven planets in an alien planetary system.  After moving their tokens on to a planet, players use an interesting little device ('planet ring'/'wormhole' - functions like a blind draw bag) to select one of the tokens on the planet.  Players take actions by collecting sets of cards which correspond to the the various planets.  The game also features a unique trading system which facilitates the card collecting. Careful card trading and calculating risk of establishing economic centers, and some variants, mitigate some of the luck factor.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;Setup: 9 cards/player. Place 1 cube per planet per player, plus additional cube per planet matching cards dealt out; remaining cubes on earth. Each gets 2 special action cards.Each round: First, players may play a single special action card, in order. Then, Trade Step. Finally, Action Step.&#10;&#10;Trade Step: Start player first plays cards (2-3) to offer, one at a time; other players simultaneously show cards to trade, different than offered. Start player must trade; recipient either accepts cards into hand, or leaves out. Clockwise from Start Player, next player with cards still in front of them either makes a trade or takes their cards back. Continue till 0-1 people left with cards in front; they take them back to hand.&#10;&#10;Action Step: Start player takes 3 actions, then others take 2 each. Actions can be:&#10;- discard 2 cards, then draw 2&#10;- turn in set of 3-7 cards to send half (rounding down) as many cubes from earth to a planet&#10;- turn in set of 3-7 cards to advance Ship Level, Tech Level, or to make attempt to establish colony on a planet matching cards played: place cubes on that planet into the cosmic ashtray, randomize, then reveal up to as many cubes as attempts made. If reveal your cube, place it on a station; turn over. If other player's cube, send it back to earth.&#10;- Sets: if no wilds (&quot;pure&quot;), take appropriate bonus wild card matching the size of the set (if available); wilds can be used later as parts of sets&#10;&#10;Then rotate starting player to the left. Game ends when all stations on 3 planets have been taken. Score VP shown on board (for Tech level, stations occupied, and cubes on earth). Most VP wins.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.38641;2.2248

143;Wortelboer;"In this very unusual card game, players are given equal stacks of cards, which have either carrots, bunnies, or foxes pictured on them.

145;Metropolis;"One of game designer Sid Sackson&#039;s greatest contributions to the negotiation genre, this game has players  trying to construct the best buildings in a rapidly growing city.  The map is a collection of city blocks broken into smaller properties.  Each turn, players choose one property and try to work out deal for placing a new structure on the board.  The value of each building is determined by the type of buildings in the same block, so both a school and an apartment building receive bonuses for existing together.&#10;&#10;";1984;6.36169;2.2353
146;Trading Titans;"Another of Reiner Knizia&#039;s fleet of games, this one is about making profits by buying and selling business stock. Players use cards to manipulate the price of three types of stocks (oil, technology, and retail), and the buying and selling of the stocks is pretty severely limited. Short and sweet, this game is both elegant and abstract.  In a change from the original version, the three stocks have different levels of volatility.  Technology is the most volatile, oil is the least volatile but with higher dividends, and retail falls in the middle.&#10;&#10;The original version of this game, Palmyra, was based around three trade routes which were represented by wooden amphoras.&#10;&#10;Note to reviewer: There is no difference, except for colour, between the 3 different commodities in the original 1996 Palmyra.  Because the 3 stocks are very different in game play in the newer Buy Low Sell High game, the newer game should have a separate listing from Palmyra.  It is effectively a different edition 2 game.&#10;&#10;";1996;6.13825;1.9821

Just as with real world energy companies, player will setup facilities for oil drilling, oil pumping, oil refining into gasoline, and gasoline selling to the consumer... all of which are represented by actual plastic pieces placed on the board!  Players also speculate by buying and selling oil and gasoline barrels in both the domestic and foreign markets... again represented by actual plastic barrels in their playing area!&#10;&#10;However, the changing economic climate, as well as sudden world news events, will challenge players to keep a long-term strategic view of the world energy markets.

151;Piratenbillard;"This interesting dexterity game is played on a table-like board that is a wooden lattice with a piece of linen stretched over the bottom.  Little colored balls are placed in the resulting holes, and then players use long wooden mallets to strike the bottom of the table.  When a ball is hit correctly, it will pop out of the space it's in and land in another space closer to the opposite side of the board.  Landing on another player's ball lets you capture it, but if your ball lands off the board, it's out of the game.&#10;&#10;";1989;6.55572;1.2414
152;MÃ¼ & More;"While the headline game, M&uuml;, is the main attraction, this deck of custom cards comes with rules for several games:&#10;&#10;    M&uuml; - A complex trick-taking game. For 3-6 players, ages 12 and up.&#10;    The Last Panther - A trick-taking game similar to Hearts, where players try to avoid negative points. For 3-8 players, ages 10 and up.&#10;    Wimm&uuml;ln - A trick-taking game where players must estimate how many tricks they will take, akin to Oh Hell!. For 3-6 players, ages 8 and up.&#10;    Rumm&uuml; - A Rummy-like card laying game where players try to get rid of their hands by playing high-scoring combinations of cards. For 3-6 players, ages 8 and up.&#10;    Safar&uuml; - A card &quot;catching&quot; game using basic adding skills. For 2-4 players, ages 10 and up.&#10;    Calcory (only in the original 1995-1998 edition) - A memory and calculation game, where players push their luck to uncover the most cards. For 2-4 players, ages 7 and up. Calcory uses wooden markers that were not packaged in subsequent releases, so the game was dropped from the set.&#10;&#10;&#10;M&uuml; is regarded by many as one of the best offerings in the trick-taking genre.  Players reveal cards to declare their bids: the highest bidder becomes the Chief and the second highest bidder is the Vice.  Both the Vice and Chief choose a trump (either number or suit), and then players try to capture tricks to score the most points.  The Chief chooses a partner and tries to cover the bid to score bonus points, while the Vice and remaining players seek to stop the Chief from reaching his goal.&#10;&#10;The deck consists of 60 cards in 5 different colored suits.  Each suit contains cards numbered from 0 to 9, with two of each the 1 and 7 cards.  Cards also have 0, 1, or 2 triangles printed on them to show the point value of that card.&#10;&#10;M&#195;&#188; and Lots More includes a a tweaked version of M&uuml; and a different set of games.&#10;&#10;2020 DiceTree Korean edition (titled The Last Panther + 6 games) includes Calcory and another new climbing card game &#234;&#184;&#176;&#235;&#147;&#156;&#235;&#157;&#188;(Ghydra) by Changhyun Baek.&#10;&#10;";1995;7.15609;2.5585

As in 6 Nimmt!, players are constructing sets of cards, with the fifth card in a set taking the whole thing.  This time, however, players take their turns sequentially and can play one to three cards from their hands.&#10;&#10;In a confusing twist, the Dutch edition of 6 Nimmt! is called Take 5! but is the progenitor game, not this game.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.55889;1.474

155;Was sticht?;"This is a two-trump, trick-taking card game, with several twists.  At the beginning of the game, players draft tasks they intend to complete in order to win the game.  (Tasks include things like &quot;Take no tricks&quot;, &quot;Take 1 Trick&quot;, or &quot;Take No Red Cards&quot;.)  Then, all of the cards are dealt out in front of the players before each hand.  Row by row, the players draft cards, and the dealer declares who would have won each row's trick, if it had been played that way.  Players use this information to deduce what the trump number and suit are.  After all the cards are drafted, each player - except the dealer - selects one of the task tiles she drafted, which will be her mission for the hand.  The dealer is stuck trying to uniquely accomplish someone else's task for the round - but at least doesn't have to preselect which person's goal he is trying to &quot;steal&quot;.  The hand is then played in the traditional fashion, with each player trying to take tricks or not, based on the goal she selected.

Players use different-colored crayons to draw rail from dot to dot, building their rail system.  A large deck of cards is used to determine how much money will be generated by picking up a particular commodity and delivering it to the listed city, with the payoffs being related to how far away the source is from the destination.  As players generate more money, they build successively larger and more comprehensive rail systems, hopefully connecting to almost all the major cities.

Players bid against one another to purchase the transportation tiles that are available each turn. To generate the gold for these purchases, players must make a choice each turn to either take gold or more cards. This can be a very difficult decision as tiles are useless without cards, and vice versa.&#10;&#10;As is becoming normal, this expansion was released shortly after Elfenland won Spiel des Jahres.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.94077;2.5818

The real points come when you slowly reveal your secret plan to him &mdash; or leave him to be eaten by sharks.

168;Empire Builder;"Epic Railroad Building in North America&#10;&#10;Discover a modern North American classic.  Celebrate one of our most vital and enduring passions: railroads.  Use your initial investment to build track.  Then pick up commodities where they are grown, mined, or manufactured and deliver them to a lucrative place of demand.  Complete a delivery and make the money you need to buy larger, faster trains, and expand your railroad empire.  Win the game by building the most effective railroad empire!&#10;&#10;The original and flagship of Mayfair&#039;s crayon-rails line allows players, using washable crayons, to draw their train routes over a map of North America.  Players start with an initial sum of money which they use to build short lengths of track during their first couple of turns.  For the rest of the game, players operate their trains over the track network drawn on the board to pick up and deliver loads to various cities, and then have the opportunity to add to their track network or improve their train.  The game uses demand cards which list three demands, each of a commodity to be delivered to a specified city for a given payoff.  Each player has three demand cards to provide opportunities for income.&#10;&#10;Each turn consists of an operations phase and a building phase.  During the operations phase, trains are moved to cities where commodities are picked up at no cost and moved to one of the cities on that player's demand cards.  When the commodity is delivered, the player receives the payoff and trades that demand card for a new one.  Event cards are mixed in the deck with the demand cards.  When an event card is drawn the instructions are followed.  During the building phase a player may pay to build more track or upgrade his train.&#10;&#10;A player wins by being the first to connect his track network to six of the seven major cities on the board and acquire $250,000,000 in cash on hand.&#10;&#10;";1982;6.96442;2.6318

Every player controls a 'family' and plays various cards to off other players' family members.  In a game with this little structure, it's possible for everyone to gang up on one unlucky soul, or for the damage to be fairly evenly spread.  Either way, the last family standing is victorious.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a gang of nine characters. To try to get rid of other gangsters, contracts are played on them. If these contracts are not blocked by anyone, the targeted gangster is placed on the hitlist. As soon as six gangsters are on the hitlist a mobwar is started. This means that, at the start of every turn, the first character on this list is eliminated. This goes on until the list is empty.&#10;&#10;Mobwars can also be triggered by cards being played. When no more than the last six or fewer characters are in play a constant mobwar is going on, until only one player has characters left.&#10;&#10;In general players take turns clockwise, however, the turn goes to any player who plays a response card and then clockwise mode is resumed with the player next to him/her. Lots of interaction as players play cards to put gangsters on the list, save them, have them replaced, start a Mob War, or stop it...&#10;&#10;";1982;6.07366;1.3187
171;Chess;"Chess is a two-player, abstract strategy board game that represents medieval warfare on an 8x8 board with alternating light and dark squares. Opposing pieces, traditionally designated White and Black, are initially lined up on either side of the board. Each type of piece has a unique form of movement and capturing occurs when a piece, via its movement, occupies the square of an opposing piece. Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture, attack, defend, or develop their positions. Chess games can end in checkmate (when the king cannot escape from the opponent's pieces), resignation (when one player recognizes that defeat is inevitable and ends the game), or one of several types of draws.&#10;&#10;Chess is one of the most popular games in the world, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. Between two highly skilled players, chess can be a beautiful thing to watch, and a game can provide great entertainment even for novices. The 2020 Netflix series, The Queen's Gambit was enjoyed by both chess players and non-players alike. There is also a large literature of books and periodicals about chess, typically featuring games and commentary by chess masters. Chess is so well known and highly regarded that it is often used as a metaphor in journalism, poetry, fiction, and film.&#10;&#10;Chess has its origins in the Indian game Chaturanga, which became Shatranj when introduced to the Persians. The current form of the game emerged in the second half of the 15th century when the Persians brought Shatranj to Southern Europe. The tradition of organized competitive chess began in the 16th century. The first official World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886. Chess is also a recognized sport of the International Olympic Committee.&#10;&#10;";1475;7.2261;3.6541
172;For Sale;"For Sale is a quick, fun game nominally about buying and selling real estate. During the game's two distinct phases, players first bid for several buildings then, after all buildings have been bought, sell the buildings for the greatest profit possible.&#10;&#10;The original Ravensburger/FX Schmid edition (1997/98) has slightly different rules than later English editions, and only 20 buildings instead of 30.&#10; The &#195;&#156;berplay 2005 Edition has new art, rules and card distribution changes, and it accommodates 3-6 players.&#10;&#10;The Gryphon 2009 Edition uses the &Uuml;berplay art for the faces of the property cards, while replacing most other art.  The rules are the same as the &Uuml;berplay edition, with the exception of the rounding rule (which was stated in different ways in different printings of the &Uuml;berplay edition).&#10;&#10;Rounding rule&#10;&#10;The rounding rule preferred by the designer Stefan Dorra is that players get back half of their bid rounded DOWN (not UP), as confirmed in correspondence with him here and here.  A history of how the rounding rule has changed in different editions is documented here.&#10;&#10;";1997;7.26129;1.2525
174;T-Rex;"Many regard this game as a trick-taking game, however that would be a very liberal interpretation of trick-taking.  Players are each given an equal set of cards, which they randomly pick a hand of seven.  Each hand one suit is a trump suit, and one suit is a non-trump suit.  Players place one of their cards in front of themselves, and this continues until the hand ends.  At that time, the top card on their piles are compared and the best card picks his reward first, and the remaining reward going to the second place.  The reward cards give players points, and the highest total at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.50693;1.9091
176;Give Me the Brain!;"Working in fast-food is hell.  All the employees are zombies, and you can't find a single brain amongst them.  Except for the brain part - there is, in fact, one brain - that's the premise of Give Me the Brain!, a card game in which players take on the roles of zombies in a fast-food restaurant in hell.  They all have to complete a number of tasks before leaving work, and the work keeps piling on.  Even worse, some of the tasks require basic intelligence and there's only one brain to go around.&#10;&#10;Note: Give Me the Brain: Superdeluxe Edition has 100 cards, instead of 112 with a few cards adjusted from previous versions.&#10;&#10;";1996;5.83556;1.2727
178;Mole Hill;"In this strange little game, players take the roles of a gardener protecting his lawn and a mole digging it up.  The gardener must try to block the mole's moves and fence him in quickly, while the mole must dig as many holes as possible before being caught.&#10;&#10;Essentially, the mole may move any direction, horizontally or diagonally from square to square, while the gardener places boundary sticks down along the edges of the square, which the mole may not cross.  The mole and gardener may either move or place down a boundary stick, and move alternately.  Eventually, the gardener will hem the mole in completely and the round is over.  In addition, if the mole can move into flower beds, extra points are scored.  By moving to the center, the mole may also tunnel deeply to any selected square on the board, thus escaping the (by then) rapidly closing trap of boundary sticks.  Depending on how many moves this took, more or less points are earned by the mole.&#10;&#10;Once points are totaled up, the roles are reversed and another round is played.  The winner is the player who scored the most points as the mole.&#10;&#10;";1997;5.99224;1.7188
180;Pool Position;"The setting is pool side at a swanky hotel and players are trying to get their beach towels into the choice locations next to the pool.  Players use equal sets of power cards to determine the number of placement points for each round.  These movement points are then used to place their towels or dislodge others' towels.  However activity in a particular row of towels attracts the attention of the cabana boys, who can eventually lock a row up permanently.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.77071;1.7273
182;Hungry;"In this quick, fun, and fairly abstract game, players play cards in an effort to acquire tiles that are either color-coded or number-coded.  Players take turns, first playing a card onto a tile that matches either the card's number or its color, then drawing to refill their hands.  When all cards have been played, each tile is evaluated, and whichever player has the most cards played to that tile gets that tile's points.  After calculating point totals and figuring in bonuses, the player with the highest score is the winner.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.36164;1.4239
186;Split;"Newer version of SPLIT is now available. Publisher is GDC-GameDevCo Ltd. The game still features the patented SPLIT half cards and looks much better than the original (design wise) and seems to have some adjustments to the rules.&#10;&#10;In this surprisingly solid offering from Hasbro, players use cards to take actions on a board.  The cards depict halves of a standard deck of cards, and players attempt to match the halves with those next to the board.  Depending on the quality of the match (perfect, strong, weak), the action is likewise powerful or weak.  The object of the game is to place a series of your markers in a continuous line across the board.  Also the game is scalable for two to six players, with four through six using partners to keep the action interesting.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented as:&#10;&#10;    Split (Revised Edition)&#10;&#10;&#10;";1999;5.93023;1.1333
188;Go;"By all appearances,  Go is just two players taking turns laying stones on a 19&times;19 (or smaller) grid of intersections.  But once its basic rules are understood,Go shows its staggering depth. One can see why many people say it's one of the most elegant brain-burning abstract games in history.&#10;&#10;Players place one stone at a time on the board at an empty intersection. The goal of the game is to try to claim the most territory by walling off sections of the board and surrounding or capturing each other's stones.  The game doesn't end until the board fills up, or, more often, when both players agree to end it, at which time whoever controls the most territory wins.&#10;&#10;";-2200;7.65564;3.9253
190;Dolce Vita;"Players are socialites who are trying to take as many high-value luxuries as they can manage.  A number of luxuries (boats, mansions, watches, boats, etc.) of values varying from one million to seven million are laid out in a matrix.  Players take turn placing power cards in the columns, and after five of the six cards have been played, the highest bid takes the first luxury in the column, the second highest gets the next one up, and so on.  However, if you collect a second luxury item you already own, then the newest one replaces the older one, which could mean exchanging a lavish seven million dollar car for a paltry one million dollar one!  After the specified number of rounds, the highest valued collection is deemed the best.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.14089;1.6875
192;Nicht die Bohne!;"This warped but fun card game is more intense than it first appears to be.  Players try to collect points in four different suits, but along the way points can be made negative instead of positive or even canceled entirely by taking one of the 'Nicht die Bohne' cards.  With its interesting trading mechanism, this game can be a little hard to grasp at first, but it's worth the effort.  A note to the wise: although this game shares a common theme of beans (Bohnen) with Bohnanza, that's about the only similarity.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.32002;1.3486
194;Groo: The Game;"In Groo: the Game, players compete to be the first to build a large town by playing 'building' cards that give them victory points.  Of course, this is no picnic, hindered as it is by other players' rampaging armies and the frequent bumbling visitations of Groo the Wanderer, determined by the roll of a set of dice, which can also grant players resources with which to build and 'Groo heads' with which to damage the unfortunates who have Groo in their village. Players can also develop armies to attack other players' cities  Excellent fun for the beer-and-pretzels crowd.&#10;&#10;";1997;6.28563;1.4865
196;Kremlin;"A game of political intrigue set in the Soviet Politburo of the early 20th century, with a satirical edge.  With politicians like Eduard Boremtodev, Nikolai Shootemdedsky and Natasha Nogoodnik vying for control of the party, you know the battle will be an entertaining one.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, a number of politician cards are laid out to fill the positions of the politburo.  Players then secretly note influence on ten politicians they hope to control during the game, indicated by a number from 1 to 10.&#10;Gameplay is not clockwise, but proceeds phase by phase with the politician holding the relevant office performing the appropriate action by the player who reveals the greatest influence on the politician in question.  Players attempt to remove politicians opposed to their interests by purging, exiling them to Siberia or by demoting them within the Politburo.  One&rsquo;s own preferred politicians can be promoted or pardoned of their previous &lsquo;sins&rsquo;. &#10;But each action a politician takes causes him (or in one case, her) to age by one or more years (a measure of the aging effect of the stress of the job). Each turn, politburo members face a health check which can result in the politician becoming ill, or even dying.  The 'older' a politician gets the more likely it is that he (or she) will become ill.&#10;At the end of each turn, the Party Chief must be healthy enough to wave to the crowd at the October parade. Controlling a politician who succeeds at this three times makes you the winner.&#10;&#10;The original Fata Morgana edition included rules requiring the players to hold funeral speeches for deceased party chairmen and drinking vodka with it, for instance. The later Avalon Hill edition scrapped these rules and gave the game a less satirical and more serious tone.&#10;&#10;Jolly Roger reimplemented an edition providing three different KREMLIN games in one box -See Kremlin (Third Edition)-:&#10;&#10;1: The 'original' with fictional politicians, set in a USSR where KGB investigations send those found guilty to Siberia. This version will have victory conditions based on the original Fata Morgana rules.&#10;&#10;2: A version inspired by the Avalon Hill variant titled 'Revolution'. Set in the 1920s, it uses historical politicians as well as fictional politicians. It's a more violent game as those arrested by the KGB are shot and removed from the game&#10;&#10;3: A new version, set in the modern USSR and Russia, an era of entrenched bureaucracy and alternatives for escaping KGB persecution. This version introduces the concept of &quot;Going into Exile&quot; to avoid Siberia. It also includes modern politicians from the 1960s onwards, whether it is Kosygin or Putin and Gorbachev.&#10;&#10;";1986;6.96878;2.8493
198;Buried Treasure;"In Buried Treasure, players compete to compile sets of colored cards by drawing from several common stacks.  Depending on what symbol is on a card, drawing it might let you take another from the stacks or even steal cards of the same color from one of your opponents.  At the end of the round, the majority holders of each color will gain points; the amount of points varies each round.&#10;&#10;Was awarded the title &quot;Best Family Card Game&quot; by Games Magazine in 2000.&#10;&#10;";1992;6.01264;1.5714
200;Entdecker;"[Careful: there are two similar games with Entdecker in the title. Don't confuse Entdecker with Die Neuen Entdecker (also known as Entdecker: Exploring New Horizons), a different game. In short - if your Entdecker's board has a scout trail leading to native huts, it's not this Entdecker.]&#10;&#10;Entdecker starts with a blank game board that represents an unexplored sea. Tiles are drawn and placed on squares on the board. As the tiles are placed islands develop on the board and players pay to place settlements, bases, or scouts on these islands in an effort to become the most powerful discoverer of all. Completed islands yield victory points to all who have invested in exploration on an island, but of course the most points go to the player who has established the strongest presence.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Die Neuen Entdecker or Entdecker: Exploring New Horizons&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     In 2004, a smaller version of the Entdecker game was released, based on the online version available on the www.playcatan.de site.&#10;         Oceania.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     In 2007, the game system was revamped in a new &quot;Entdecker&quot;-series of 3 titles (so far):&#10;         Im Reich der Jadegottin (published 2007)&#10;         Im Reich der W&#195;&#188;stensohne (published 2008)&#10;         Im Reich der D&auml;monen (not yet published)&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;";1996;6.42022;2.2468
202;Targui;"Conquer and occupy the valuable desert grounds. And also keep your home village! By tactically moving groups of camels through the different desert grounds and by using its specialties you can rule the desert. -- from the rulebook&#10;&#10;Targui has a board made of large square tiles representing the different types of desert ground. These provide varying economic and strategic value, from 0-5, and with a salt mine in the center, random distribution (with a little tinkering) makes a varied map each game. Players have a village tile which they place on the outer edge, and start with some camels and money. Your turn simply consists of moving and buying camels, expanding your control of the land.&#10;&#10;Targui has very simple mechanisms, and is in effect a simple rolling war game with obvious tactics. But the random turn order creates a wonderful world of rapidly shifting alliances, with players making and breaking promises within moments. The winner is not the one with most money or camels, but with the most economic value under their control.&#10;&#10;The game plays nicely with 3 or 4 players. However, Targui is a long game. Eight rounds takes about three hours, so using the whole deck of 20 fortune cards makes for an over-long game. If you enjoy Risk or light wargaming, then you'll get a lot from Targui.&#10;&#10;";1988;6.40073;2.3871
204;Stephenson's Rocket;"Reiner Knizia expands his fleet of tile laying games with this game about colliding railroads in early 1800's England.  There are seven different rail companies that players can expand.  Each time you extend a rail, the other stockholders can veto your action, but it might cost them their shares.  When two companies' rail touch, the railways merge to become one.  The game is over when only one company remains or there are no rail tiles remaining, and the winner is the player who earned the most money over the course of the game.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.93631;3.0528
206;Jalape-NO!;"Jalape-NO!, first released as Pepper, is a trick-taking game in which you want to dodge the spiciness to end up with the lowest score possible.&#10;&#10;The deck consists of 108 cards (102 number cards and 6 pepper cards), with cards being numbered 1-18 in six colors and with the 1s being peppers. Based on the player count, you use 4-6 colors of cards ranging from 1-9 to 1-18.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, you receive 12 cards in hand, and you must place any peppers on the table in front of you. The lead player in a trick plays any card from their hand or one of their peppers. Each other player must follow suit, if possible, except that you are not forced to play the matching pepper card, should you have it. (However, if you do have it, you cannot play a pepper of another color to this trick.) Whoever plays the highest card in the suit led wins the trick and leads the next trick. If you win a pepper in a trick, place it on the table in front of you; you can play this pepper on a future trick, whether to lead off the trick or to play it on a trick that's already in progress.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player has no cards in hand, the round ends. All players add any cards in hand to the cards in front of them, whether peppers or cards claimed in tricks. Each pepper you have is worth 2 points, and each card in the same suit as a pepper you have is worth 1 point. After five rounds, the player with the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.23529;1.4
208;Ex & Hopp;"A quick and simple card game for 2-6 milk-drinking players. Each player places a color card down as their marker and the matching sets of cards numbered 1-12 in those colors make up the deck. The deck is shuffled and players get 4 cards, the remainder goes down as a draw deck. There is a set of small tiles in red and black for negative or positive points (red are 4,4,5,5,6,6, black are 2,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,6,6,6). These are shuffled face down and 4 turned up to start 4 rows.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you can place a card against a row or try to swap a card with another player. If you want to swap, you simply offer a color for another color, mentioning no numbers. Swap with the player of your choice, but if nobody wants to swap, you've wasted your turn.&#10;&#10;When you play a card to a row, you draw back so you have 4 cards. When the row is full, determined by the number on the tile, the player with the highest total in the cards has to take the tile, be it positive or negative. Usually your choices are obvious, but sometimes it is worth assisting another player to take a row, rather than waste a good card for you on a low or negative tile. If a row is tied between players, the cards are discarded and the tile stays for more cards.&#10;&#10;The discard deck is shuffled over, taken tiles refreshed by new ones. The game ends when the tiles are all taken, deduct the negative from the positive to get your score.&#10;&#10;This game was re-themed and expanded on with Relikt.&#10;&#10;";1996;5.48116;1.1667
210;Don Pepe;"In this twisted little game, players take control of a gang of mobsters that are dedicated to extorting money out of businesses and rubbing out the competing mobs in the process.  All of the gang members are placed around an oblong table, with some of the places indicating certain benefits.  If a place has a picture of a business, then the player makes money until the mobster is killed or moved.  If the place has a gun, then he can use it to shoot a mobster across the table.  If a place has a knife, then he can use it to stab someone seated next to him.  Plus, some of the mobsters have the ability to kill others all the time by carrying their own knives and guns.  The game ends when all the available money is taken, and the largest pile of cash takes the game.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.28225;1.2903
214;CafÃ© International;"This game revolves around the placement of multi-national customers in a restaurant. The board shows many different tables, each with four chairs around them. The tables are grouped by nation, so the Chinese like to sit with other Chinese. However, some of the chairs are on the border between two nations, so a person from either place could occupy the seat. To further complicate this odd tile game, each of the people is either male or female, and tables must be gender-balanced.  As the game progresses some tiles become unplayable...&#10;&#10;";1989;6.22041;1.6422
216;Atlanteon;"The original edition, titled Revolution, is set in French Revolution-era Paris. Royalists and Jacobins fight for superiority in the 25 city districts, which are represented by the game board. The two players alternately place one of their counters in order to control that space. When a player puts one of his number counters on the board, he projects influence onto the neighboring spaces in that row and column, and onto the space the counter itself is on. The amount of the influence corresponds to the number on the counter. Whoever controls all three of the buildings or controls eleven city districts has won the game.&#10;&#10;The game was later reprinted as Atlanteon, in which mighty undersea warriors fight to control the capital of the Sunken Kingdoms. One player controls the vicious Marauders, who are trying to capture the city, while the other player controls the heroic Guardians, who are trying to defend their home.&#10;&#10;";1992;5.84261;2.026
218;High-Bid;"Players represent collectors attempting to gather sets of valuable properties and artifacts ... coins, antiques, miniatures, etc. These sets are worth handsome sums at game's end. Individual pieces of a set are worthless at game's end, but are able to be sold during the course of the game in order to provide a cash-flow.&#10;&#10;These 'properties' are represented on cards. There are 12 different types of properties, varying from 3 - 6 pieces per set. Naturally, the sets containing six pieces are much more valuable than the sets containing only three pieces as it is much more difficult to complete these larger sets.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt six cards and given a starting 'fund' of $2,000. The top 'property' card is revealed and a bidding ensues. The winner pays the bank and takes the card into his hand. The player then has the option of selling 1 - 3 properties to the bank. The idea here is to rid yourself of properties that you do not wish to collect and provide a source of income.&#10;&#10;There is danger, however. The sales price is determined randomly via the roll of two dice. The price can vary from 25% - 100% of the listed worth of the item. Further, if a '0' is rolled on one of the dice, then the item is NOT sold outright, but rather an auction takes place amongst the players. This can result in a substantially reduced price to the seller, or a higher price, depending upon the demand for the item. Further, it is quite possible that no one desires the item, so the seller must take the item back into his hand. There is also the possibility that the player will earn a $200 bonus if the proper digit is rolled on one of the dice.&#10;&#10;When a property is sold, it is placed on the appropriate section of the 'board' - 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% (there really isn't a board, just a card holder that indicates these sections). After a player sells properties, he may surrender one of the special 'buyer' cards and purchase from 1 - 3 cards from one of these markets. The player must pay the indicated price (based on the particular percentage market where the property is located) and take the property into his hand.&#10;&#10;Again, there is a decision to be made here. Buyer cards are very valuable, as they can be used in a number of fashions:&#10;&#10;1) Purchase properties, as described above;&#10;&#10;2) Used as a 'wild' card to complete a set; or&#10;&#10;3) Valued as $500.00 at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;So, a player has to weigh the advantages of each of these options and play accordingly.&#10;&#10;Buyer cards are purchases at auction in conjunction with a property card. When a Buyer card is revealed, another card is then revealed, and both cards are then auctioned together. The auction is a 'sealed' auction, however, so the stakes are often high as these cards carry tremendous advantages.&#10;&#10;The game continues in this fashion until the property deck expires or a player calls an end to the game. One can only do this, however, if he has a total value (property sets plus cash) in excess of $5,000. Even then, a player should only do this when he feels he has more assets than any of his opponents.&#10;&#10;As High Bid, this game was published for the 3M Bookshelf Series and 3M Gamette Series.&#10;&#10;";1963;5.89597;1.7941
220;High Society;"In Reiner Knizia&#039;s High Society, players bid against each other to acquire the various trappings of wealth (positive-number and multiplier cards) while avoiding its pitfalls (negative number and divisor cards).  While bidding, though, keep an eye on your remaining cash - at the end of the game, even though all those positive-number cards might add up to a win, the player with the least money isn't even considered for victory.&#10;&#10;In 2003 re-published by &#195;&#156;berplay.&#10;&#10;In 2003 published with a new theme by Amigo as Einfach Tierisch.&#10;&#10;In 2006, published by University Games as Animalement V&ocirc;tre (French version) and Beestenveiling (Dutch version).&#10;&#10;In 2008, re-published by Eagle-Gryphon Games&#10;&#10;In 2018, re-published by Osprey Games&#10;&#10;";1995;7.18509;1.4864
222;Space Beans;"This game is a successor to the popular Bohnanza but is less complex and is not based on trading.&#10;&#10;Players attempt to collect 30 points in &quot;trophies&quot; to win the game. This is accomplished by working with up to two collections of space beans - 1 public (face-up) and 1 secret (face-down).&#10;&#10;The primary mechanic is drawing beans, placing them in one of your collections (public or secret) if you have any matching cards to play, then passing your entire hand to the player on your right. If you compile a collection that contains a number of beans equal to the number value on one of beans in the collection, you may redeem the collection for the same amount of points on that card.&#10;&#10;For example: If a player has three violet beans, and one of them has a value of 3, that collection can be converted for three trophy points. The card numbered 3 would go into the trophy pile, and the other cards into the discard pile.&#10;&#10;Space Beans is part of the Bohnanza family of games.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.08904;1.3833
224;History of the World;"History of the World works under the assumptions that all empires eventually fade and that the only things differentiating great empires from lesser ones is how much territory they conquer and how long it takes for their civilizations to disappear.  The game is played out over 7 epochs or rounds, from the ancient 3000 B.C. Sumerians to the pre-WW1 Germany, with every player controlling a new rising empire from history.  Some empires are stronger than others (like the Romans), but the game's clever mechanisms can help balance that out.  At the end of each epoch, players score points for all units of their color (from both the current and any previous empires) remaining on the board.&#10;&#10;Before the start of their turn a player may play up to two Event cards from their hand.  The Events played are resolved before the player starts his Empire's actions.  If the player's active Empire has navigation a ship token is placed in each sea or ocean listed (if an ocean is listed all adjacent seas to the ocean have ship markers put into them).  A Reallocation Greater Event allows an Empire with Navigation to exchange Fleets in seas and oceans for Coins that can be used to buy back defeated troops (1 coin per troop).  If the active Empire has a capitol it is taken and placed in the Empire's starting land with one unit of the Empire's available troops.  Since each land space may only contain one troop the player begins expanding from their starting land by placing troops in any adjacent land space that they wish to occupy or conquer.  To conquer a land the attacker moves one unit into the land space either from adjacent land or through a sea with a ship in it.  Then dice are rolled, the attacker gets 2 dice and the defender only one, unless the attacker traveled across a strait or the defender's land has either a forest, the great wall of China, or mountains on the border of the land that the attacker came from.  In this case the defender receives 2 dice as well.  If the attack comes from the sea the defender gets 3 dice for defense.  Highest score wins with ties killing off both the defender and attacker.  In this case the attacker can merely place the next troop, if he has any left, in the now-empty land space.&#10;&#10;At any time the active Empire player may exchange an unplaced troop for a fort.  On later turns, a fort gives the player a +1 to defensive rolls in that land.  Also, if the defender in a fort loses or ties with an attacker only the fort is removed and the battle continues.  Whenever an army conquers a land with a capitol the capitol mini is flipped reducing it to a city (if it was a city to begin with it is removed from board when conquered).  After the active player's Empire is finished with it's actions check to see if it conquered to land spaces with resource symbols, if so it can build a monument.&#10;&#10;Then scoring takes place.  Each area (Middle-East, Northern Europe, Eurasia, etc...) has a tile with 3 values for the current Epoch.  One value is for having a presence in the area (at least one land).  Another value is for having Dominance in the area (at least 2 lands and more than any other player in area). The last value is for having Control of an area (at least 3 lands and no other player has any in area).  These values vary from Epoch to Epoch and Area to Area (Middle-East is more valuable in early Epochs and fades in later Epochs, for example).  Total the scores from each area for all pieces of the player's color from all Empires controlled that remain on board.  Then add 2 points for each capitol controlled, 1 point per city and one point for each monument controlled. After all areas are scored the next Empire called takes its turn.&#10;&#10;After all players have taken their turns and scored, for the first Epoch, the player with the highest score gets to take a pre-eminence marker and places it in front of him.  These are secret bonus points (worth somewhere from 3 to 6) for the end of the game and may not be examined till then.  This bonus to leader helps balance the Empire-draw mechanic and makes it valuable to score maximal points even early in the game, rather than tanking to get a better draw later. Then drawing begins for the next Epoch with the player having the lowest score drawing first on up to the person with the highest score drawing last (and likely being given a less than optimal Empire by another player).&#10;&#10;After the last player has scored for Epoch 7 and the leader has drawn a pre-eminence marker, all players reveal their pre-eminence markers and add them to their scores.  The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;";1991;7.11455;2.766
226;Isi;"Isi is a colorful abstract strategy game played on two levels.  On a basic level, each player is moving a pawn around the island of Isi, picking up tokens - there's a little strategy here, because which tokens you pick up are important, and one player's pawn can interfere with the other's.  But on another level, players are spending those tokens to build 'trade routes' between cities on the same island.  Cities grow as they become connected by trade routes, and at the end of the game whichever city's grown the most becomes the capital city; whoever is connected the most to the capital wins the game.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Morisi&#10;&#10;&#10;";1999;6.58333;0.0
228;Lunch Money;"This card game simulates children (a little girl is featured on all cards) running around the playground beating up each other and stealing their lunch money.  Once you get past the strange theme, there's a fun little game where players beat each other senseless with cards like 'Poke in the Eye', 'Uppercut', and 'Humiliation.'  Not for the weak willed, this game is mean.  The last player still standing wins.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Beer Money&#10;&#10;&#10;Integrates with:&#10;&#10;    Beer Money&#10;&#10;&#10;";1996;5.6269;1.5147
230;Merchant of Venus;"Merchant of Venus makes players take on the roles of space traders chasing wealth and fortune. Each player moves their ship through interconnected systems on a fixed map, discovering new alien worlds to trade with. As players start to make money delivering commodities, their earnings can be used to purchase equipment and construct their own infrastructure. The player who first acquires enough total value in cash and port/factory deeds wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game uses a basic roll-and-move mechanism for movement, but modifies it with engine ship upgrades that let the players skip certain spaces during movement. When players reach cities and spaceports, they can buy and sell commodities. Different species are randomly distributed throughout the universe at the start of the game, and players will only uncover which species lives where through exploration in the course of the game - the layout of which species lives where works to offset the rigidity of the fixed map by making different routes through the map profitable each game.&#10;&#10;The prices a player receives for selling their cargo is determined by the species that lives in the system, and what commodities a port offers for purchase is determined by a unique and dynamic supply-and-demand mechanism. With their money, players can replace their spaceships with better models, or build factories (which create better commodities) and spaceports (which speed up trading). They can also buy upgrades for their ships (like shields, lasers, or engines).&#10;&#10;Variations included in the rulebook allow for interplayer combat and solo play, and the exact target wealth players have to acquire in order to win is decided on before each play.&#10;&#10;";1988;7.13279;2.8327
232;Serenissima;"The Theme&#10;&#10;In the fourteenth century, the Atlantic was an ocean without end and America was yet to be discovered. The Mediterranean was a sea of great prosperity - the only route between East and West. The greatest fleets of the age battled for the most lucrative trade routes.&#10;&#10;Trade cities like Venice, Genoa, Barcelona or Istanbul grew as powerful as whole nations, establishing trade routes as far as North Africa or Middle East, bringing back Spice, Gems or Gold to the western Mediterranean. SERENISSIMA recreates this era, when the Mediterranean was at the centre of world trade.&#10;&#10;The Game&#10;&#10;Each players assume the role of one of those four city-states. Their goal is to establish their sphere of influence in the Mediterranean, and share all sorts of commodities to make their trading empire the most prosperous. In the course of a game, players must build galleys, hire crew and buy/sell commodities. The value of goods can be influenced by players having monopolies in certain commodities. Players can also take control of ports, thereby earning extra income from players using the port, as well as being able to get this port's specific commodity.&#10;&#10;In the end, the scoring is based on the number of ports each player control, but also on the fact that those ports have commodities of different kind available. Ports come in three types : small, medium, and city-states. Whereas small ports are quite easy to satisfy (they need only two commodities to be considered &quot;full&quot;), the four starting city-states are far more difficult to please, as they will need all kind of commodities available (6 additional commodities, plus the one they produce).&#10;&#10;During the course of the game, the number and type of commodities available in ports also controls the number of crew members you can hire, if you can build galleys or forts, and the price of commodities when you sell them. For example, a player won't be able to build new galleys until they have wood and iron available in one of the ports they control. Once a galley has been built, it has 5 spaces available, that can be filled by the crew or the goods. Every crew member allows movement through one space, and makes the galley more powerful. But those spaces are also needed to carry the goods that are worth money. Money that can be used to hire new crews, build new galleys, or commodities. A balance thus needs to be struck between trading commodities and taking control of ports - between a fleet of merchant galleys and a fleet of warships.&#10;&#10;The game lasts between 5 to 8 turns depending on the number of active players. Turn order is defined by bidding. The winner of the bid choose whether he will play first, second, third or last. Depending on the situation and what the player wants to do, playing first or last might be equally interesting. For example, by playing first, a player would be unable to react to other players move, but he could avoid having his galleys blockaded.&#10;&#10;";1996;6.85083;3.0347
234;Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage;"This game uses the very popular card system which first appeared in Avalon Hill&#039;s We the People game to detail the struggle between Carthage's Hannibal and the Roman Republic in approximately 200 BC.&#10;&#10;Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage is an asymmetrical card driven game for 2 players set in times of epic struggle between ancient Rome and Carthage. It presents a conflict between two super-powers of Antiquity from classical Clausewitzian perspective, according to which a power only reverts to military operations when there is no other way to achieve the goal: political dominance.&#10;&#10;Players use Strategy Cards for multiple purposes: moving generals, levying new troops, reinforcing existing armies, gaining political control of the provinces involved in the war, and introducing historical events. When two armies meet on the battlefield, a second set of cards, called Battle Cards, are used to determine the winner. Ultimately both players seek victory by dominating both fronts: military and political.&#10;&#10;";1996;7.77878;3.4549
240;Britannia;"&quot;Britannia&quot; is a historical Strategic board-wargame that broadly depicts the millennia-long struggle for control of England, Scotland, and Wales. The game begins with the Roman invasion of 43 A.D., continues through the many struggles between Angles, Saxons, Picts, Norsemen, Scots, Irish, and other tribes, and ends with the Norman invasion of 1066.&#10;&#10;Britannia allows players to re-create this epic history, re-enacting important battles in some cases, altering the course of history in others. The game rules discourage players from making historically unrealistic moves, but also give players the freedom to alter Great Britain&rsquo;s history in important ways, creating countless interesting &ldquo;what if?&rdquo; scenarios. What if Boudicca&rsquo;s Revolt against the Romans had been more successful? What if the Romans and the Romano-British had repelled the Saxon invasions of the 5th and 6th centuries? What if William the Conqueror had died during the Norman invasion of 1066?&#10;&#10;In Britannia, the players will determine the destiny of a kingdom.&#10;&#10;";1986;7.1895;3.1596
242;Junta;"Players represent various families in Republica de los Bananas. Each game turn has between 7 and 9 rounds, drawing cards, President assigns roles, foreign aid money is drawn, the president proposes a budget which is voted on, locations are chosen, there are assassination attempts, then the bank may be open or not, there may be a coup and aftermath, then the next round starts. The game is won by whoever has the most pesos in their Swiss bank account when the money runs out.&#10;&#10;The game is for 4 to 7 players (although there are 2 and 3 player variants).  A president for life (El Presidente) is elected and then she or he allocates roles for all other players.  Depending upon his or her office and the various cards they hold, each player has a certain number of votes. These are important for the first vote to elect El Presidente and then there are votes each turn on the budget proposed by the President. The budget starts when the President draws 8 money cards face down from the money deck (which varies in denomination from $1 to $3) and proposes allocations. Not everyone will be included in the budget and the amounts are at the President's discretion. The President can keep undisclosed foreign aid money.&#10;&#10;Players may attempt to assassinate the other players including the President by guessing where they will be from among five locations. Players who successfully assassinate another player take that player's unbanked money, the only safe money is the money that has been deposited in a players' Swiss bank account, and the only way to get to the bank is to survive the assassination round. Players assassinated or killed simply become another member of their family and begin again with new cards, but keeping any of their family's funds deposited in their Swiss bank account.&#10;&#10;If players are unhappy, see an advantage, or just want to, and there is a 'coup excuse', they can start a coup. A coup sees players compete using armed forces to control a majority of the 5 power centers. Rebel players control the forces of the role which they were assigned prior to the coup  (e.g. army, navy, air force), and players loyal to the President do the same, seeking to control the strongholds until the coup is over. At the conclusion of each coup players who have control of the 5 power centres vote to be pro-President or pro-Junta determining if the President stays, or the Junta wins and elects a new President. And someone is sent to the firing squad.&#10;&#10;";1979;6.688;2.858

In the Chariot Race game you pick your team of horses, driver, and chariot car, each of which have special characteristics . . . In Gladiator, you pick up your weapons and step onto the bloodstained sands, simultaneously maneuvering, striking, and waiting for that fatal step that puts you inside your opponent's guard.&quot;&#10;&#10;Battleline&#039;s Circus Maximus would later be developed by Don Greenwood and published in 1980 by The Avalon Hill Game Co as separate titles: Circus Maximus and Gladiator.&#10;&#10;Violent and bloody, Circus Maximus details the chariot races that occurred in ancient Rome.  Eight teams race around the track three times to determine victory.  Players prepare for the race by selecting the composition of their team of horses, their rider's skills, and the type of chariot that will be driven.  Once the race begins the players are free to do as they wish to hamper the other racers including whipping the rider, ramming chariots with scythed wheels, smashing into horses, and running over crashed opponents.  A campaign game of multiple races, in which players have to manage their teams and can increase their income by betting on races, is also possible.&#10;&#10;";1979;6.77623;2.6205

255;Jena-Auerstadt: The Battle for Prussia, 14 October 1806;"Extrapolated from a short review written by Francois Charton for the SPI Compendium&#10;&#10;A small mini-game picturing the twin battles of October 1806, about 100 counters (a little less in fact), one half regular size map, representing the two battlefields, connected by a series of off-map movement boxes. Game takes about 10 minutes to learn and 1-2 hours to play, high solitaire playability.  The rules are as simple as possible. Units have Zones of control, which cannot be exited. When in enemy ZOC, combat is mandatory. Units may advance after combat. Retreats through ZOCs are forbidden, so you need to surround the enemy to eliminate him. Artillery may fire two hexes away (and not suffer from adverse results). Cavalry units are just faster and weaker infantry units .  There are two scenarios.  The historical one pictures Napoleon in Jena, outnumbering the Prussians, and Davout in Auerstadt, outnumbered by other Prussians. ). To win, you have to eliminate as many enemy units as possible at the end of the game (thus demoralizing the enemy).  The second &quot;what-if&quot; scenario assumes that all the Prussians have been sent to Jena, for the decisive battle. Davout will enter as reinforcement, on the flank/back of the Prussians, but in the end of the game.

He follows that up by playing a unit, either German or Allied, that was available in the chosen year and could fight in the chosen environment, and the other players subsequently either pass or play a unit (of either nationality) that meets the same conditions.  When all players have made their selections, dice (sometimes) are rolled and totals are compared to determine whether the Germans or the Allies won.  The player who contributed the most to the winning team gets to decide how the convoy and the opposing enemy ships, which are all worth victory points and possibly an increased hand size, are to be distributed amongst the players who were on the winning side.

Additional money can be earned by building factories in each city, but these are limited in number.&#10;&#10;During the course of the game players will take turns buying and/or using plane tickets to move about the board's nine cities. A number of tickets are displayed in rows, divided into two types: The more expensive scheduled flights which allow you to move directly to the printed city, or move your token a number of city spaces orthogonally on the board. Cheaper charter flights allow movement directly between the two city spaces printed on the ticket. You may buy tickets at any time during your turn, and you are not required to move but must do so before taking any regular actions; you may also use any many tickets in a turn as you wish.&#10;&#10;The regular actions include building hotels and factories. Hotels are built on a u-shaped track. When a hotel is built on a red space the building that is oldest/furthest back on the track is removed. Players with the first and second most hotels on the track will be the only ones to score, with ties broken by the player with the earliest bulding on the track. There are only two factory spaces per city, and they will score points equal to the second place of the hotel scoring. In lieu of any actions or flying, or if you simply have no money, you may also take out loans; this removes your token from the board and forces you to use the more costly scheduled flights to return to the board.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game players are given all of their factories.

Most cards are good, but some aren't. &quot;Double or Nothing&quot; cards only count if you claim a pair of them. &quot;Toast or Most&quot; cards only score if you have the most of them, and &quot;Jackpot&quot; cards score jackpot points depending on how many you get. IT'S MINE! is great fun for Ages 7 and up. Kids are quick - so adults be on your toes!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;";1998;5.93013;1.0727
272;Downtown;"Taking a fairly common theme, this game is about building three types of neighborhoods in a developing city.  Each turn one or two blocks will get zoned, based on the players' votes.  Once all four properties in a block have been bought and the block has been zoned, its base score is the number of completed blocks adjoining it.  However, there are serious multipliers (positive and negative) for locating certain types of developments next to each other.&#10;&#10;1st Place 1996 Hippodice Spieleautorenwettbewerb (as Boomtown).&#10;&#10;";1996;6.33014;2.2353
273;Africa 1880;"Africa 1880 -- Relive the Colonial adventure with Africa 1880! Between 1880 and 1914 European nations fiercely raced to gain control of the Dark Continent. Each player represents a nation exploring and colonizing Africa. The success of their adventure, however, has more to do with intrigue in the luxurious parlors of the embassies than hacking away through the jungle. Negotiating alliances and declaring war are what change the face of the world!&rdquo; Contains 22 resin-cast miniatures, 180 die-cut counters, one game board representing Africa, one rule book in English and French, and order sheets&#10;&#10;";1997;5.67098;2.5625
274;Guerilla;"Guerilla is a multi-player simulation card-wargame. Three to six players vie for control of the government as rebels wage a civil war against those in power. As in real guerrilla warfare, the government forces are handicapped by their inability to separate friend from foe. This &quot;fog of war&quot; is accomplished by a clever dichotomy of goals wherein each player simultaneously commands both government and rebel forces. However, each player is secretly backing either the government of rebel cause and is severely penalized if his &quot;side&quot; doesn't win the hand.&#10;&#10;Consequently, players are always torn between scoring for their &quot;side&quot;, or for themselves, or even sacrificing their own resources for the sake of an opponent who appears to be on their side. But is he? Even when you think you've figured out who is who, the Revolution card can appear to change loyalties and totally cloud the issue again.&#10;&#10;Players score by eliminating opposing forces, manipulating the media and world opinion, or controlling various installations such as the Port or Airfield which grant special abilities to those who hold them. Government air power and armor columns struggle against ambushing guerrilla bands which fade back into the jungle without a trace. If atrocities are committed, the U.N. may intervene and attempt to stop the open warfare. Then the battle is fought by secret police who ferret out traitors while propaganda battles are waged for the hearts and minds of the populace. Assassins abound as influential leaders are targeted in an attempt to paralyze opposing troops in preparation for the day when the U.N. withdraws.&#10;&#10;Game length is variable and selected at outset. A game can comprise a single hand or be combined into three or more - resulting in a game from one to four hours in duration.&#10;&#10;";1994;6.26961;2.641
275;Extinction;"&quot;The Last Game They Ever Played&quot;&#10;&#10;Extinction is a card game for 2-6 players, Ages 12 and up. The object of the game is to create large herds of dinosaurs while making your opponent's dino herds extinct.&#10;&#10;The game is played over 3 rounds, representing the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods. During each round, players can meld herds of herbivorous dinos to earn points at the end of the round, play egg cards in hopes of adding to an established herd later in the game. There are several calamity cards that can be drawn, or played by another player, to throw a wrench into a player's plans. Some of these include meat-eating dinosaurs, egg-eating cards and gene pool disasters.&#10;&#10;The larger your herds, and the more herds featuring different types of dinos, the more points you can earn at the end of each period. The player with the most points after the Cretaceous period is the winner!&#10;&#10;";1993;4.96889;1.4
276;La Guerre de l'Empereur: The Emperor's War, 1805-1815;"La Guerre de l'Empereur: The Emperor's War, 1805-1815 is a game of maneuver and battle between the forces under Napoleon Bonaparte and six other nations that both opposed and supported him at various times in the years between 1805 and 1815. Players vie for dominance of early 19th Century Europe. As the French player, you'll set Napoleon and his armies upon a continent whose differing political statures plays right into your hands. The greatest army in Europe is at your hands...&#10;&#10;Divide and conquer! As the British player, you'll utilize diplomacy, clever event play, a powerhouse economy and the greatest navy in the world to become the dominant nation. As Russia, Austria, Prussia, Spain or the Ottoman Empire, you must strike a balance between expansionist aggression and diplomatic harmony among your neighbors. Indeed, a nation must expand to triumph. However the means chosen to that end will largely decide the level of success. Play  the part of being everyone's friend and your nation will likely live in relative safety...and lose the game miserably. Play the part of the blind aggressor and you'll likely go down faster than the peace broker. Striking a balance is critical.&#10;&#10;The game map covers the territories from Scandinavia in the north to the Mediterranean and North Africa in the south, and from deep Russia in the east to Portugal and the Atlantic in the west. Movement is by areas (provinces) on land, and sea zones at sea. On land, the units of maneuver are (roughly) corps, while at sea each unit represents a naval squadron. When opposing land armies meet for battle, corps are broken down into divisions (loosely) and deployed on a eight zone battle map for combat resolution. The dice-less combat engine uses a system of battle options which are played and cross-referenced for resolution of actual casualties and morale loss. The number of battle options distributed, along with the initial army morale of the opposing sides, is determined by army size, nationality and leaders present. The battle options are of offensive and defensive nature. The offensive options cover standard maneuvers such as &quot;Flank Attack&quot;, &quot;Cavalry Charge&quot; and &quot;Assault&quot;, while the defensive options are things such as &quot;Refuse Flanks&quot;, &quot;Squares Formed&quot; and &quot;Reverse Slopes&quot;.&#10;&#10;The rules are relatively simple and fast moving, even though a host of subtleties and complexities of the Napoleonic period are represented within the game system. The means by which this relative simplicity was achieved was (largely) through the use of self-explanatory strategic event charts. Be warned: This game is easy to understand and play, but very difficult to master.&#10;&#10;The game system works the same whether you're playing with two players or seven. With multiple players, you'll need all of your diplomacy skills to enlist aid in achieving your goals. With fewer players, the event charts will handle the bulk of the diplomatic duties. Regardless of how many players you have, all seven major powers will actively participate to a greater or lesser degree.&#10;&#10;";1997;6.4589;3.3846
277;Res Publica;"In Res Publica you are the will of the people, guiding five ancient civilizations to greater heights of power and technology.&#10;&#10;Each turn, the active player makes a trade offer... and each player in turn responds in kind. Using the cards and the information gained through the trading process, players work to acquire five identical people cards in order to build a city (which increases the number of cards you can draw each turn) or five identical technology cards in order to build a monument (which garners end game victory points).&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players total the points achieved via cities and monuments and the one who has the most wins.&#10;&#10;";1991;5.90777;1.7093
278;Catan Card Game;"Catan Card Game bears only a slight resemblance to The Settlers of Catan, the original game in the Catan series.  There are six resources: wool, wood, bricks, grain, ore, and gold. Before beginning the game, the players receive six square cards showing the resources, with a different die number on each card. In addition, the players start the game with two village cards and a road card connecting them. There are card stacks of more roads and villages, as well as cities, to be purchased during the game. With each new village or city comes two new resource cards. Villages and cities give victory points.&#10;&#10;When the number die is rolled, instead of collecting more cards, the players rotate the corresponding card 90 degrees to indicate a gain of one more of that resource; i.e., the brick card shows a picture of one brick on one edge of the card, two bricks on the next clockwise edge, three bricks along the third edge, and zero bricks on the fourth edge. There is also an event die, with five possible outcomes:&#10;&#10;&#10;     a reward for the player with more knight points or more 'windmill' points (a picture of a windmill on some cards),&#10;     a bonus resource,&#10;     an attack if a player has too many resources, and&#10;     one of six special events - civil war, conflict, master builder, plague, productive year, or progress.     &#10;&#10;&#10;There are 62 expansion cards in six stacks in the center of the table. Before beginning the game, players choose one stack, go through it, and choose three cards to hold in their hands. Forty-two of the expansion cards require spending resources to be put into play, gaining civic improvements or knights. Every civic improvement serves some useful function or adds victory points or both. Twenty of the cards are actions benefiting one of the players or harming the other. After a player pays to put a card down or uses an action card, he blindly draws a replacement. Unwanted or unusable cards can be traded in future turns. Some of the cards have flags on them, indicating victory points.&#10;&#10;Whoever first has twelve victory points wins the game!&#10;&#10;The Anniversary edition of this game (Jubil&auml;umsausgabe, tin box edition) can be found under a separate game entry due to some differences in content: Die Siedler von Catan: Das Kartenspiel &#226;&#128;&#147; 10th Anniversary Special Edition Tin Box.&#10;&#10;Belongs to the Catan Series.&#10;&#10;";1996;6.70148;2.4386
279;The Very Clever Pipe Game;"The game consists of a set of cards. The cards have white and black pipes in various six-outlet configurations, and players take turns placing them onto the table.  When a player constructs a completely closed-off section of pipe in their color, he takes all the cards from that section.  After all cards have been played, the player with the most scored cards wins.  Additionally, the cards also have two different floors (which appear underneath the pipes) that can be used to expand the game to a four-player affair.&#10;&#10;The game was re-released in 2002 with a reduced deck (48 cards instead of 120) as part of the Hip Pocket Games series.&#10;&#10;";1996;6.21525;1.5926
280;Neue Spiele im alten Rom;"Neue Spiele im Alten Rom (or New Games in Old Rome (NGIOR)) is a compendium of games from Reiner Knizia. In the box are fourteen games themed on ancient Rome. The games are themed to cover, albeit in a highly abstract fashion, the rise of Rome, the Roman Republic and finally, the Empire.&#10;&#10;(7 of the games are described below)&#10;&#10;The Wheel of History : 2-5 players&#10;&#10;This is an early version of what was to become Bunte Runde. 25 cards are laid out in a large circle, representing the tribes to be united under early Rome. Players may advance a pawn one, two or three spaces forwards and collect a card. Cards are scored on face value, but there are some quirks that vary this.&#10;&#10;The Seven Hills of Rome : 2 players&#10;&#10;This is one of the easier games in the compendium. The theme here is you are battling your opponent for control of the seven hills of Rome. The hills are represented by seven cards, numbered 1 to 7, laid out between the players. Cards are played from a hand against the 'hills' in an attempt to influence them to your side. You sum the hills you control at the end of the game, and the highest total wins.&#10;&#10;Mercator : 3-7 players&#10;&#10;This game is Medici&#039;s ancestor. It is a simplified version of Medici, with the chief differences being you can hold six cards on your ship, and you are competing for highest value totals only. The number of each suit taken is meaningless, except in a variant where you get paid a bonus if you get one of each. The game lasts only one round. Medici is worth purchasing on its own, but this is still worth a look.&#10;&#10;Imperium : 3-5 players&#10;&#10;The aim is to earn points for control of each of the 9 areas on the board. The game lasts 9 turns, and at the end of each turn, the area matching the turn number is evaluated for control and points are awarded. On your turn, 3 cards are revealed simultaneously. These cards are numbered 1 to 9, with 2 additional banner cards. The numbers correspond to the areas you want to place control markers into. The banner cards indicate you want one or two extra chips placed in the indicated area. After control markers are placed, the current turn's area is evaluated - points being awarded to the winner and perhaps the second and third places as well. After 9 turns, the player with the most points wins. As you progress, the points awarded for each area increases, giving a nice feeling of acceleration.&#10;&#10;Senator : 2-3 players&#10;&#10;You play a Roman faction trying to position your people (a hand of cards) into the senate. They can only get their via the senate steps. The board is a grid of 5x5 spaces, The 9 spaces in the center are the senate, while 12 of the remaining 16 are the steps spaces that run around the perimeter of the senate. Cards are placed initially on the steps, and then pushed into the senate by placing more cards on the steps.&#10;&#10;Circus Maximus : 3-5 players&#10;&#10;A simple chariot racing game where players are competing to be the first to get their team of three chariots around the hex map circuit and onto the podium. Each player has a set of cards face up in front of them, numbered 1 to 5. To move a chariot they select up to three cards per chariot which that is the movement allowance for that piece. The movement off each card must be in a straight line, so some rather clumsy cornering ability is built into the game. Cards used by a chariot are turned face down, becoming unavailable for the other chariots still to move. Each chariot must be moved at least once per turn, if possible. Therefore, the trick is to maximize your movement with your 15 points each turn.&#10;&#10;Consul : 2-4 players&#10;&#10;This is an intriguing memory game, that, like most of the games in this compendium, have a hard time being fitted into a theme! Twenty-five cards are turned face down in a grid. Players start the game each holding three cards in their hand. On their turn, players make a bid to take a turn. The highest bid gets to turn up cards until they choose to finish, or make a mistake. Cards in a set can be of the same value, or same color, or both. The value of the set must equal of exceed the bid made, simply by summing the face values of the cards. If a mistake is made, the cards are turned face down, and the player must discard a card from their hand into the grid. If the bid is made, the cards are taken into the players hand. At the end of the game, the highest total held wins.&#10;&#10;--&#10;&#10;Translated rulebook to the contrary, this game has never been published by an English publisher.&#10;&#10;Note: 3 of these have been printed/repackaged in English by GMT in Rome: Imperium, Circus Maximus, Hannibal vs Rome.&#10;&#10;";1994;6.83873;2.3333
281;Ostindiska kompaniet;"from the translation:&#10;The Swedish East India Company loaded their ships in G&ouml;teborg with Swedish export goods.  These were carried to Cadiz in Spain and there sold in exchange for Spanish silver piastres, the only currency acceptable to the Chinese and South Indian merchants.  From Cadiz the ships sailed east to ports in India and China (invariably Canton in the latter), where they sought to purchase the most profitable goods.  These were carried back to G&ouml;teborg and sold at a healthy profit.  (The Company actually supplied most of the Swedish GNP in those days!)  You will reinvest your profits in new cargo to start the Cadiz/Far East cycle again, but you must also buy shares in the Company.&#10;&#10;";1991;4.68571;2.5
282;Vikingatid;"Viking era is a game for two to six players. The game describes the Viking era in, for common family games, untypical detail. The players play Danish, Norwegian or Swedish Vikings. They move their fleets around the known world to trade, plunder and conquer. Furthermore, it is possible to discover hitherto unknown land areas. The game is over when all players are Christianized. The player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;";1997;5.95268;3.3
283;Advanced Third Reich;"Advanced Third Reich is a board wargame published originally by The Avalon Hill Game Co. The game is a rewrite of Third Reich,  and is a simulation of the European and African theaters of World War II. In 2003 GMT Games published A World at War, a substantially revamped and streamlined version of Advanced Third Reich, designed by Bruce Harper.  Designed to reflect the corps scale, a turn represents three months of movement and fighting.&#10;&#10;";1992;6.90633;4.5397
284;Lords of the Sierra Madre (Second Edition);"The setting is northern Mexico starting in 1898 where an economic boom, a dictator who welcomes foreign investment and wide-open land set the stage for one of the greatest capitalist free-for-alls in history. Each player is an hacendado. These entrepreneurs vie to build the largest empire of railroads, mines, ranches and other businesses. They may employ banditos, strikers and other sneaky maneuvers to tax, bribe, raid and destroy their opponents, often employing police, federal troops, even the US Army. They may even get themselves elected to the governor's office or the presidency itself (a crime in Mexico).&#10;&#10;";1995;6.36781;3.6
285;Monsters Ravage America;"Each player is one of six Giant Monsters, stomping across a map of the USA in search of cities to destroy. The monsters run the gamut from the classic (enormous lizards and gargantuan apes) to the slightly more unconventional (50-foot glow worms, anyone?), and each has its own set of attributes and powers.&#10;&#10;Ingeniously, everyone also controls an arm of the military, which can be used to attack and weaken the other monsters on the board. It's a losing battle for the militia -- monsters can wipe out military bases and reduce the total number of forces available to each player -- but you can get a few good licks in early in the game.&#10;&#10;The battle escalates until the 20th city is reduced to rubble. At that time, all the monsters duke it out in a free-for-all, mano-a-clawo Monster Challenge; and when the dust settles, the last monster standing is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;This game was remade into Monsters Menace America.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.87723;2.1905
286;Machiavelli;"Machiavelli recreates the historical situation of the fast developing and ever shifting balance of power struggle in Renaissance Italy. There are five major powers: The Republics of Florence and Venice, the Duchy of Milan, the Kingdom of Naples and the Papacy (which was a secular power in this era) along with 3 major foreign powers: Valois France, Hapsburg Austria and the Ottoman Turks. All of these states singly or in combination compete for control of the peninsula.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;Alea Magazine n&#194;&#186;22 contained seven new scenarios for Machiavelli.&#10;&#10;";1977;7.0967;3.1963
287;Bazaar;"The components of Bazaar include a whole bunch of little chips, in five colors. At the start of the game, two equation cards are randomly chosen. Each equation card has five equations on it, for a total of ten equations that will be in effect for the duration of the game. The equations state equivalences between certain combinations of colors, for example:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Red = Green Green&#10;    Green Yellow = Blue Blue Red&#10;&#10;&#10;Four target cards are turned up, each with some combination of five chips represented on the target card (so a typical target card might be Green Green Blue Blue Blue).&#10;&#10;On your turn, you roll a colored die to randomly pick a colored chip for yourself, or you can make one exchange of your colored chips based on the equations. The goal is to end up with the right combination of chips to get one of the target cards. You want to do this quickly &ndash; and even more importantly, with as few chips left over as possible after you've purchased the target card &ndash; because this is how you score points.&#10;&#10;The original version is part of the 3M Bookshelf Series.&#10;&#10;";1967;6.52311;2.0278
288;RossyÃ¯a 1917;"&quot;Rossy&iuml;a 1917&quot; is a Strategic level mid-high complexity board-wargame of the Russian Civil War 1917-1922. It covers the military aspect of the civil war at an operational level. Units are brigades and divisions, rated for steps, combat, movement and shock (quality) value. The full-color map covers Russia from the Polish border to the Siberian plains, superimposed with a hexagonal grid, each hexagon representing 25 miles.&#10;&#10;The game is played by players alternating HQ units and using them to perform various actions, including moving military units and initiating combat. Rules cover shock combat, political events, rail movement, naval movement, air power, tanks, armored trains, reserves and more.&#10;&#10;Game consists of 37 pages of rules, 2 maps measuring 80cm by 60 cm, over 1000 counters and numerous charts.&#10;&#10;";1995;7.25068;3.9167
289;Chariot Lords;"Between 1500 and 600 BC, Asia Minor and the Mediterranean witnessed the rise and fall of several mighty empires. Often the birth of one empire precipitated the death of another. How could a small people like the Judeans establish an empire when located between such giants as Egypt and Assyria? Why did some Empires endure for centuries while others lasted only a few generations? Chariot Lords shows you the how and why.&#10;&#10;Each Lord controls between 5 and 6 nations, some strong, others weak, each with varying goals and objectives - indeed some of these countries may not even exist at the same time. Players compete against one another to achieve the victory criteria for their empires. Nations quickly become rivals, involving them in death struggles over expansion. Each turn (90 years) will see new countries come to the fore, while established empires struggle to levy reinforcements and arrange alliances. A fine line must be walked between conserving one's forces and expanding one's empire. Too much expansion will see your resources spread thin and possibly swept away by a new emerging empire, but not enough aggression will see your empire fail to garner sufficient victory points to win.&#10;&#10;Armies are of a mix of foot and mounted units, along with the occasional leader of note. It is not enough to conquer -- you must be able to keep what you have taken. The winner will be the one who has the most victory points after all the armies have had their moment on the stage. It is up to you to determine whether your empire will be relegated to the dustbin of history, or whether others will hail you as...The Chariot Lord.&#10;&#10;Contents: &#10;&#10;    8 pages of Rules, 4 of notes and commentary &#10;    1 hard-backed map &#10;    140 3/4 inch square counters/markers &#10;    170 5/8 inch square counters &#10;    4 victory point charts with combat charts on reverse &#10;    4 nation force arrival charts &#10;    1 master nation force arrival chart&#10;&#10;&#10;";1999;6.69094;2.75

291;Courtisans of Versailles;"Amid the lavish splendor of the palace of Versailles, players strive to improve their standing among their fellow courtiers. Their mark, with either the Queen or Louis XIV himself, depends on how they manipulate elevated forms of etiquette, repartie, and the true passion of the court...The high art of ridicule. Circumstances change as the court moves from the palace to the hunt, and possibly to the front if war breaks out. Titles, awards, vast fortunes can be amassed through whim and wit, but be aware that a devastating faux pas could find you banished to the colonies, or worse yet, land you in the notorious dungeons of la Bastille.&#10;&#10;The original version, Aristo, published by Dragon Radieux, accommodated up to 8 players.

292;Attacke;"Themed as a joust of knights, Attacke is a simple card laying contest. The cards are in 5 colors and are numbered 2,3,4,5, &amp; 7. From a hand of five, a player lays one or more cards of one color, declares the total value, and draws one card. Following players must lay cards to beat that total in that color to stay in the round. If you can't or choose not to play, you're out and draw a final card. The round continues with players adding more cards to their total or dropping out until one player remains and that player takes a token in that color. There are joker cards (shields) of 7 or 10. First to win 4 out of the 5 colored tokens, wins the game.&#10;&#10;Ridiculously simple and really great fun. Do you contest this color seriously, or throw some cards down just to draw a color you need?&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Ivanhoe&#10;    Gem Dealer&#10;&#10;&#10;";1993;5.71386;1.5
293;Bamboleo;"This is definitely one of the more unusual offerings from our German friends. An assortment of oddly shaped wooden blocks are placed onto a round, wooden 'platter.' The platter has a cork ball on its underside, which is then placed on top of a conical stand. The trick is that the oddly shaped pieces are to be removed one-by-one, which has a high probability of upsetting the whole contraption's delicate balance. The bigger the piece that you remove when it's your turn, the more points you'll score, but you have a higher likelihood of spilling everything, which scores you negative points.&#10;&#10;";1996;6.31097;1.2371
294;Keydom;"Independently produced by British game designer Richard Breese, the three hundred copies of this game sold within hours of its initial offering at Essen 1998.  Players represent a family of medieval professionals, such as Stonemasons or Fishermen.  Using a set of numbered tokens and some misdirection, players try to achieve control in several areas of the board.  Perhaps they are seeking resources.  Or perhaps they will use their hard-fought resources to purchase special actions, magical spells, or a piece of the royal Keylore.  The first player to acquire all three pieces of regalia and take them to the throne room is crowned King and is the winner.  Re-tooled, this game was re-released as Aladdin's Dragons in 2000.&#10;&#10;Keydom is Richard Breese's second game in the key series.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Aladdin's Dragons&#10;&#10;&#10;";1998;6.8075;2.7143
295;Europa 1945-2030;"This game details the creation and expansion of the European Union in the years following World War II.  Players are represented by a group of EU delegates that travels across the many different countries of Europe.  When a country's threshold of resistance is equalled by the number of delegates, the country is eligible to enter the Union, assuming the players can come to an agreement.  Additionally as the game progresses, various countries have an increasing potential to fall into armed conflict, which the players must avert should they wish to retain their good standing.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.98079;2.6279
296;Medieval Merchant;"Players secure valued markets via affordable trade routes between medieval cities while simultaneously forcing opponents into less affordable and less valued markets.  The cities themselves have a variable number of spaces for players to develop business branches within, or alternatively establish new trade routes into wider reaching cities and towns.  Players may generate income and risk losing dominance over a city, or add branches within a city that lower the value of your product but can award you with a stronger market influence.  At the end of the game, the player with the most influence wins.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.70452;3.0916
297;Stadens nyckel;"In this fun but luck-intensive game, players represent noble families trying to build up their neighborhoods and have their family members in high offices at the right times.  These goals are aided by cards, which either aid families competing for high office or show buildings that can be placed in the neighborhoods.  At the end of each turn an event card takes effect, giving points to officeholders, allowing free building, or causing some other occurrence.  Layed out around the board during game setup, these event cards are revealed to allow players to see the upcoming three events.

299;De Bellis Antiquitatis: Quick Play Wargame Rules with Army Lists for Ancient and Medieval Battles;"A flexible, fast-playing set of miniatures rules. An army consists of 12 units (called &quot;elements&quot;), classified as Blades, Warband, Knights and so forth. The rules are very simple (and can actually fit on one sheet of paper) but nevertheless pretty effective.&#10;&#10;The Fantasy version is Hordes of the Things, and the De Bellis Multitudinis: Wargames Rules for Ancient and Medieval Battles &#226;&#128;&#147; 3000 BC to 1500 AD rules add more detail and significantly increase army size.&#10;&#10;De Bellis Renationis extends the time period through the end of the Renaissance (1700 AD) and Horse, Foot and Guns covers the period from 1701 to 1915.&#10;&#10;";1990;7.30947;2.802
300;Tutankhamen;"There are 69 artifact tiles in the game of Tutanchamun. These are shuffled and then laid out randomly in a long, serpentine trail. Players take turns choosing any tile from the trail, but can never turn back to choose a tile they have already passed. There are 15 different sets of tiles (three sets each of 8, 6, 4, 2, and 1), and when the last tile of any set has been claimed, the player holding the most in that set scores that number of points, while the player holding second most scores half that number. Complicating matters, there are also three tie-breaker tiles and three tiles that let you &quot;buy&quot; a tile from another player. It's an exercise in numbers that plays quickly, probably 30 minutes tops, and is suitable for youngsters yet susceptible to analysis. The game has a unique layout and a brightly-colored Egyptian pharaoh look. The new edition by Out of the Box Publishing games has different graphics, but is otherwise substantially similar to the original.&#10;&#10;";1993;6.10848;1.5926
301;Campanile;"Very nice combination of tile placement and betting. Players lay long tiles to build 5 towers taller and taller, whilst betting on which will be the tallest to shortest. The trick is that when you lay a tile to raise a tower one, two or three stories tall, this controls how much you can bet (1,2 or 3 tokens) and crucially, which draw pile you take from (pile 1, 2 or 3). Since the draw piles are face-up, I might want to draw from pile 3 to get a tile which will boost a tower I've bet on, but that means I have to lay a card three stories, and so I might have to play a tile from my hand that helps the other players! A very nice mechanism which gives those simple, frustrating choices we all enjoy. The scoring gives points to the first and second majority backers on each tower.&#10;&#10;";1996;6.15159;1.6765
302;Forum Romanum;"Long out of print, this is a popular placement game by Wolfgang Kramer, published in the Franckh Kosmos long box series. Actually very simple, players take turns to put their colored pieces in different rooms. Whenever a row, column, diagonal or room is full, it is scored, with the majority holder getting the value of the length, and any minority holders losing points. All lines or rooms are marked off when scored and when you run out of pieces to place, you must move a piece, which means you can suddenly lose a potential score you were building.&#10;&#10;";1988;6.74829;2.3514
303;Koalition;"60 politicians of all colors stand for election in the 15 countries of the European Union: unimaginable benefits and positions of influence await their power brokers, for it is these Machiavellian lobbyists and self-appointed &ldquo;leaders&ldquo; who hold the real power in the palms of their hands.&#10;&#10;With no thought for party loyalties or manifestos they pull the strings of their politician puppets, paying only enough lip-service to the conventional rules of politics to keep the voters quiet.&#10;&#10;Party scandals shamelessly arranged, press campaigns against innocent politicians, filthy intrigues to bring about the fall of opponents, the sudden favoring of surprise candidates better suited to government or to profitable leadership: these unscrupulous power brokers stop at nothing to form tactical coalitions.

304;Evergreen;"Combination of card play and timing from Wolfgang Kramer &amp; Michael Kiesling. There are some recording artists who are famous for singing certain standards. Players are putting on concerts and use numbered cards for each performer to take control of that singer. The singers are represented by old fashioned 45s, with a disc in the center showing values from 5 to 12. Each time a singer is transferred from control of one player to another, the disc is rotated, so the value can rise to 12, but next move, it drops to 5 again. You try to gain control of an artist at high value, or pass artists from one player to another to make them devalue. Scoring occurs when players choose to put on concerts at the end of their turn, including a gala show which doubles the value. The game rules state that the designers produced this game by phone and fax, without ever meeting. Perhaps that shows, as it has interest, but the game uses a sand-timer to apply pressure to your decisions.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.54669;1.8571
305;Der Fliegende HollÃ¤nder;"Early Klaus Teuber game with a well deserved reputation, from a publisher better known for electronic games! The odd combination of mechanisms is a bit tricky to grasp at first, but soon reveals a nice contest. There are various ships in different colors marked on the board and players are dealt 3 random cards to show a share in three of the ships. Also on the board are treasure chests with rising values, and colored markers for each ship move from chest to chest, showing the worth of that vessel. Players begin with cash, 3 Smithy &amp; 3 Trade card, and some lucky horseshoes that they keep on a rack hidden from the other players. These are variously numbered and two dice are rolled at each turn to provide the lucky number.&#10;&#10;As the Flying Dutchman sails the seven seas, it can either move onto islands or the ships. If it is moved onto a ship, players reveal if they are share holders and pay the current value back to the bank as its marker is moved down to zero. On your turn, you can opt to use your Trade card to exchange 2 of your share cards, effectively dodging the Dutchman's threat. Or you can play a Smithy card, to allow you to take horseshoes at the end of the turn. But mainly you can attempt to control the Dutchman's move, by secretly laying down horseshoes to match the lucky number, the closest winning control. A nice rule, if there's a tie, the players are meant to try to agree, then barter, and finally compete with more horseshoes (all to the benefit of the Smithy card players!). Played horseshoes are pooled until Smithies divy them up.&#10;&#10;If the Dutchman is moved to an island, the controlling players reveal a share card and take the value of that ship from the bank. The round ends with all the chest markers moving up once, including a black marker, which ends the game when it reaches the highest chest. Players reveal their share cards and take the final value on the chests, most money wins.&#10;&#10;Puzzling to begin with, but you quickly realize whether your shares are under threat from a Dutchman's move, so you either trade out or try to gain control. If you're not under threat, it may be worth use your Smithy to grab the pool of horseshoes. Get your timing right and the whole thing becomes very rewarding. Simple choices, not perfectly balanced, but the players at times co-operate or struggle, making for an entertaining voyage.&#10;&#10;Winner of the 1992 Deutscher Spiele Preis.&#10;&#10;";1992;6.07563;2.4762

Each player wages his campaign through careful management of ever changing resources, bluffs, and current events on a state-by-state basis to the climactic final days of the conventions and his or her party's nomination.

308;Santa Fe;"Each game is made up of rounds. A round begins with all players playing one card from their hands and placing it face down on the table. Then, all cards are exposed simultaneously.&#10;&#10;There are 66 City Cards and each carry a name of a city along with a number value (ranging from 2 to 7). Since the trains begin their expansion from the easternmost part of the board, the farther west the city, the higher its number value. Players score points only for City Cards that are played and placed face up. Cards that remain unplayed in hands have no value. The numerical value of a City Card is multiplied by the number of railroads connected to it.&#10;&#10;Players may also play a Double turn Card, a combination of a City Card with a Branch Line card or a combination of a Double Turn Card and a Branch Line Card.&#10;&#10;A Double Turn Card allows a player to place two pieces of track in both track phases of a turn (although only one piece of track may be placed if desired). Furthermore, all bonuses are doubled during the round that card is played.&#10;&#10;Each Railroad has two Branch Line Cards and a player may pay $1 and draw one of them. (Players may only hold one Branch Line Card in their hands at any one time.) If held, the Branch Line Card must be played immediately on the next round in conjunction with either a City or Double Turn Card.&#10;&#10;Play of a Branch Line Card allows a player to start a new route of track for the named railroad from any city that railroad connects, thereby extending the railroad.&#10;&#10;After exposing a card, the round continues with two turns of laying track. Players do not control any specific rail line. Each player can place track on any color provided that the played track connects to an existing corresponding rail network on the board. Once all track is placed, all players replenish their hands (up to five cards). The First Player passes the First Player Train to the player on the left (who becomes the First Player for the subsequent round) and the next round begins.&#10;&#10;The first player to connect the first railroad to any city earns $2. Certain cities are marked with colored squares (matching the colors of certain railroads). Should a corresponding color railroad enter that city, the player making that connection gets a bonus of $4. Double Turn Cards double all bonuses in a round.&#10;&#10;When all track pieces of all the railroads have been played or if a player is unable to play any piece of track because all playable railroads are &quot;dead-ended&quot;, the game ends and points are tallied.&#10;&#10;Points are received in two ways. First, players receive 1 point for each $1 they have. Second, each City Card is worth its value times the number of different rail lines connected to it. The player with the highest total wins! (In case of a tie, the player with the most City Cards valued at &quot;7&quot; is declared the victor.)&#10;&#10;";1992;6.94839;2.2
310;Wizard's Quest;"A Heroic Fantasy Wargame wherein Peacemaker the Wizard, tired of eons of conflict over rulership of the island kingdom of Marnon, sets up a quest competition to choose the rightful ruler and end all bloodshed forever.&#10;&#10;The map portrays the island of Marnon divided into 36 numbered territories and 8 bordering castle spaces. Orcs are placed in approximately 1/3rd of these spaces, then players place their Men in the remaining spaces. An opposing player places your 3 Magic Items around the map for you to find later. The first player to collect all three of their own treasures is the winner.&#10;&#10;Each turn, Orcs around the board repopulate and then frenzy, indiscriminately attacking nearby Men. The Dragon flies around and eats Orcs and Men. Peacemaker the Wizard visits a region and bestows prosperity, and also enforces peace there that turn. After all this, each player may petition the Wizard for a card, receive reinforcements, and then carry out an attack campaign. Players forces include Men and two 'superpower' counters: Hero and Sorcerer.&#10;&#10;Garret J.

314;Highlanders;"Rheingold is basically a Castle Risk-style game without the dice combat. The board depicts, rather fetchingly, eighteen castles on or near the Rhine. These are given point values depending on their size or importance, ranging between 1 and 3. The castles are linked to numerous movement areas by tracks meaning that some of the castles are in powerful positions (especially those providing or guarding a river bridge) and others are stuck out on a limb. At the start of the game, the castles aren't owned by anyone and the winner of the game is the one with the most points of captured castles at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;";1993;6.1844;2.0
316;Chase;"Each player starts Chase with a row of nine dice on their side of the hexagonal game board, with the faces of those d6s adding up to 25. On a turn, a player moves a die as many spaces in a straight line as the value showing on the die's face. A die can't move through another piece, but it can wrap around the side of the board and it can bounce off the front or back wall at an angle to move its full distance.&#10;&#10;If you land a die on an opponent's die, that second die is removed and the value of that die added to the lowest die on the opponent's team, keeping their pip count at 25. (If a die reaches 6, you add any remaining speed to what is now the lowest die.) If you land on one of your own dice, you bump that die one space in the same direction, possibly leading to another bump or a capture.&#10;&#10;Instead of moving, if you have two dice next to one another, you can spend the turn adjusting their values while keeping their sum the same. If, for example, you have a 2 and 5 adjacent to one another, you can change them to 1 &amp; 6, 3 &amp; 4, 4 &amp; 3, 5 &amp; 2, or 6 &amp; 1.&#10;&#10;The center of the board has a chamber on it. You cannot move a die through the chamber. If you land a die on the chamber, you split the value of that die on two dice as evenly as possible. (You start the game with one spare.) Those dice emerge from the chamber on spaces adjacent to it, possibly resulting in bumps or captures.&#10;&#10;If you knock an opponent down to only four dice, then they have a pip count below 25 and they lose the game.&#10;&#10;";1985;6.82064;2.6579

320;Scrabble;"In this classic word game, players use their seven drawn letter-tiles to form words on the gameboard. Each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses.  But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word.  This leads to slightly tactical play, as potential words are rejected because they would give an opponent too much access to the better bonus spaces.&#10;&#10;Skip-a-cross was licensed by Selchow &amp; Righter and manufactured by Cadaco.

322;Tonga Bonga;"In Tonga Bonga, each player pilots a ship around a little group of islands with the goal of visiting four of the five remote islands and returning to Tonga Bonga Bay.&#10;&#10;Winning the race does not win the game, however; what matters is having the most money. Each player has room for three sailors (represented by dice) on their ship, and at the start of a round, in order players decide how much money to offer the sailors who will serve as their captain and first mate that round. (The cabin boy always works for free.) Next, in order players roll their dice, then assign one die to each other ship &mdash; never their own! If you place a die with an equal or higher pip value on a ship where a die already present, you bump that earlier die to a lesser role. (In short, the ships always end up with the highest die in the captain position.) One side of each die has a seasick sailor, who doesn't go to sea that round, so not all ships will necessarily be full.&#10;&#10;Once all the dice have been placed, in order players move their ship, ideally reaching islands before others and leaving one of your tokens there. Whenever you land on an island, you reach $25 from the bank, but you must then pay $5 to each player who landed there ahead of you. At the end of a round, players collect the wages next to the captain and first mate spots holding their dice.&#10;&#10;A player who has visited four islands can return to Tonga Bonga Bay, collecting $10 when they dock there. At the end of that round, the game ends, and whoever has the most money wins.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.49149;1.6818

334;Advance to Boardwalk;"Don't let the name fool you. The game has nothing to do with Monopoly. The name was obviously chosen in an attempt to capitalize on that mega-selling monster.&#10;&#10;There are four tracts of land illustrated on the board, which depicts an ocean-front boardwalk. Each tract of land contains five properties valued from $1 million to $8 million. Each turn, a player rolls two regular dice and one special die. The special die has four sides depicting a color matching one of the land tracts, with the other two sides depicting a 'W' and 'F' respectively. The number rolled on the regular two dice is the amount of money the player can spend on development, while the color depicted on the special die is the tract of land he may build on. Thus, if a player rolled an 8 and a red, he has $8 million to spend on developing buildings in the red tract. He can split this $8 million as he sees fit. For example, he may build a building on the $5 million plot and one on the $3 million plot; or he may opt to build one building on the $8 million plot. Quite a few building options here.&#10;&#10;The 'W' on the special die is a 'wild' color. If it was rolled instead of a color, the player may select which tract he wishes to build on. The 'F' means that a player draws a Fortune card and does not build that turn. Fortune cards allow a player to perform a variety of actions, including constructing extra buildings, moving one of his already placed buildings, removing an opponent's building, etc. A player may play one of these Fortune cards per turn.&#10;&#10;When a player constructs a building and obtains the most buildings on a particular plot, he takes the deed to that property and moves his token along the boardwalk an amount equal to the value of the deed. If a player wrested control of the deed from an opponent, the opponent is then moved back that number of spaces. Buildings are placed on the board in a fashion identical to that used in Manhattan...they are stacked on top of existing buildings. If there is a tie for the most buildings, the player who built first on that plot possesses the deed.&#10;&#10;Some have described this game as 'Manhattan lite', and they're not far off. One certainly has similar thought processes and must constantly keep an eye out for optimum plays which will wrest control of deeds (control of buildings in Manhattan) from opponents. There's another planning element thrown in, too. Certain spaces along the boardwalk are marked with an 'F'. If a player advances his token to one of these locations, he draws a Fortune card. These cards can be extremely powerful and cause a severe swing in deed controls. Thus, it is not always wise to go for the largest deed acquisition if a lesser gain would allow you to move your token onto an 'F' location. Clever.&#10;&#10;The game continues until one player has placed all of his buildings (sounds a bit like Rheinl&#195;&#164;nder, doesn't it?) or until one player has reached the end of the boardwalk. The player with the highest total value of deeds is the victor.&#10;&#10;";1985;5.42863;1.5278

However, a pawn may leap over any number of pawns that are in a row, either vertically or horizontally. Players alternate making moves until someone wins.&#10;&#10;";1964;5.49584;1.5909
338;Bargain Hunter;"This game illustrates Herr Rosenberg&#039;s talent for unique card games.  The deck is one through nine in six suits, with two of each card (two 1s, two 2s, etc.).  After the initial hand of eight is dealt, players select one card value to collect, which is placed face-up in front of each player.  A fairly standard trick-taking game takes place with the remaining cards, with players following suit if they can.  If you cannot, the card you play can be trump, if you desire.  If two cards of the same suit/value appear, the second can be declared as either high or low.  When a player wins a trick, the cards of the same value they are collecting are placed in his 'good' pile, with each worth one point.  All the rest are put in the 'bad' pile, with each worth minus one point.  However at the end of each hand, you can convert one value of cards from your 'bad' pile onto the 'good' pile.  Of course, if you had enough of them, you'll be collecting that value for the next hand...&#10;&#10;";1998;6.69353;1.8657
340;Frank's Zoo;"This game is played in several hands. In each hand the players try to be the first to get rid of all of their cards. Their scores are based on how early in the hand they get rid of all their cards. There are two ways to play: you can play where all hands are played the same, or you can play the game with changing partners.&#10;&#10;This is a climbing game, similar to The Great Dalmuti, Tichu, and others.  The difference here is that the ranks are different kinds of colorfully illustrated animals. Each is scared away only by certain other animals.  Players set out one to whatever cards of a particular variety, and someone can play onto that pile only if they have more of that animal or an equal number of some animal that can scare it away.

344;Classic Art;"In Classic Art, first released as Members Only, players attempt to predict how many works of art will be present in five exhibitions. The riskier your predictions in a season, the more you score &mdash; but only if you're correct, of course!&#10;&#10;The game consists of 65 cards, with 13 cards in each of five categories; eleven of the cards are &quot;positive&quot; and two are &quot;negative&quot;. At the start of each season, players get a hand of cards (7-11 depending on the player count) and two cards are placed face up from the deck in their respective exhibitions.&#10;&#10;In the first round of the season, players may predict how many works of art will be in an exhibition at the end of the current season by placing 1-2 tokens (along with their high risk token) on a prediction space. Each exhibition allows you to bet on whether the art will be rare (bet spaces 1-4) or plentiful (bet spaces 5-8). In each subsequent round, a player must place two cards from their hand in the appropriate exhibitions, then they may place a prediction. They may place only one &quot;double token&quot; prediction in a season, and predicting is optional. When all players have only three cards in hand, they each discard one face down, then place the other two cards in exhibitions. Whenever a negative card and positive card appear in an exhibition, remove them.&#10;&#10;At the end of a season, players score for correct predictions. If art in an exhibition is &quot;rare&quot;, i.e., four or fewer works, then all plentiful bets fail, and vice versa. What's more, a rare bet succeeds only if the number of works is equal to or fewer than the bet, e.g., if you bet 3, then you succeed only if three or fewer works of art are present. A plentiful bid succeeds only if the number of works is equal to or more than the bet. The riskier the bet, the higher the payout per token in that successful bet, with players recording points separately for each exhibition.&#10;&#10;At the end of a season, tokens on failed bets (other than the high risk ones) are removed from play, while tokens on successful bids are returned to players. If a player has zero or one tokens at the end of a season, all of their tokens are returned to them.&#10;&#10;A player can score at most 10 points in an exhibition. Continue playing seasons until at the end of a season, each exhibition has at least one player who has scored 5 points in it. The game ends at the point, and players tally their scores &mdash; but tokens in the 0-4 range in an exhibition are worthless. Whoever scores the most points wins!&#10;&#10;In Members Only players bet on odd things like how many royal scandals will happen in a month, and in Glenn's Gallery, another version of this design, players bet on the number of customers who will show up to look at types of art, but otherwise gameplay is nearly identical to Classic Art. The only difference is that each player has a dedicated &quot;double bid&quot; token instead of being allowed to bid two tokens once per season.&#10;&#10;Classic Art includes a two-player variant that can be used in prior releases. After dealing eleven cards to each player, set up a ten-card &quot;house&quot; deck. On each player's turn, they play the top card of the house in addition to two cards from their hand. In the last round, play the final two cards from the house along with the chosen two cards from both players.&#10;&#10;";1996;6.59424;2.087

Three wagons carry goods from one city to another. No-one owns the wagons or controls any of them single-handedly, and in principle a player can put commodities on any transport. There are six different commodities - salt, iron, wine, silk, cloth and food - all of limited supply.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to make money by delivering goods to the towns, and use the money to buy increases in status.  The game ends after a certain number of deliveries have been made and the winner is the player with the highest level of status.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.7325;3.0131
350;Hattrick;"extrapolated from the Game Cabinet:&#10;&#10;A card game with an unusual rule where two tricks can be opened at the same time&#10;&#10;The player to the left of the dealer starts by playing any one card. Now each player follows in clockwise order playing a card, until everybody played one. The second player has the option to play either a card with the same color, or to open a second trick by playing a card of an different color next to the already played card. When someone plays a second color, he starts a second trick on the table. If the second player started a second trick, the third player just has the options to follow either one of the colors or discard a card of the third color (pass). He may not place a card of the third color on one of the existing tricks or start a third trick. If the second player followed the color of the first card, the third one has the option to start a 2nd trick (and so on).&#10;&#10;The players who played the card with the highest number in the respective trick win the respective cards. They place them visible to everyone in front of themselves on the table, stacked by colors, so everyone can see which color they are collecting. The player with the highest card in both tricks starts to play a card for the next round&#10;&#10;After all rounds are completed highest score wins.&#10;&#10;3rd and 4th version of Sticheln by the same game designer allow to play Hattrick, too. It is explained in the rules book as a variant.&#10;&#10;1997 Mensa Select&#10;&#10;";1995;6.4915;1.5652
352;Trumpet;"In this light, short trick-taking game, there are six suits with cards numbered one through eleven, plus 3 wild cards. If you take a trick, you advance your scoring token, however each scoring space can only be occupied by one person, jumping the piece[s] immediately ahead of you. In addition, there are certain spaces which allow that player to set one of the suits as trump. Eventually all the suits are established as some form of trump, however each of them is ranked top to bottom. Once one of the players enters the home stretch of the scoring track, players can chose to move the leaders back a space instead of moving themselves up, but the winner is the player who crosses the finish line first.&#10;&#10;Won Games Magazine Game of the Year award in 1991.&#10;&#10;";1990;6.23365;1.4355
354;Stick 'Em;"In the trick-taking card game Stick 'Em, first released as Sticheln, players seek to gather points each hand by taking as many cards as possible of all but one color, while trying to avoid cards of one color of their choosing.&#10;&#10;In more detail, at the beginning of each hand, each player simultaneously selects and reveals one card from their hand, with the color of this card representing their &quot;pain&quot; color. At the end of the hand, each card of this color that they've collected (including their initial choice from their hand) is worth negative points equal to the card's face value. Each card of another color that this player has collected is worth 1 point.&#10;&#10;To play out the hand, the active player leads a card, then each other player in clockwise order plays one card. If all cards are of the same color, then whoever played the highest card collects these cards, then leads the next trick; if all cards are not of the same color, then whoever played the highest card of a color not initially led collects these cards, then leads the next trick. (One exception: A zero card can never win a trick.) In effect, each color played in a particular trick that doesn't match the color of the card led is considered a trump card, and the highest trump wins. In the event of a tie, the earlier played card breaks the tie.&#10;&#10;Play as many hands as the number of players in the game, summing each player's points over those hands to determine a winner.&#10;&#10;Some versions of Sticheln allow for play with up to six players, while the third and fourth German editions of the game include enough cards to allow for play with up to eight players. (These versions also allow players to play the game Hattrick by the same designer, with rules for this game included as a variant.)&#10;&#10;";1993;7.04648;1.9038
356;Ab die Post!;"A race game that has players flying around the course, avoiding the storm cloud, doing repairs and maybe picking up a passenger for bonus points. The game has a black plastic storm cloud with a little clear cap into which you put colored balls and a black ball. Players draw cards to help them do repairs, then fly the course choosing when to take the outside, middle or inside lane. Shake the storm cloud and see which color ball falls into the cap. The color sets the speed at which you fly, but if black appears you are forced to land and do repairs, by paying back cards. If you are on the inside lane, the shortest course, you pay the most.&#10;&#10;";1996;5.30783;1.3158
360;Quests of the Round Table;"from Game Report Online Review:&#10;&#10;The game comes with two decks of cards. The story deck determines what happens on each player's turn; a quest, a tournament, or a special event. The adventure deck holds the allies, foes, weapons, tests, and amour cards which get dealt and drawn into players' hands. Players begin the game as squires with a lowly battle strength of five and, by earning shields, try to be the first to progress through knight and champion knight to become a knight of the round table&#10;&#10;";1995;5.42668;1.8387
362;Elefantenparade;"Players have 2 elephants each which move along the track, collecting mahogany logs if possible. You can either move any 3 elephants 1,2 &amp; 3 spaces in any order, or you can move all the elephants in a parade forward one place. The logs are on certain squares, so you try to move the other elephants so that yours land exactly onto the logs, without getting detached from the parade. Other squares are water, which lock the elephant down until all have passed, unless you have a parade and everyone moves forward one. At the end of the track are three palaces with more logs for the first, second and third elephants home. Most logs wins. A lovely game with Indian graphics and neat wooden elephants.&#10;&#10;";1988;5.78868;1.3333
364;Samarkand;"A trading game in which you don't trade with the other players.  Instead the commodities are displayed on the board in a number of &quot;nomad camps.&quot;  If your move brings you to a camp, you must present a gift to the camp -- then you can trade your cards for any cards in the camp.  You can also buy goods from the deck at &quot;oasis&quot; squares.  Once you've amassed a number of a particular commodity, you head for the city where that commodity is bought.  There are a few other details to complicate matters, but basically everyone repeats this process until someone has the 500 cash in hand to win the game.  Samarkand is an entertaining exercise with no especially brain-taxing strategies to figure out and makes a good family game.&#10;&#10;This game is sometimes called Bazaar II, because Schmidt Spiele originally published this game under the name Bazaar, even though Bazaar is a completely different game.  Both games are by Sid Sackson.&#10;&#10;";1980;6.40242;1.9375
366;Viva Pamplona!;"In this fluffy, dice-intensive game set in Pamplona, Spain, players control 3-runner teams competing in the running of the bulls.  By rolling the dice and moving their runners (the most significant decisions are which runners to move, and how far to move them when a choice is available), the players try to keep their teams in front of and as close to the bull as possible, while pushing other runners into more cowardly locations.  The reason for all this is that after all players have had their turns, there's a chance that Toro will attack, and the players whose runners are in the most dangerous positions will score the most points.&#10;&#10;";1992;6.36903;1.3725
368;Relationship Tightrope;"This game is a relative of the Raj/Hols der Geier family of games, the german title means Tightrope.  Each turn, a number of red and blue sticks are up for grabs.  The highest card played will take the blue sticks and the lowest card will take the red sticks.  The trick is that a red stick cancels a blue stick (that is, a well balanced tightrope walker), and the goal is to score as few points as possible.  However, there are two different ways of playing the game, depending on how players wish to play: strategic or otherwise.  The basic game has players simultaneously playing cards (ala Raj), whereas the strategic version plays like a trick-taking game with players selecting a card sequentially.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Yin Yang/Fifty-Fifty&#10;&#10;&#10;";1999;6.184;1.3333
370;El Grande: KÃ¶nig & Intrigant;"This expansion for El Grande replaces two different elements from the original game, the action cards and the turn-order cards, with a single set of cards.  Prior to the start of the game, players cull their personal play decks to thirteen. Then each turn, they each select one of their cards, which will dictate their turn order priority, the number of caballeros to add to their court, the number of caballeros eligible to add to the board, and their action.&#10;&#10;This expansion is included in both the 10th Anniversary Edition (Decennial) of El Grande, as well as The El Grande Expansions, and El Grande Big Box&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    El Grande: K&#195;&#182;nig & Intrigant &#226;&#128;&#147; Player's Edition&#10;    El Grande: K&#195;&#182;nig & Intrigant &#226;&#128;&#147; Unverk&#195;&#164;ufliche Sonderkarten&#10;&#10;&#10;";1997;7.44539;3.0704
372;Schotten Totten;"In Schotten Totten, nine boundary stones lie between you and your opponent.  In front of each, you build poker-like formations of three cards on a side.  Whoever plays the higher-ranking formation wins the stone.  And in a unique twist, you may use your powers of logic to claim a stone even before your opponent has played all three of his cards, by demonstrating that the stone is impossible for him to win.  Successfully claim five stones, or any three adjacent stones, and you win the game.&#10;&#10;In 2000 GMT published a rethemed version as Battle Line which includes an extra 10 &quot;tactics&quot; cards that modify the standard game play, and with cards that run from 1 to 10 (instead of 1 to 9).&#10;&#10;The 2004 Edition of Schottentotten has these &quot;tactics&quot; cards too.&#10;Schotten-Totten FAQ.&#10;&#10;";1999;7.36267;1.6861
374;Colorado County;"In this unique game, players buy plots of land on a large, grass-covered board. After a random-like placement of twelve placement markers, the players simultaneously bid for cards which will allow the players to put control markers on the board in the positions indicated on the cards. However, only three cards are available, so only the top three bidders will receive a prize. As if the pressure wasn't enough, players receive a supply of bidding chips (called cowboy tiles) at the beginning of the game, which are only replenished by bidding lowest or zero (missing out on a card/placement) or by selling an owned plot (only 4 or 5 sales per game).&#10;&#10;Some of the plots that the players own will score differently, depending on the timing. At the beginning of the game, border plots are the key; later in the game, control of lakes and large masses of tokens are at a premium. The scoring values vary over the 4 rounds considerably.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.16557;2.4706
376;DruidenWalzer;"In this brain-burner from the Kosmos two-player series, players try to protect their own trees and steal their opponents'. Each player has four trees, all of which are inhabited by tree spirits (cards). Playing spirits (cards) from their hands causes the 'Druid's Dance', and the cards move around the circle of trees, possibly hurting or helping each side in the following contest of strength between matching druids. The game is won when either player has captured two of his opponents trees either through successful druid contests or because a tree has lost all of its tree spirits.&#10;&#10;Druidenwalzer is part of the Kosmos two-player series.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.87676;2.381
378;Lancashire Railways;"Lancashire Railways is a train game about the birth of the first commercial railroads in Central England in 1829. The Silicon Valley of its day, Manchester was the hub of advanced engineering and manufacturing. Liverpool was the largest port and Manchester needed access for its exports of Cloth and Machinery. Lancashire Railways is set in this era of unrestrained growth and development. Each player starts a railway, and attempts to acquire right-of-way at auction. Players may finance their acquisitions with loans from the Bank, although the interest rate may become exorbitant.&#10;&#10;Lancashire Railways is the first game in the Early Railways Series and is the progenitor of later Wallace titles such as Age of Steam and Railroad Tycoon.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.89167;3.1429
380;Polarity;"Once rare and mysterious, now thankfully back in print, Polarity is a 2-player game using lots of magnets (so keep it away from credit cards, watches and so on). The plastic coated pieces look like Reversi/Othello discs, with black and white faces. Each piece contains a magnet, with the black side being North and the white side being South. Each player gets a stack, one plays black one plays white. A neutral red piece goes in the center of the game cloth and players start by place five each of their stack around the cloth. These flat pieces are the foundations.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you take one piece from your stack into your hand, then bring it to bear against one of your foundations. You keep your color face up, so the opposing polarity bears against your foundation piece. This way, you can very carefully balance your new piece in the air against the foundation stone! This is just fantastic to see. The board fills up with lots of discs teetering at 45 degrees, ready to fly about if the balances are upset.&#10;&#10;Get it right and your stack is one piece smaller. Make a mistake and  your turn ends. Either a piece falls flat somewhere (becoming a new foundation) or pieces jump together making towers or into your hand. Your opponent takes the tower you accidentally made and places it their side up where they like. Towers get you points at the game end.&#10;&#10;If a piece jumps to the stone in your hand, they both go back on your stack. The game ends when one player finishes their stack and points are calculated based upon towers and discs remaining. Causing the red piece to jump to another loses you the game outright.&#10;&#10;To be honest, the scoring matters less than the tension and joy of watching the natural but weird force of magnetism at play. Because the discs are discs, they can easily roll around, causing domino effects. Because the towers increase the magnetic pull, they make it so much harder to find a safe spot to play.&#10;&#10;If you want a strange fun game to amaze your friends and family, Polarity is hard to beat. If you want a serious 2-player game, you may prefer other abstracts. The rules could do with being shorter and simpler. Otherwise, a joyous game.&#10;&#10;Comment from the designer &quot;Polarity began as a sculpture. Polarity is zen. It represents that point where absolute opposites merge. In this case, the poles of the magnetic field. The quality of play is determined by one's ability to perceive balance in the midst of extremes. Each game is unique and can never be reproduced. It is in that uniqueness that I was awarded a patent from the U.S. Pat. &amp; Trdmks. office for magnetic principle. The strategy must be viewed 3-dimensionally. It is not just control of a 2-dimensional board but must include the space above and below the playing surface.&quot;&#10;&#10;";1986;6.34809;1.6814
382;Heimlich & Co.;"The game board in Heimlich &amp; Co. is an oval movement track, with points allocated to the various spaces. Seven differently colored &quot;spies&quot; are placed on the board. On a player's turn, they roll a die, then move any combination of characters forward that number of spaces. The newly-moved spies then score points based on their new location. However, the trick here is that each player's color isn't known until the end of the game, so players are encouraged to deduce which color belongs to whom.&#10;&#10;Heimlich &amp; Co. includes advanced rules which allow players to score more points at the end of the game for correctly guessing everyone's identity.&#10;&#10;(&quot;Heimlich&quot;, by the way, is a German adjective meaning secretly or slyly.)&#10;&#10;";1984;6.46976;1.4745
384;TurfMaster;"Turfmaster is a horse-racing game for two to eight players, played over a &quot;meet&quot; of three races.  The board is two-sided, and hurdles are provided so that players can choose flat racing or steeplechases (races with fences that the horses must jump).&#10;&#10;Players each have their own deck of 32 movement cards, dice and a horse of their own colour.  Ten cards are randomly selected for each race, with two cards left over which can be drawn for use in any one race.  Cards played in a race are removed from the game.&#10;&#10;A round consists of two parts.  First all players simultaneously select a card and move the number on the played card (if able), in position order.  After this, a single pair of dice is rolled by one player (the rolling player rotates throughout the game).  The player rolling the dice decides if all horses move the value of one or both of the dice and all horses move (again in position order).&#10;&#10;Like a real horse race, inside position is important.  The game has rules for lane changing, blocking and handicaps on the leaders which restrict the values of the cards the players whose horses are in the first three spots are able to play, or how much (or even IF) a horse in one of those spots can move on a dice roll.  To try to counter this, players have &quot;joker&quot; cards which can be used to avoid being handicapped when in one of the first three spots.  The steeplechase introduces additional rules for jumping fences.  Horses can be forced to pull up short of a fence (because they are blocked on the other side and have nowhere to land safely) or can occasionally fall if their movement ends on a fence - which takes four movement points to jump.  Players will need to plan their moves carefully to prevent other players from getting their full amount of movement, and to avoid having players doing that to them.&#10;&#10;The first four horses to finish each race are awarded points towards their final total.&#10;&#10;The game comes in two versions.  The regular version which has single-colour plastic horses, and the &quot;DeLuxe&quot; version which has hand-painted pewter horses (each jockey wears a different coloured jersey) - each in a little protective case.   In addition, several other tracks are available - there are two course collections which can be purchased separately and a third (web-published) collection.&#10;&#10;";1998;7.24914;1.949

388;Finale;"Another game in Kosmos two-player series, this game casts players as soccer (football) coaches on opposite teams.  Players use special square cards to represent the players they have in each of the positions: strikers, mid-fielders, defenders, and goalies.  Each turn, one of the two players will be the offense based on a simultaneous selection of cards from their respective play books.  Then players allocate their players to the current play, which rotates the used players.  A player card has a number of soccer balls on each edge, which tells how many skill points the player will contribute to a given play, and using the player (thusly rotating him) might actually weaken him for the next use.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented as:&#10;&#10;    Tooor!&#10;&#10;&#10;";1998;5.74142;1.8611

Building on his first real time card game, Falling, which was multi-player with a dealer, he created Brawl, a two-player card game with no dealer.&#10;&#10;Summary: Brawl is a lightning-fast combat game where two players burn through their 35-card decks in about 35 seconds. Each deck contains a unique mix of cards, and each deck requires a slightly different playing style to win.&#10;&#10;Mechanics: Each player takes one deck, sets a &quot;base&quot; card on the table, and begins to play. Players play their cards (Hit, Block, Clear, etc.) as fast as they like, trying to win each Base by playing more Hits on their own side. At the bottom of both decks are three Freeze cards. When every base is Frozen, the game is over.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.36584;1.3661
394;Kahuna;"&quot;Who will rule the South Seas? Two Kahuna - ancient sorcerers of the Pacific - compete for dominance on an archipelago consisting of twelve small islands. Using their magic and wisdom, they struggle for control of the islands. They anxiously await the cards handed to them by fate. But when the time is right, they move to capture one, two, or even more islands, trying to gain the upper hand. At the mercy of the magical powers of the South Seas, they quickly realize that even the best magic is no good without strategy.&quot;&#10;&#10;Originally published in 1997 as Arabana-Ikibiti by the designer's own publisher Bambus Spieleverlag, then reprinted by Funagain in the U.S., Kosmos' Kahuna &ndash; part of its Kosmos two-player series &ndash; is the best known implementation of this design.&#10;&#10;It's a two-player game, played on a board depicting twelve islands. Players use cards to place bridges between these islands or remove opponent's bridges. If you get the majority of bridges around an island, you place one of your marker stones on it and also remove any of your opponent's bridges to that island &ndash; which might cause them to lose a bridge majority on an adjacent island and lose a marker stone there.&#10;&#10;The game is played in three rounds. A round ends when all cards from the face down deck and the three face up cards have been taken. Then points are scored for the islands with a marker stone on them. The game can also end sooner when one player has absolutely NO bridges left on the board.&#10;&#10;The Kosmos edition has excellent graphics and nice wooden pieces and plays very well.&#10;&#10;Reimplements:&#10;&#10;     Arabana-Ikibiti&#10;&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;     Kanaloa&#10;&#10;&#10;";1998;6.61251;2.0542

Similar to Kramer&#039;s other creations, 6 Nimmt! and Hornochsen, players are putting positive and negative cards into groups and either trying to take the resultant points, or avoiding the subject all together.

398;Wildlife Safari;"Wildlife Safari was originally published by AMIGO as Flinke Pinke. This game is one of those 'painfully simple' Reiner Knizia games. There are five different colored chips, with six cards, zero through five, in each of the colors.  The cards are dealt out, and then players take turns playing a card and taking any available chip.  When one color has all six cards played on it, then the game is over, and players use the last card played in each category to value their chips.  The highest total value wins.&#10;&#10;Description of 1994 Milton Bradley re-issue Quandary, for 2-4 players:&#10;&#10;A game of placement, shares and nerve by Reiner Knizia, this is a lovely edition with nice, heavy tiles akin to Mah-jong pieces in weight and feel. Players in turn lay numbered pieces on tracks curling to the centre, and then take a share in any colour. The round ends when a track is filled. Scoring is based on your total share multiplied by the value of the final tile played on each track. So if you are collecting blue shares, I'll try and lay a blue 1 as near last as possible. Then you'll want to play a blue 5 to raise your possible score, but must take a share in a different colour. Same game, different production.&#10;&#10;Description of 2003 Fantasy Flight Games re-issue, Loco!, for 2-4 players:&#10;&#10;Here is the FOURTH version of the game that was originally Flinke Pinke only this time, the added &quot;rule&quot; is that whenever you play a card with a value of &quot;0&quot;, you must say &quot;Loco!&quot; aloud or forfeit your opportunity to select one of the colored chips.  Apart from that, the game is identical.&#10;&#10;Description of the 2010 Eagle-Gryphon Games games re-issue, Botswana, for 2-5 players:&#10;&#10;This fifth version of the game adds a safari theme. Rules and gameplay are unchanged from the original version (no rules about animal noises), but the chips are replaced by plastic animal figures and the cards are covered in matching animal fur patterns.

410;D'raf;"The object of the game is to be the first to drive your car off the side of the table. A road which has as many lanes as contestants is constructed from a number of gray road tiles. Each turn, players select a card from 2 to 10, which is the number of spaces they're moving. After these are revealed remembering that players cannot duplicate a card played by someone previous, players move forward down the road. Each of the cards allows for a certain number of road tile placements from your supply, a number of maneuvers per turn, and the damage your current speed will inflict should you careen into another car. Additionally, a percent of the tiles have special actions associated with them, which give the car on them the ability to jump, or hit a semi-truck, or skid out of control, or just plain slow down 'cuz there's a Smokey comin' on his flipside... The game is over when a car reaches the edge of the table, which gives the game a variable ending.

By skillful use of cards, each player tries to be the first to get back to London.&#10;&#10;This is an action game without dice. Using cards representing different travel modes, players try to use as many of their cards as they can. Playing all of ones cards during a turn, allows one a bonus move.&#10;&#10;";1986;5.98629;1.6538
416;A to Z;"Each player receives a plastic board with 25 spaces on it labeled A to Z (with X and Y sharing a space). The playing board has spaces marked 15, 30, hand and 2. Each player takes a turn moving the single pawn around the board. Once you land on a space, another player draws a card (each with 6 categories on them), looks up your die roll on that card and reads the corresponding category. If you landed on a 15 or 30 you have that many seconds to think of as many words in that category as you can and for each word you can come up with, you cover the appropriate space on your plastic board with a chip. The aim is to be first to fill all 25.&#10;&#10;If you land on a hand, you get 15 seconds and choose another player. For every word you think of you can pull a chip off of their board that starts with the appropriate letter. If you land on the 2 space you can cover 2 spaces on your board for free (handy for Q and X, Y, Z).&#10;&#10;The timer is obnoxiously loud by intent (very distracting) and flips over very suddenly, scaring people who aren't used to it, to mark the end of the time limit.&#10;&#10;Basically, this is a very simple word enumerating party style game that's quick and easy to learn and frustrating for people with poor vocabularies or stalled minds.&#10;&#10;Many years ago, while still known as Nelospelit, Tactic already used the title Ord Mani for an earlier word game; these are different games, although some similarities do exist.&#10;&#10;";1992;6.11365;1.5
420;Rail Baron;"Rail Baron is one of the earlier train games - boardgames with a railroad theme.&#10;&#10;Players move trains along historical USA railroad lines and collect delivery payoffs. They compete to purchase the railroads in order to assemble a network that gives access to important map destinations while simultaneously trying to prevent their opponents from doing so.&#10;&#10;From the Box (Avalon Hill Bookshelf Game)&#10;Only in America!&#10;&#10;You are living in the heyday of the locomotive. You are Jay Gould. And you have just added another railroad to your vast railroad empire. Flushed with success, you now retire to the sartorial splendor of your very own Pullman Palace Car. The dream ends. You awaken to reality with the thought... &quot;just another fantasy.&quot; Ahh, but for the grace of Avalon Hill, you dream continues.&#10;&#10;Here, in Rail Baron, you become a latter day Gould, or a Cornelius Vanderbilt, or any of those menacingly infamous moguls whose wizardry and acumen established the criteria for which business success was to be judged in decades to come.&#10;&#10;Rail Baron is played on a large board of the United States RR network. in fact, it comes in three separate boards. Laid end to end, it spell out America and portrays the 28 major rail lines and major cities they connected during the halcyon days of railroading.&#10;&#10;You start with $20,000 - and a train. You make money on trips from city to city. Pretty soon you've got enough money to build up your empire (you can buy the B&amp;O and C&amp;O for just $44,000). More holdings bring more money your way (track rental) from your opponents.&#10;&#10;With many new nuances of strategy, it becomes a game where fortunes see-saw until the last rail baron is bankrupt - or has accumulated the $200,000 needed to win.&#10;&#10;All of this may take 3 to 4 hours. But it's great fun for 3 to 6 people, ages 10 &amp; up.&#10;&#10;";1977;6.63178;2.2647

Players seek to make the most money by buying and selling stock in various rail companies located on a German map. The board itself is actually a fairly abstract hexagonal system, with track tiles placed on top of the hexes.  Players buy and sell stock in various share companies, whose actions are controlled by the majority stockholder.  The stock manipulation aspect of the game is not as brutal as in 1830.  Plus each 18xx title adds new and different elements to the game.&#10;&#10;This game features minor rail companies, layered stock offerings, and the formation of the Prussian railroad from the minor companies.

426;The Battle of the Bulge;"The Battle of the Bulge is an historically correct re-creation of the famous World War II campaign of the same name.  The 101st Airborne Division is hopelessly encircled at Bastogne. The German commander demands surrender. General Anthony McAuliffe replies to the demand with one simple word &quot;Nuts!&quot;.&#10;&#10;The game's scale is 3.2 km (2 miles) per hex; 12 hours per turn.

428;Galopp Royal;"While ostensibly a racing game - a &quot;racing your sedan chair around the gardens of Versailles&quot; game, no less - the heart of Galopp Royal is the auction rounds that precedes each race: a jumble of bluffing, bidding &amp; wild swings of luck.&#10;&#10;";1995;5.89918;1.6316
430;Asterix: Das Kartenspiel;"The year is 50 B.C. Gaul is entirely occupied by the Romans. Well, not entirely... A simple card game themed on the famous comic graphic novels, with indomitable Gauls bashing unfortunate Romans. Players have a set of cards (Asterix, Obelix, Getafix, Cacofonix &amp; Vitalstatistix) numbered 1 to 10, each card having a different combination of 1-4 magic potions to act as a tie-break. A deck of 55 Roman soldiers, ranging from the cook to Crismus Bonus &amp; Julius himself, are competed for in turn. A scoring card is shown, players select their Gaul cards and show them together, highest wins the Roman and discards their winning card. The other players return their cards to their hands to fight again. There are also Pirate cards which reduce your winnings and Dogmatix cards which allow the players to draw from the deck and either keep the card themselves or pass it onto another player. The rank of the Roman increases your score, but combinations of the same rank are worth much more.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    The Gnumies &#10;&#10;&#10;";1990;5.96982;1.1333
432;Take 5;"In 6 nimmt!, a.k.a. Category 5 and many other names, you want to score as few points as possible.&#10;&#10;To play the game, you shuffle the 104 number cards, lay out four cards face-up to start the four rows, then deal ten cards to each player. Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; specifically, each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that's below the card's number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in its row.&#10;&#10;In addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value. After finishing ten rounds, players tally their score and see whether the game ends. (Category 5 ends when a player has a score greater than 74, for example, while 6 nimmt! ends when someone tops 66.) When this happens, the player with the fewest points wins!&#10;&#10;6 nimmt! works with 2-10 players, and the dynamics of gameplay change the more players that you have. One variant for the game has you use 34 cards, 44 cards, 54 cards, etc. (instead of all 104 cards) when you have three, four, five, etc. players. This change allows you to know which cards are in play, thereby allowing you to track which cards have been played and (theoretically) make better choices as to which card to play when.&#10;&#10;";1994;6.97445;1.1916
434;Yucata';"Simple movement game themed on Mayan graphics. Players have 7 cards (numbered 1-5 and 2 actions) and leapfrog their stone down the track. There are initial stones laid on the track and you collect them as you pass. According to their color, you throw stones away at the end, most stones left wins.

436;Canyon;"Canyon is a trick-taking game in which players try to predict exactly how many tricks they will take.  The number of cards in a hand increases and then decreases in size.  A correct prediction gives your marker movement points around a scoring track depicted on a river in a canyon, whose main feature of interest is a section of &quot;rapids&quot; near the finish line where your marker will be &quot;caught in the current&quot; and sent back a few spaces if you go too many hands without a correct prediction.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Bid & Bluff&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Grand Canyon&#10;&#10;&#10;";1997;6.24934;1.5676
438;Scotland Yard;"In Scotland Yard, one of the players takes on the role of Mr. X. His job is to move from point to point around the map of London taking taxis, buses or subways. The detectives &ndash; that is, the remaining players acting in concert &ndash; move around similarly in an effort to move into the same space as Mr. X. But while the criminal's mode of transportation is nearly always known, his exact location is only known intermittently throughout the game.&#10;&#10;The 125 fare tickets are 5 black, 23 pink underground, 43 green bus,  54 yellow taxi.&#10;&#10;Similar to&#10;&#10;    The Fury of Dracula&#10;    Clue: The Great Museum Caper&#10;    Ghost Chase&#10;    Letters from Whitechapel&#10;    Garibaldi: The Escape&#10;    Specter Ops&#10;    Whitehall Mystery&#10;&#10;&#10;";1983;6.50474;1.9443
440;Zoff in Buffalo;"Once a year, Buffalo City goes beef crazy. Cowboys drive their cows here to the biggest auction in the Wild West. The players must attempt to find grazing for their cows on the limited pasture.&#10;&#10;Which beef baron will most cleverly play his cards?&#10;&#10;Players have 10 cards to play which specify a number of cows.  Each round features a simultaneous selection of 2 of the 10 cards and a designation of which of the several pastures (the number of pastures in the game depends on the number of players) you'll try to place the cows in.  The tricky part starts with the rule that no two players can ever have exactly the same number of cows in a given pasture.  So if you plan to put 4 cows in a certain pasture, but somebody else has exactly 4 there already when your turn comes around, you'll only get to put 3 of them in -- and if somebody else has exactly 3 there already, you'll only get to put 2 of them in.  And it's very detrimental to your gameplan if you don't get to play all the cows you're entitled to!&#10;&#10;When a pasture is completely filled with cows, there are bonuses paid in the form of a chance to put extra cows into other pastures, but perversely, the better bonuses go to the players with the second or third most cows, not the first most.  This is the *really* tricky part.&#10;&#10;The game ends after five swift rounds and all 10 of your cards played, maybe half an hour from start to finish. Whoever has the most cows in the pastures wins!&#10;&#10;";1998;6.37039;2.0323
442;Um Reifenbreite;"Translating as &quot;By the Width of a Tire,&quot; this game covers a Tour de France-type of bicycle race.  Each player takes control of a four-member racing team, and the goal is to score as many points as possible for the whole team.  Movement is primarily handled by dice, however a limited card set partially replaces die results.  Once you add unique rules which allow riders to draft one another and multiple kinds of road surfaces, this game has much to offer race fans.&#10;&#10;Homas Tour is the original edition of the cycle racing game later known as Um Reifenbreite. Many copies of the original game were destroyed in a warehouse fire in 1979. The combination of its sudden rarity and recognition as a good game meant that Homas Tour was (and is) very desirable, particularly to collectors. Everyone else can save their money and enjoy Um Reifenbreite!&#10;&#10;";1979;6.77625;1.96
444;Escape from the Hidden Castle;"Although billed as a children's game, Escape from the Hidden Castle, a.k.a. Midnight Party or Hugo, is actually quite enjoyable by adults as a light, fun game. Each player controls a number of guests at a party, with the number of guests dependent on the number of players. These guests start the round in the spaces of the gallery on the game board, one guest per space; this initial placement is a large part of a player's strategy.&#10;&#10;The Phantom (or &quot;Hugo the ghost&quot; in earlier versions) starts in the cellar, then climbs the stairs towards the gallery where the guests circle. The mechanism for the Phantom's movement is simple: On a player's turn, he rolls a special die. If he gets a number, he moves his pieces; if he gets a Phantom, the Phantom moves. This means that with more players in the game, the Phantom moves a lot more frequently, so you must adjust your strategy accordingly.&#10;&#10;Once the Phantom has reached the gallery, the guests can start ducking into rooms adjoining the gallery to avoid him, with only one guest per room! A couple of rooms are special in that they add or subtract extra &quot;fright points&quot; from your score. As the Phantom catches up with the remaining guests, they are sequestered on the stair steps, then in the cellar. The first guest caught &quot;earns&quot; the most fright points, with those caught later in the round earning less and less.&#10;&#10;Once all the guests have been caught, the fright points are tallied. After playing a predetermined number of rounds, the player with the fewest fright points wins!&#10;&#10;";1989;6.23869;1.1314
446;Avalanche;"Players take turns dropping their marbles down the channels of the game, trying to get as many marbles as possible to fall out the bottom.  Impeding the motion of the marbles are several plastic gates.  The gates catch the first marble that hits their top (subsequent marbles roll off) and swing back and forth when a marble hits their base.  Using logic, players deduce which way the gates will move when they drop their marble, and try to make a move that results in the most marbles making it to the bottom of the game (or that blocks a potentially good move by their opponent).&#10;&#10;";1965;5.6875;1.1923
450;Octi;"Octi is a unique abstract strategy game.   Its object is to move your pieces into your opponent's starting points.  Octi  allows for multiple jumping, capturing, and special movement of pieces.  On each move players decide whether to bring in new pieces, upgrade their existing pieces, or move a piece.  The choices in this game are staggering and each move presents and entire new way of thinking about the game.  There is a 4 player teams variant that is included in the rules.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.68;2.963
452;Mummy Rummy;"from a session report:&#10;&#10;This is a rummy based game where you are trying to form sets of Egyptian artifacts, three cards to a set, from a deck of about 50 cards. The quirk here is some cards have two images on them, so they could belong to one of two sets. You score for sets, and deduct points for cards left in the hand.&#10;&#10;";1994;5.05565;1.1905
454;Tante Tarantel;"Tante Tarantel (Auntie Tarantula) scoots round her web, gobbling up your insects as they try to escape. The web is a spiral.  You roll the die to move Auntie, and then take turns to move one of your bugs towards the exit space. Initially, Auntie is in a good mood; if she runs into bugs, they go back to her larder. However, as soon as someone escapes, she loses her temper and kills anything she catches! The game has a scoring track.  Each time a bug is caught or escapes, a marker moves up the track, adding to the die roll and making Auntie run around the web faster and faster. Players can share some spaces, but often bump each other back and forth. Naturally, nasty bugs can push others into Auntie's path to certain death!&#10;&#10;The original set had wooden pawns for the bugs, but D&amp;F issued a series of neat rubber bugs, which add to the game's style.&#10;&#10;";1991;6.18107;1.2667
458;Sherlock Holmes: The Card Game;"With illustrations from the original novels, this card game goes some way to evoke the feeling of the chase through Victorian London to unmask Moriarty and other villains. Players draw and lay cards in sequence, Movement, Location, Info, Action, Detectives and Villains. So I might take a train to the Country, find a clue and use a Disguise. I can use an Inspector, Arrest or Alibi card on my opponents and so on. Play ends either when an Arrest successfully reveals a Villain, or when a player discards their last card, a Villain, who Escapes. Scoring is based on cards remaining in your hand, and if you are the arresting or guilty player, caught with a Villain in your hand.&#10;&#10; Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    I Say, Holmes!&#10;&#10;&#10;";1991;6.1569;1.5
460;Railway Rivals;"This is a classic simple railway racing game, perhaps the first modern railroading game, where you draw the railway lines on hex-board. This one uses the sort of colored marker pens you can wipe off with a damp cloth after the game. The game goes through phases; initially you draw tracks and earn money for linking cities. When a number of cities are joined, you start racing, the cities being chosen randomly. The races are simple dice-rollers and the 1st &amp; 2nd place get prize money. After a couple of races, you draw some more tracks, then race some more and so on.&#10;&#10;The railways cost more if you go over mountains etc, but this gives you shorter routes. You can run parallel to other lines at a cost, or simply link into another player's track and rent the tracks of other players when you race.&#10;&#10;The board has a UK map on one side and a US map on the other, both giving amusing challenges, and the game has good repeat value. The designer David Watts has published a lot of stand alone Railway Rivals maps, and there is another edition of this game, Dampfross published by Laurin.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Dampfross&#10;&#10;&#10;";1979;6.71067;2.325
462;Esels-Rennen;"First issued in 1989 for fewer players, the second edition (released in 1996) is for 2-6 players. The board has two sides, for racing either 3 or 4 colored donkeys. Players are given a card secretly, each showing the donkey's finishing order, a different result for each card. The board shows a patchwork of steps across a field from start to finish, each space with a colored arrow matching the donkeys. When you move a donkey onto a space marked with a green arrow pointing left, you then move the green donkey one space that way. If that space then has a blue arrow pointing right, you next move the blue donkey on one space that way. This goes on until you cannot move the final donkey because it is blocked. Eventually, the donkeys cross the finish line, and the player with the best matching result on their card wins. More of a competitive puzzle than a game, it is a nice diversion, but awkward because the donkeys constantly fall on their sides. Possibly Doris &amp; Frank&#039;s first game and related to their Bunny Zick-Zack.&#10;&#10;3rd Place 1989 Hippodice Spieleautorenwettbewerb (as Donky [sic]).&#10;&#10;";1989;5.5176;1.1667
464;Billabong;"In the geometrical racing game Billabong &mdash; currently available on the market as Billabong Race &mdash; players maneuver teams of kangaroos by jumping around a &quot;billabong&quot;, that is, &quot;a dead-end channel extending from the stream of a river&quot;, with this term being used in Australia. The board is filled with checkerboard-style squares around the billabong in the middle.&#10;&#10;To start, everyone takes turns placing their five kangaroos on an empty square behind the stream that serves as the race's start &mdash; and finish &mdash; line. On your turn, you move one of your five kangaroos, usually moving it in a jump or series of jumps over the other kangaroos. Jumps can be long, but they must take a specific format; for example, if the kangaroo to be jumped over is five spaces away from your current location, your landing space must be five spaces beyond this kangaroo. You can jump over only one kangaroo at a time, but you can make multiple jumps on a turn as long as each jump is along a straight line (whether orthogonally or diagonally) and it does not pass over the billabong. Your other option &mdash; moving a kangaroo just one space &mdash; is usually used as a positioning tactic for a subsequent move.&#10;&#10;The first player to get all five kangaroos around the billabong and over the finish line wins.&#10;&#10;";1992;6.82834;1.8784
466;Inkognito;"Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;The goal of each agent in Inkognito is to complete a mission, together with his partner. At the beginning of the game, however, players don't know which mission they must fulfill!&#10;&#10;In the standard four-player game, each player guides one of four secret agents. The four characters are allied in pairs: Lord Fiddlebottom and Colonel Bubble are always partnered against Agent X and Madame Zsa Zsa. Each of the four agents is represented by one of four different figures, with different builds: tall, short, fat, thin. Only one of them represents the actual character controlled by a player. The other three figures represent spies which are friendly to him and that are trying to confuse the opposition.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player shakes the Phantom of Prophecy randomizer to determine his three available actions, e.g., moving on a land route or a sea route. The player moves his figures, trying to reach spaces already occupied by the other players' figures or the Ambassador. When&#31; figures are in the same space, the current player gets the right to &quot;ask questions&quot; and inspect some of the cards of that player. By deduction and a logical process of elimination, he can draw conclusions as to the identity and intentions of the other players.&#10;&#10;The &#31;first goal of every agent is to discover which of the other players is his partner. This partner has the other half of the &quot;code&quot; indicating his secret mission. After discovering (or thinking he has discovered) the real identity of the other players, an agent must trade his secret mission card with his ally. This will reveal the final mission and what must be done to complete it. If either agent on a team completes the mission, both he and his partner win the game.&#10;&#10;There is another character with an important role in the game: the Ambassador. He can be used to get clearer information about the other characters. Everyone wants to meet him because he is well-informed and can be useful to accomplish your purposes, but he can also help your rivals, so do everything you can to keep him far from them.&#10;&#10;The 2013 version of Inkognito from Ares Games raises the maximum player count to five by allowing someone to play the Ambassador and move it during his turn. He can still gather clues when the other players question the Ambassador during their turn, and the other players can still gather clues from him. The goal of the Ambassador's player is to know everything about the other characters, guessing their identities and builds. If the Ambassador achieves &quot;perfect knowledge&quot; before a team accomplishes its secret missions, he wins the game.&#10;&#10;";1988;6.60869;2.1652
468;Dump;"This is a prototype design about territorial competition between dogs in a neighborhood.  Each player is a dog that tries to have the most prestigious and extensive territory by going around pooping and peeing on streets, lawns, and yards to mark their area.  The center of neighborhood is occupied by the park, the jewel in the eyes of all dogs to claim as their own.  To achieve top dog status players will come across trash cans (for resupply) and fire hydrants that help in scoring more points.&#10;&#10;";0;5.5;1.0
470;Road to the White House;"extrapolated from the preview:&#10;&#10;The essence of the game is that you are moving from one to four pawns around the country, landing in cities, and scoring &quot;votes&quot; in the appropriate state which are proportional to the size of the city. Each turn, you move and add votes to the states you land in.&#10;&#10;There are many complications that can occur. You can sit out a turn and collect money. With money, you can buy &quot;organization&quot; in a state, acting as a multiplier to all subsequent votes you get in that state. You can buy &quot;advertising&quot; - most useful in buying votes in piddly states that you're too busy to visit. You can buy &quot;surrogates&quot; which are additional pawns who may travel, garnering votes, just like your candidate. You can buy &quot;special flights&quot; that help you get to places without the luck of the dice.&#10;&#10;The most characteristic part of the game comes in the &quot;issues&quot;. Each player picks a politician with his own profile on how he stands on various issues. Then either through choice or chance cards, issues become &quot;active&quot;. As long as the issue is active, politicians with a relevant stand will have bonuses or penalties when he visits certain states. The game strongly encourages role playing.&#10;&#10;The climax of the game comes at the end, as you go down each state to see who has the most votes, thereby winning that state's delegates. There is a smart balloting system, in which the lowest scoring player drops out, giving his states' votes to the next strongest in each state. This continues, with players dropping out in each successive ballot until a winner is chosen.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;";1992;6.16313;3.5455
472;DungeonQuest;"Players explore the ruins of Castle Dragonfire trying to reach the treasure chamber in the center of the dungeon and escape alive with as much treasure as possible. A limited number of turns before the game ends puts pressure on players to take risks and score rewards because anyone left in the dungeon when time runs out dies! A tile-laying system creates the maze-like dungeon and ensures that no two games are ever exactly the same.&#10;&#10;Originally published in Sweden as Drakborgen (Dragon Keep) in 1985 by Alga, a subsidiary of BRIO AB.

476;Mr. President;"Part of the 3M Bookshelf Series.&#10;&#10;Mr. President is a highly realistic reenactment of the campaign events which lead to the election of the President and Vice-President of the United States.  The two major political parties choose their candidates from a slate of possible nominees, each of whom possesses varying strengths and weaknesses. In their quest for victory, players feel the same frustrations and make the same decisions that confront actual candidates.  Strategies which were intended to sweep a party into office may suddenly require a drastic change of tactics.&#10;&#10;Mr. President includes Advanced Play rules covering Nominations, Advertising, Fund-Raising, Debates, and Incumbent Candidates.&#10;&#10;In the 2-player game, one player controls the President and Vice President of a party.&#10;&#10;In the 4-player game, two teams of candidates for President and Vice-President compete.&#10;&#10;The 1967 or later copyright date differentiates this version from the earlier 1965/1966 release by 3M, which is an entirely different game.&#10;&#10;NOTE:&#10;There are significant differences between the 1967 version and the 1971 version.&#10;&#10;";1967;6.64162;2.1613
478;Citadels;"In Citadels, players take on new roles each round to represent characters they hire in order to help them acquire gold and erect buildings. The game ends at the close of a round in which a player erects his/her eighth building. Players then tally their points, and the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Players start with a number of building cards in their hand; buildings come in five colors, with the purple buildings typically having a special ability and the other colored buildings providing a benefit when you play particular characters. At the start of each round, the player who was king the previous round discards one of the eight character cards at random, chooses one, then passes the cards to the next player, etc. until each player has secretly chosen a character. Each character has a special ability, and the usefulness of any character depends upon your situation, and that of your opponents. The characters then carry out their actions in numerical order: the assassin eliminating another character for the round, the thief stealing all gold from another character, the wizard swapping building cards with another player, the warlord optionally destroys a building in play, and so on.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player earns two or more gold (or draws two building cards then discards one), then optionally constructs one building (or up to three if playing the architect this round). Buildings cost gold equal to the number of symbols on them, and each building is worth a certain number of points. In addition to points from buildings, at the end of the game a player scores bonus points for having eight buildings or buildings of all five colors.&#10;&#10;The expansion Citadels: The Dark City was initially released as a separate item, but the second edition of the game from Hans im Gl&uuml;ck (packaged in a tin box) and the third edition from Fantasy Flight Games included this expansion and can be recognized by its rectangular box (not square). With Dark City, Citadels supports a maximum of eight players.&#10;&#10;";2000;7.057;2.0473
480;Age of Arguments;"The Age of Arguments is set at the end of the 17th and beginning of the 18th centuries.  It is a simulation of the struggle between the major European states for power in Europe and the emerging empires.  The turn order auction is a nice tweak that really tests your bluffing abilities.

Some perform better in the marshes or in the mountains. Others have powerful death curses that provide long-lasting effects to the battle. There are over 200 different pieces in the universe, each with its special function.&#10; Stratego Legends is an &quot;optionally collectible&quot; game. Each box comes with a light army and a dark army whose pieces have been chosen to work well together. However, there are rules for customizing armies (and the lands they fight upon) to specialize your attack force. There are also rules for multiplayer games where 4, 6, or 8 players can square off as two teams.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.81792;2.2642

Each turn, one player reveals a card that depicts four animals, each in a different color. All players race to figure out the animal and color not depicted on this revealed card, then grab the card on the table showing this colored animal combination.&#10;&#10;This quick, mind-crushing exercise continues until the deck is depleted.

488;Stake Your Claim;"A gold rush themed set collection game with a simple mechanic that enables swift play. There are two variants described, a 2-6 player game as well as a 2-player version outlined in the rules.&#10;&#10;Broad appeal to children and adults due to the clear mechanics and straight-forward play.&#10;&#10;The game utilizes 44 cards in 11 groups of four different images. Players build up their 'stash piles' by 'patenting' as many 'claims' as possible. This is accomplished by collecting sets in multiple stacks by drawing from a draw pile or common pool of 8 tiles in the center of the table based on matches and placing tiles into the pool if no match can be found.&#10;&#10;Matches can also be made with the top card of piles of any other player. The end game comes when all cards are in the possession of the players, and the stacks are consolidated to determine who has the largest stack of claims.&#10;&#10;The 2-player variant involves repeat-dealing of four cards to players when their hands are exhausted by set collection from the pool until all cards from the deck have been utilized.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by: &#10;&#10;    R&#195;&#164;uber&#10;&#10;&#10;";1985;6.00141;1.0

492;Aladdin's Dragons;"After the immediate response to Richard Breese&#039;s Keydom at Essen 1999, Hans im Gl&#195;&#188;ck contracted to take the basic game idea and produce a version of the game.  Aladdin's Dragons, or Morgenland in the original German, is the product of their cooperation.&#10;&#10;The game features players putting numbered bidding chips face-down onto the board sequentially.  After the players have placed all of their chips, then each of the areas is resolved.  The bottom part of the board is where players attempt to gather treasure tokens, which is the overall currency of the game.  The middle part of the board features a number of special actions, which help the players cast spells, trade in their resource tokens, or block other players' actions.  The top part of the board is where players use treasure tokens to purchase artifacts, and the player who can collect the most artifacts by the end of the game will be the victor.&#10;&#10;Won Games Magazine Game of the Year award in 2001.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Keydom&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Aladdin's Dragons (card game version by same name as board game)&#10;&#10;&#10;Microbadges:    (Buy One)&#10;&#10;      Aladdin&#039;s Dragons fan&#10;&#10;&#10;";2000;6.88899;2.3596
494;Ave Caesar;"Set in the Roman stadium Circus Maximus, in Ave Caesar, players use cards to move their chariots around a quasi-variable track. The track itself has bottlenecks and lane-changing restrictions, which make the race interesting for the racers (very similar to Detroit-Cleveland Grand Prix or Daytona 500). Players are required to race three laps, and they must stop to 'Hail Caesar' before they can finish (a pit stop). The game is light, but if you waste too many moves taking the longer, outside-routes on corners, you may not have enough movement to finish the race. Later, the game was revamped into Ausgebremst, with the most notable changes being modular boards and options to reduce the luck.&#10;&#10;The Cafe Games/Pro Ludo edition has only 2 different tracks compared to the Ravensburger edition with 2 track variants on both sides of the board.&#10;&#10;It was re-released in 2022 by DiceTree Games with deluxe components, new maps, and new variants (by the designer).&#10;&#10;";1989;6.64901;1.3588
496;Dilemma;"Dilemma is a curious combination of speed, dexterity, and bluffing. The starting player places a numbered card in an arena (a plastic dish). Players place or apparently throw numbered cards into the arena. If you do this correctly so that your card covers the opener neatly, you then duel with the starter. You each have a dueling block, showing peace or war. Lay this hidden, then reveal them together:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Peace/peace means the players swap the cards in the arena.&#10;    War/peace means war takes all the cards but loses one of ten lives.&#10;    War/war means no one gains cards and both lose a life.&#10;&#10;&#10;If you have no lives, you still duel, but can place only peace.

500;MARK;"MARK is a game about collecting, processing, and reselling recycled components for a profit. Each turn, a player rolls a pair of color dice and chooses one of the showing die colors to perform an action with. Each color is tied to one type of recyclable material. A player can choose to receive a single new recyclable good to his delivery yard, or he can choose to move a single recyclable good from his delivery yard to his treatment area, or he can choose to sell one good from his treatment area to the market grid in the center of the board.&#10;&#10;The market grid has 5 rows, and each row can hold only one variety of recyclable materials. When selling to the market, if it is the first time that good has been sold, the player may choose which row to sell into (left-most position in the row only), otherwise he must sell into the next empty space in the row that variety already occupies. He receives the amount of money shown on the space where he places his recyclable good. When the row is full, all goods of that type are removed from the game. The game ends when four of the market rows are completely filled.&#10;&#10;If the player rolls both dice of the same color, he has no choice in which recyclable material to choose, but may perform two actions (delivery, treatment, or sale) with that type of good. In addition, there are two special symbols on the dice (one on each). One is a star symbol, which acts as a wild. The player can choose whatever color he desires. The other is a gavel, which triggers an immediate auction for the type of good shown on the other die, after which the player takes another turn. The auction is a closed-fist auction.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the player's turn, he must pay 5 dollars in storage fees if he has more than 2 recyclable materials in his delivery yard. He must also pay 5 dollars in storage fees if he has more than 2 recyclable materials in his treatment area. This provides tension between waiting for bigger pay-outs and selling recyclable materials early.&#10;&#10;The player with the most money at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;";1997;6.03226;1.6667

The goal is to have your balls land closest to the mark placed on the board.

506;The Big Cheese;"An auction game in which players bid from their pool of &quot;worker rats&quot; to gain control of corporate projects.  The workers from the winning bid are then are assigned to the project.  Each turn, one worker is removed from each project.  A project is complete once all workers have been removed.  The value of a numbered project is only determined at completion by a die roll. Two other projects, Veto and The Big Cheese, allow special actions during the game. The game has two different scoring schemes, depending on whether players use a single six-sided die or a set of seven polyhedral dice.&#10;&#10;This is part of the Hip Pocket Games series.&#10;&#10;Awards&#10;&#10;1999 Listed in GAMES Magazine's GAMES 100&#10;&#10;";1998;5.8844;1.3455
508;Blue Max;"In &quot;Blue Max&quot;, each player pilots a World War I airplane in a dogfight. This  wargame can be played as a campaign, with new planes becoming available as time passes, and with surviving pilots getting better at what they do.&#10;&#10;Each plane has a maneuver sheet showing which ones it is allowed to do -- some maneuvers can only be executed by ace pilots, and other maneuvers are &quot;restricted&quot; in the sense that they can't be repeated from one turn to the next (the plane would stall).&#10;&#10;If you &quot;tail&quot; another plane, its pilot must show you whether he's going right, left or straight ahead. You get to shoot ahead of your plane, unless you have a bomber with an observer/gunner in the back (swivel-mounted guns). Damage is rolled on a table that determines severity in terms of blue and red hits; you then draw the indicated number of coloued chits from a cup. Hits are taken to the wings, tail, engine, etc. There's a chance the pilot is killed, or that the plane catches fire.&#10;&#10;Fuel eventually runs out and the pilots fly off to meet another day --if they survived. &#10;This is a lot of fun with massive numbers of players; you can put the 20-odd planes on the map at once, balancing the better airplanes with weaker pilots.&#10;&#10;The second edition introduced crude altitude rules, and in 1995 GDW put out full-blown miniatures rules.&#10;&#10;The 2014 edition of Blue Max had substantial changes, and can be found with its own game page HERE.&#10;&#10;";1983;7.17164;2.2673
510;Eschnapur;"Eschnapur is a game where players explore an Indian temple and try to discover the secret treasures hidden within.&#10;&#10;The game is a mixture of a variety of mechanisms; discovery chips, movement tiles, supply tiles and symbol cards. The game board shows a top-down view of the temple, showing a path through the temple off which are many niches holding the treasures. The pathway has stepping stones marked with a variety of symbols, one in front of each. To open the niche you must have the right symbol. To move around, you must spend footprint tiles. To obtain these, the player must reveal 2 supply tiles, keeps one and auctions the other. Players bid with anything they have, tiles, coins, cards.&#10;&#10;Sounds confusing? It is. You must win auctions to get the stuff you need to win more auctions and move and open niches and collect treasures to score points to win the game.  It might take a player a while to figure the true value of all of the items and how it all fits together, but once a player has the idea, the game really works.&#10;&#10;";2000;5.66924;2.3529
512;Holiday!;"In this game, players attempt to guide an airplane around the world as the calendar progresses from day to day.  Players hold a hand of cards, each stating a city and day-of-the-week combination.  Their goal is to have the plane reach their destination as close to their card's day as possible.  (E.g. if I hold &quot;Paris - Tuesday&quot; then I'd like the plane to reach Paris on Tuesday, not on Saturday--it's worth more points that way).&#10;&#10;The method by which the plane moves is based on an auction.  Each round, players bid for the right to choose the plane's next destination (each player starts with a fixed amount of money and cannot earn any money during the game).  Movement is restricted to only adjacent cities.  Sometimes a player will receive a windfall when an opponent pays for the privilege of moving the plane but moves it to a place where it's beneficial to both players.  At other times, a player will see the plane start moving away from the area of the world preferred.&#10;&#10;Play continues until all players are out of money or one player has played all of his or her cards.  Most victory points earned (as the cards are played) determines the victor.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented as:&#10;&#10;    Shanghai&#10;    Maloney&#039;s Inheritance&#10;&#10;&#10;";1973;6.73872;2.0

518;Cat vs. Mouse;"Cat vs. Mouse lets players &quot;Recreate the classic cartoons you grew up with and pound on your friends at the same time!&quot;.&#10;&#10;The game is for 2-4 players and each player gets a &quot;team&quot; of 1 cat and 2 mice. The main object of the game is to get 10 points, mostly by having your mice get food from the refrigerator back into the mouse-hole. The board is the layout of a house with the mouse-hole on one end and the refrigerator on the other end. Your mice try to get food and your cat tries to stop the other team's mice from doing so. There is a dog counter which can be moved each turn, and you use it to try to go after the opponent's cat. In terms of fighting, you can only fight an enemy (The mouse's enemy is the cat, the dog's enemy is the cat, and the cat's enemies are the mice and the dog). You can also pick up items throughout the house that you can use during combat to modify your strength. If you defeat one of your enemies in combat, it is considered &quot;Clobbered&quot; and cannot function until the next turn. Most items give a strength modifier but some items have special effects. In the basic game, you get 4 points for having your mice get a piece of food back to the mouse-hole, and 1 point when your cat clobbers an opponent's mouse. Optional rules include rules for variable points for the different types of food (cheese, drumstick, apple)&#10;&#10;";2000;6.14286;0.0

524;Desperados;"Desperados is a partnership game where players in teams of two must work together to get the most points. In Reiner Knizia&#039;s first published game, there are nine mine-opening cards and nine mine-closing cards.  To score any points you've got to play gold, silver or copper cards onto the corresponding open mine and then close it.  Trouble is, your opponents can close your mine before you want or even try to steal it with bandit cards -- a tough gauntlet to run, but here and there a few points trickle through and into the scoring column.  On your turn you either play a card OR draw a card -- not both -- making this rapid-fire card game move at its own special pace, which is very quickly indeed. It was designed primarily for partnership play, and appreciated best by players with good partnership skills. For players who do not want a partnership experience, there are variations for 2 or 3 players.&#10;&#10;Originally published as Digging by Hexagames in 1990 (Later by Avalanche Press with new pictures on the cards and a trivial rules tweak).

525;Pisa;"from Schloesser session report:&#10;&#10;This is a  trick-taking game, but with enough twists to give it a very different feel. Before each hand, players bid, one at a time, to determine three factors which will affect the hand:&#10;&#10;a) trump colors (primary &amp; secondary) &#10;b) most or fewest tricks &#10;c) whether zero is considered 'high' or 'low'&#10;&#10;Bidding is done by playing cards face-down from your hand. Players must bid 1 - 3 three cards on each of these categories. Once all three factors have been determined, players tally the value of the cards they played during this bidding process. The player who played the least value receives 4 (or 5, depending upon the number of players) victory points, with each other player receiving less points depending upon their total. Then, players must discard three of the cards they used in the bidding process, with the remaining cards being returned to their hands. This is usually a tough choice as often the conditions in effect for a particular hand turn out to be different than what you had hoped. This means that many of the cards you played may no longer be useful to you; indeed, they may be a detriment. So, deciding on which cards to keep and which to discard can be tough.&#10;&#10;After this procedure is complete, A standard trick-taking game ensues. Points, however, are rewarded based on whether the goal was to take the most or fewest tricks. The player finishing with the most (or fewest, depending upon which goal was in force) receives 8 points (or 10 of playing with 5 players), the next player gets 6 points and so on down to 2 points. After a hand is completed, the entire process is repeated, including the bidding phase. A number of rounds equal to the number of players is played, with the player accumulating the greatest number of victory points being the victor.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.33977;1.75
526;Abalone;"This beautiful and functional board has room for two teams of large marbles. Players take turns pushing the marbles around the board, with the goal of pushing six of the opposing player's marbles off the board. The central idea is that a column of marbles has weight given by the number of marbles in line. Someone will need to push with a heavier group of marbles in order to push the column along that axis. However, with six possible directions, it's difficult to defend yourself perfectly. Also, it's possible to play the game with up to six players when supplemental marble sets are purchased.&#10;&#10;A winner of the 1988 Concours International de Cr&#195;&#169;ateurs de Jeux de Soci&#195;&#169;t&#195;&#169;.&#10;&#10;";1987;6.47904;2.1559
527;GIPF;"GIPF is a strategic game for two players based on a classic concept: In turns, players introduce one piece into play until achieving four-in a-row. Players then remove their row and capture any of their opponent's pieces which extend that row. This principle of capturing pieces creates  completely changed situations on the board. The purpose is to form successive rows of at least four pieces, until the opponent has no piece left to bring into play.&#10;&#10;GIPF is not only the name of a game, but of a project as well. This project concerns a group of games and extra pieces that will follow step by step. Each game of the project will be playable either separately, or, by means of extra pieces, in combination with GIPF. It concerns a system that makes winning or losing GIPF-related games a strategic factor of the game GIPF itself.&#10;&#10;This game is part of project GIPF.&#10;&#10;";1996;7.08777;2.7577

This is mostly accomplished by jumping one ball over one or more others, Checkers-style, on a hex board. A player's turn consists of either jumping (which can be forced) or placing any color ball on the board and removing an empty space from the edge of the board. In this manner, the play space continually shrinks, giving the endgame an almost claustrophobic feel.&#10;&#10;This game is part of project GIPF.&#10;&#10;";1999;7.26969;2.7361

The game was later re-released as the slightly modified Krieg und Frieden (War and Peace) by TM Spiele.  Players are feudal lords that rule their own land and seek to help King Charlemagne build pieces of his castle.  The entire game is made from wood, in a light, clear stain, including the over-sized game board.  Each turn is four seasons, and play continues until all six pieces of the ornate castle are placed.  Players use their resource tiles to bid for that year's agenda, and some resources have more or less value in the bid depending on what type of agenda is available. Then players use their remaining resources to build their lands, sack others' lands, bribe others' knights away from defense, or help to build Charlemagne's castle.  There are slight rules differences between this game and Krieg und Frieden, but mostly a reduction of agenda cards to shorten the game (for the better usually).&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Krieg und Frieden&#10;&#10;&#10;";1998;6.26774;3.0
530;Entenrallye;"Entenrallye is an early game from Walter M&#195;&#188;ller.  More of a nostalgia trip for 2CV owners than a challenging contest, players compete to get their car through a year of car rallies and MOTs (government vehicle tests).&#10;&#10;From the top of the board, your drive your 2CV down a winding track based on die rolls. You can split your roll between movement and storing up repair points, and you try to collect improvements to your car along the way. These are large tiles that sit over your base card, showing your 2CV getting various extras to snazz it up and win points at the seasonal car shows.&#10;&#10;The game has a calendar and markers move along to indicate when the next show is happening. Players have to be in certain areas on the track to win points. Lag too far back and you miss the show. Get too many extras and you cannot pass your MOT. You have to detour off the route to pass these mandatory tests, possibly disrupting your schedule.&#10;&#10;";1988;5.94651;1.75
531;Merchants of Amsterdam;"Is Merchants of Amsterdam, players are attempting to be in first or second place majorities in a variety of categories throughout the game.  These include commodity markets, trading colonies, and warehouses in Amsterdam.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, that player draws three cards and decides how to resolve them for the turn.  A player can either remove the card from the game, keep it for him or herself, or put it up for auction.  The cards allow players to advance or place one of their markers in the various categories.&#10;&#10;There are also time-marker cards which, when drawn, move the game through various &quot;historical&quot; phases until the last which ends the game.  The historical phases follow a period of time in the history of Amsterdam which can range from no effect, to scoring rounds for particular categories, to bonuses, and towards the end of the game to some penalties as wars begin to disrupt business markets.&#10;&#10;The unique twist in the game is that the game comes with a spring-driven auction clock to perform the Dutch auctions throughout the game.  You start the clock and it ticks down as all of the players hold their hands ready close by.  The idea is that as time passes the cost of the card lowers and it is simply an issue of who will pay for it first by slapping down on the clock and thus stopping it at a certain price.&#10;&#10;";2000;6.7075;2.6339
533;Labyrinth: The Card Game;"Part of the Ravensburger Labyrinth Games series. Lay square labyrinth cards showing fantasy symbols like a griffin, dragon, scroll, key, gems, etc.  When a symbol on the card you just laid is directly connected to one or more identical symbols on other cards, you can take those cards (but not the one you just laid), as long as the labyrinth does not become disjointed.  You only hold 2 cards and draw after laying. The game ends when the draw pile is finished, most cards collected wins.  A children's game that is fun enough as a filler for adults.&#10;&#10;";2000;5.58519;1.2143

535;Power Barons;"from the general Comment:&#10;This is essentially a card game. Cards come in four basic suits plus a special gray &quot;political power&quot; suit. The cards have values from 5 - 50, with the most cards in the middle of the range. In your turn, you challenge an opponent to a duel in one of the suits. You play a card in any suit (not necessarily the one you are challenging in) , then your opponent plays a card in the same suit. Players can alternately withdraw, or keep going. You then play a different suit - in the same manner, adding up your total score. The suit you challenged in counts double. If the defender withdraws, the challenger places a base (i.e. scores a point) on the defender. If the challenger withdraws, he just finishes his turn without scoring. However, the loser forfeits all cards played (redrawing, but perhaps taking poorer cards), and the winner holds his played cards, and takes the loser's cards into a pool which can score points.&#10;&#10;If no one withdraws after all four suits have been played, players may add gray cards in an attempt to take the lead. Ultimately, a player will pass or run out of gray cards, at which point the high score will win the hand.&#10;&#10;";1986;5.52591;2.0

538;Manager;"Manager is a deceptively simple game of economics for up to six players. Each player is the manager of one of the six companies, which are supposed to be manufacturers competing in the same market with identical products. (It is strongly hinted that the products are computers.) The player is responsible for setting the sale price of his product, buying machines to automate production, and buying or selling stock in any of the six companies.&#10;&#10;The object of each round--usually--is to charge as much as you can for your product without charging too much more than everyone else. Every turn starts with the players secretly setting the price for their product. The person who has charged the least gets to sell. The one who has charged next-to-least also gets to sell--as long as his price wasn't more than 1,000 DM above the person below him. In fact, as long as there isn't a 1,000 DM gap between one player's price and the next, every player gets to sell. But any player who has charged over 1,000 DM more than his next-lowest competitor--and all players who charged more than him--gets locked out of the market.&#10;&#10;The prices on the stock market vary depending on who got to sell and who didn't. The companies that got shut out of the market lose ground. The companies that sold their product gain, with the one who got the highest price gaining the most.&#10;&#10;There is room for all kinds of maneuvering in the game. After the first few rounds, you make more money on the stock market than you do running your company, so you can actually drive your company into the ground--advancing someone else's company--and come out ahead.&#10;&#10;";1979;6.39816;2.5333
539;Dampfross;"This game was originally designed by a teacher to be used as a learning tool.  There are several different editions of this game (originally released in the UK as Railway Rivals), but most feature several different hexagonal maps of real locations, such as Tennessee and Germany.  Starting from one of the cities pictured on the map, players build track during the first part of the game.  Players receive a small bonus for reaching a city before anyone else, but otherwise funds are quite limited.  After nearly every city has been connected to someone's rail line, several races are held on the resultant track.  The starting city and destination city are determined randomly, and players can use each other's track (for a nominal fee, of course).  After all races have been held, the player with largest bank account is the winner.&#10;&#10;This series of games is very similar to Mayfair Game's crayon rail games series, though they use erasable marker pens instead of crayons.&#10;&#10;";1979;6.20612;2.1772

541;Das Motorsportspiel;"This racing game is packaged in a long, plastic tube.  Included in the game are huge maps on large poster-sized sheets, a collection of miniature touring cars (complete with spoilers, hood ornaments, roll-bars and lots of other details), and dice.&#10;&#10;The cars are lined up and the race begins.  Going in order from first to last, players have a choice of rolling one, two, or three dice.  The first die is a special die with only 1's, 2's and 3's on it, but the other two are normal d6.  The dice may be flipped to the opposite face. Before moving the car, the player must commit to the order that the dice will be used. The dice are then used to move your car.  However, if you use a die for movement in a corner that's not rated for that speed, you'll get a driving error.  Depending on the severity, you might have to journey through pit row on the next lap.  Dice showing 2,3,5 allow the car to move diagonally, or else the car must maintain its lane. There is a drafting mechanism that entails following into specially marked spaces. All of this would make the game fairly computational and boring, until you time the players' turns and make the rule, &quot;A die laid is a die played...&quot;&#10;&#10;The original game came with the DTM Hockenheimring track and there are two subsequent maps to find or purchase, which includes the latest track released at Essen 2000.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    N&uuml;rburgring&#10;    Oschersleben&#10;&#10;&#10;";1995;7.47473;2.0

Who can get the most delicious candies in this exciting voting game?&#10;&#10;Based on Karl-Heinz Schmiel's Das Regeln Wir Schon, players attempt to pass laws which benefit themselves.  The laws are either immediate or semi-permanent, and they can have all kinds of different effects: all players with beards get five points, vote cards must be played with the left hand, or some sort of re-evaluation or redistribution of the chips that each player has.  The chips are the main way that players score, but their worth fluctuates constantly.  On a turn, a player draws a card and then proposes a vote, and this continues until the End card is drawn.&#10;&#10;A winner of the 1999 Concours International de Cr&#195;&#169;ateurs de Jeux de Soci&#195;&#169;t&#195;&#169;.&#10;&#10;";2000;5.53468;1.2844
545;Kaleidos;"From Game Report Review:&#10;&#10;The game comes with four identical sets of ten paintings, each depicting a scene packed (to greater and lesser extents) with various objects. Each of up to four players or teams uses their own set, so there&rsquo;s no craning around to see the picture at the far end of the table. In fact, spiffy cardboard easels prop up the scenes nicely so they&rsquo;re easier to view.  Everyone loads identical scenes onto their easels and a deck of cards  provides a letter for the round. Everyone gets sixty seconds to write down as many things beginning with that letter as they can find in the scene. Although each word can be used only once - a football and baseball wouldn&rsquo;t count as two BALLS - an object can be used multiple times for different words (e.g., BASEBALL, BALL).  Once time has expired, players read through the lists. Any object on multiple lists scores one point for those who wrote it. Any item unique to a single list scores three points. When all lists have been scored everyone advances to the next scene and a new letter is chosen. The high score after all 12 scenes wins.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Kaleidos Junior&#10;&#10;&#10;";1994;6.70174;1.2308

The players attempt to flick their fleas (chips) onto the board tiddlywinks-style, with the goal of having the most chips in each area, but without having them fall in the center hole. Players with good dexterity can attempt to use their chips to knock other player's chips out of an area and, preferably, into the hole. There are special chips that freeze out (or neutralize) an area, as well as other special chips that serve to neutralize the neutralizing chips.&#10;&#10;";1997;6.51667;1.0
548;Buck Rogers: Battle for the 25th Century Game;"Fight for control of the twenty-fifth century Inner Solar System as imagined in the 1950s in this strategy game which is a close relative of Axis &amp; Allies. The map board's Solar System Display keeps track of the 4 inner planets (Mercury through Mars) and the 9 larger asteroids along their orbits. The rest of the board is taken up by the various territorial displays; the larger planets are subdivided, plus there is Deimos around Mars, the Moon, L-4 and L-5 around Earth and Mercury's two artificial satellites --for a total of 42 territories.&#10;&#10;Leader Characters each have special powers. Troopers represent the grunts --infantry workhorses and cannon fodder. &quot;Gennies&quot; are Genetically Engineered fighters; they are stronger than Troopers but cannot leave the planet for which they were designed. Transport ships carry troops and factories between planets. War ships come as Fighters and Battlers (i.e., Bombers). Killer Satellites play the role of air defense. Factories make all these pieces - although you do have a Black Market option.&#10;&#10;As the planets move through their orbits you must plan your own moves well in advance to exploit planetary conjunctions. The movement rules consider not only the ship movements in the planet's orbits, but also the respective revolutions of the planets around the sun, and allow players to plan some nice surprises when two planets are near one another, which usually happens only once or twice in the game.&#10;&#10;Upgraded by:&#10;&#10;    Buck Rogers 2.0&#10;&#10;&#10;";1988;6.48565;2.6757
549;Aerodrome;"Excerpted from a review by Ken Tidwell&#10;&#10;Aerodrome is a miniatures game of aerial combat during World War I. Players take on the role of biplane pilots and tail gunners dog fighting their way through the gray skies of Europe during the war to end all wars. The game is visually appealing and, like many miniatures games, it was easy to project myself into the scenario. The game is played using 1/72 miniature aircraft mounted on radio antennae with a clear acrylic hex base to hold the whole thing upright. The game board is an aerial view of a WWI battlefield marked off in large hexes.&#10;&#10;Pilots and gunners plot out three moves at a time. Each move the pilot chooses from one of eight maneuvers - straight ahead, straight ahead fast, left slip, right slip, right, left, hard right, stall, and Immelman. The slips allow the player to retain their current orientation but slide one hex to the right or left. Ahead fast allows the plane to move two hexes. Ahead, left, right, and hard right allow the plane to change orientation and move one hex in that new direction. An Immelman allows the plane to move forward one hex but completely reverse orientation. A stall allows the plane to stay in its current hex with the current orientation but runs the risk of throwing the plane into a spin. Planes can fly on one of five altitudes. Descent is always possible but planes can generally only ascend when moving forward and trying no wild acrobatics. After movement, pilots may fire on any plane unlucky enough to find itself in their path.&#10;&#10;";1994;7.54521;2.2308
550;Barbarossa;"Barbarossa, in Italian &quot;red beard&quot; was, according to its inventor, inspired by Patricia McKillip's Riddle-Master fantasy trilogy (Die Schule der R&auml;tselmeister in the German translation), in which wizards are devoted to the creation of riddles and riddle solving tournaments. In an interview designer Klaus Teuber stated &quot;As you know there are moments when you close a book really sad that it's over. After finishing the last page, you often feel like you've lost a friend -- to be somewhat melodramatic. So I was looking for a way to keep the book alive a little longer. Creating a game seemed the perfect solution. In this game, I was looking for a way to make riddles, to experiment with shapes and to let the players express their own creativity with clay.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game starts with players using modeling clay to make objects that can be guessed by the other players. Players then take turns to move around the board either by rolling a die or spending gems to choose their move. The spaces landed on determine actions. Either the other players receive victory points, or you can ask a letter of an object (What's the fifth letter of that thing?), or you can ask general questions or make a single guess until you get a NO answer. Players also have three curse stones that they can throw down twice in the game and make a guess.&#10;&#10;You make a guess by writing the word down and passing it to the owner, who answers YES or NO. If you guess right, you stick an arrow in the object and score points (5pts if you're first, 3pts for second correct guess). In addition, and this matters, the object owner can either gain points or lose points, depending on the total arrows sticking at the time. So if you make your object too easy, or too hard, you lose points, but if you get it just right, you gain. Plus, at the game end, objects lacking arrows also lose their owners points.&#10;&#10;Your objects must each represent a single specific word, which you note down in secret. Trying to think of two or three things that people will guess, but not too easily, is really tricky and makes Barbarossa a fun game. Hopefully the new edition has a better rules set, as players might get puzzled by the variety of actions.&#10;&#10;A later-developed game directly inspired by Barbarossa is  Dominic Crapuchettes' Cluzzle.&#10;&#10;Re-published by Kosmos / Rio Grande 2001.&#10;&#10;Republished by Mayfair Games in 2005, in an edition for a maximum of 4 players in a smaller-sized box.&#10;&#10;";1988;6.32134;1.5524
551;Battle Cry;"A low complexity game of a variety of civil war battles.  Modular terrain through the use of hexagonal tiles allows for the setup of several famous civil war battle fields and a plethora of plastic civil war miniatures are used to represent the various forces during the conflict (infantry, cavalry, artillery and leaders).  Players manage a hand of cards that provide different orders to your troops in the right flank, left flank and center position of the battlefield.&#10;&#10;This game is the first to use what would evolve into Richard Borg's Command and Colors system.&#10;&#10;The game rules include the following scenarios:&#10;First Bull Run--21st July, 1861&#10;Pea Ridge--7th March, 1862&#10;Kernstown--23rd March, 1862&#10;Shiloh--6th April, 1862&#10;Gaines Mill--27th June, 1862&#10;Brawner's Farm--28th August, 1862&#10;Antietam--17th September, 1862&#10;Fredericksburg--13th December, 1862&#10;Murfreesboro--31st December, 1862&#10;Chancellorsville--3rd May, 1863&#10;Gettysburg--2nd July, 1863&#10;Gettysburg--3rd July, 1863&#10;Chickamauga--20th September, 1863&#10;New Market--15th May, 1864&#10;New Hope Church--25th May, 1864&#10;&#10;";1999;7.16787;2.0967
552;Bus;"Prior to Essen 1999, a group of students created Splotter Spellen to sell some of their own game designs.  This game is regarded as one of the highlights of that group.  The object of the game is to deliver as many people to their destinations as you can.  To accomplish this, players place route markers on the board to connect passengers to their destinations.  However, the destination types (work, bar, home) vary from turn to turn, so you can follow certain passengers as they make their way through the daily grind.&#10;&#10;Players may buy more buses (they start off with one), build onto their bus route, bring new passengers to the city (via the trains), expand the city by adding more buildings, and run their buses. There is another option, the clock. The action board has one other clever feature. On some actions, route expansion and building, the first player to choose that action actually gets to execute the action last! Which leads to some interesting games of chicken and some painful decisions.&#10;&#10;Buying more buses allows a player to carry one more passenger every time they run their buses - hence scoring, in the best case, one more point. Depending on how the city gets built, however, finding lots of passengers on the street can be tricky.&#10;&#10;Bus routes extend from either end of a Settlers-style initial placement. Extensions are appended to either end. Routes may only run parallel if there are no empty streets at one of the ends or the line ends on the crossing as another player's end. All new passengers will arrive at one of two train stations so that is one concern when route building. One must also be careful to run by a nice mix of building types. And, when building, one must always have an eye towards spoiling other players' routes by placing a mix of building types at each of their intersection so that all of their passengers just walk! Finally, when carrying passengers, one wants to be careful to set up to carry the same passenger next turn.&#10;&#10;";1999;7.67407;3.0444
553;Chez Geek;"In this light, humorous, and fast-paced card game that parodies geek culture and co-habitation, players are roommates just trying to get through life with as little work as possible.&#10;&#10;At setup each player is dealt a Job card which lists their free time, income, a special ability that they possess and their Slack goal. Players are also dealt five Life cards. The space directly in front of a player is their Room, where cards will be played during the course of the game. Slack can be represented using any available chit or counter, but every player begins with a Slack total of zero.&#10;&#10;Players take turns as follows:&#10;-Draw Life cards until they have six in hand. (NOTE: Some Jobs vary this to five or seven cards.)&#10;&#10;-Make &quot;variable&quot; rolls. Some Job cards have variable free time or income; their values for this turn are decided in this phase (rolling a 1-3 gives them   the first amount; rolling a 4-6 gives them the second). If there are any &quot;uninvited&quot; people in a player's room, he or she may also roll to &quot;get rid of&quot; them (by rolling a 4, 5 or 6) and either send each such person to another room or discard them (if they cannot be played to any other room).&#10;&#10;-If any of the player's in-hand Life cards are green Person cards, they may roll to &quot;call&quot; the person to their room. A successful roll (3-6) gets them invited in; otherwise, they are discarded. Some people are &quot;uninvited&quot; (causing bad things to happen), and may be placed without a roll in any player's room. (See above for &quot;getting rid of&quot; these people.) Pet cards, such as Cats (which don't require a roll to enter a room) and Dogs (which may or may not need to be &quot;called&quot;) can also be played in this round.&#10;&#10;-For each unit of free time the player's Job card gives them, they may perform one action (play a red Activity card) or go shopping (play any number of blue Thing cards). Some of these cards may have a cost; the total cost for all cards played in a round cannot exceed the income given to them by their Job card. (NOTE: Free Time and Income may be modified by certain Whenever cards played on the player by themselves or other players.)&#10;&#10;-At the end of a turn, if a player has more than five cards in hand, the player must discard cards until they have five or fewer. If desired, players can discard all the way down to one card. (NOTE: It is also legal for a player to play ALL the cards in their hand and have NO cards at the end of a turn.)&#10;&#10;-Additionally, some Life cards are orange &quot;Whenever&quot; cards which can be played at any time.&#10;&#10;-Activity cards and Thing cards typically list a Slack value which is added to the player's Slack total, though some have random Slack totals and some have Slack totals which vary during the game. TV Activity cards and some Whenever cards can be used to cancel cards as they are being played, and some cause previously-played cards to be discarded. Some cards add or subtract Slack from every player's total, while others cause a player to change their Job card (and hence Slack goal). Many cards alter the effects of other cards.&#10;&#10;The first player whose Slack total equals or exceeds their Slack goal is the winner.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.70494;1.4205
554;La CittÃ ;"Set in the Italian countryside, La Citt&agrave; features various city-states vying for population. Each player starts with two cities and is charged with expanding the different aspects of those cities to attract larger populations.&#10;&#10;Players build farms to feed their people, quarries to finance their expansions, marketplaces to allow growth in their cities, and bathhouses to keep their people clean and healthy. Additionally, structures can be built that give the city influence in one of three categories; superiority in one of these categories causes population to shift from other nearby cities when the &quot;Voice of the People&quot; is decided at the end of each turn.&#10;&#10;At the end of six turns, the player with the most points &mdash; which are distributed for well-rounded cities, well-fed populations, and the overall size of population &mdash; wins.&#10;&#10;Note: The correct pronunciation is like &quot;Cheetah&quot;, but with the accent on the last syllable: &quot;La Chee-TAH&quot;.&#10;&#10;";2000;7.01023;3.2688

The game includes a variety of professions, such astronomers, organists, and architects; each profession is attracted to a particular combination of building, landscape feature, and social freedom, and players acquire these items via auctions. The more that a player can match these preferences, the more work points they earn &mdash; but the minimum requirement of work points increases each round, and you must meet that threshold in order to convert the work points.&#10;&#10;";2000;7.49936;3.2416
556;7 Safari;"&quot;Lions and Rhinos and Birds, Oh my!&quot;&#10;&#10;In 7 Safari, players participate on a wild animal adventure. The mission of each player is to scout the jungle and collect as many different animals as possible, for as many points. You turn over a face-down card on a grid of cards, and replace it with a card from your hand. The catch is that each row and each column may never have more than one of each animal. Animals have different point values on their cards, and only one card will count positive points - more than one of a type will count negative points at the end. Hyenas, however are always negative.&#10;&#10;Originally Published in German as Alles f&uuml;r die Katz:&#10;The title means &quot;Everything for the Cat&quot; and may have an idiomatic meaning of &quot;all for nothing.&quot;&#10;&#10;In Alles f&uuml;r die Katz The animals in the zoo are loose and players must attempt to collect one of each type out of a face down grid which represents the zoo, but must avoid collecting any black cats which do not belong in the zoo.

559;Metro;"Similar to Streetcar, Tsuro, Tantrix and Spaghetti Junction, this game has players putting square tiles onto the board to form rail lines. The major difference in this game, however, is that players are not striving to make short, direct routes like those sought in Streetcar. Instead, the object of the game is to make the rail lines as long as possible.  Players start with a number of trains ringing the board.  Whenever a tile placement connects a train to a station (either on the edge or the center of the board), that train is removed and the player scores one point for each tile that the route crosses, which can cause one tile to score multiple times if the track loops around.  However, players score double for city connections, which are the stations in the center of the board.&#10;&#10;For those interested in graph theory, a key part of the Metro game design is that the routes will always connect a starting subway train station with an empty destination station, rather than routing to another starting subway train station. The tiles implement a design principle which allows any tile to be placed on any open grid space, subject to rules for alignment with existing tile edges. If correctly placed per the rules, the routing will allow for all trains to score, albeit not necessarily for the high run value the owner would like to attain.&#10;&#10;The game was originally issued as Iron Horse (not to be confused with Iron Horse).&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Cable Car&#10;&#10;&#10;";1997;6.36567;1.6839

The boats that players use have spaces for two pirates, and each time one of the occupants decides to row the boat, the rock-paper-scissors aspect of the game kicks in.  Players have the option of rowing, tossing the other player out of the boat, or attempting to beat the other pirate with a club.

562;Silberzwerg;"Players manage a set of dwarves mining for gems to fulfill randomly distributed contracts.  Each turn, players simultaneously decide where to send their dwarves.  Four of the dwarves are simply miners and will mine a particular color of gem, depending on placement.  Gem prices are set each round, cheaper the more dwarves that are mining it.  Players also have two boss dwarves, which can either be shadow dwarves (used to carry out evil actions on other players), or silver dwarves (usually beneficial actions for the player).  Assembling the correct assortment of gems and assigning a silver dwarf to fulfill a contract, he can score either his own contract or one of two open contracts.

563;Doolittle & Waite;"The game of the great American lawsuit. &#10;In this fast-paced card game, each player becomes a lawyer, who weighs the facts of the case, examines the law, watches out for hostile juries, and even occasionally deals with stubborn clients. In Doolittle &amp; Waite, as in the real world of legal disputes, players deal head-on, negotiating, bluffing, and even threatening in an attempt to win the case before trial through that noblest of all legal institutions ---the out of court settlement.&#10;&#10;There are enough cards for up to 15 players, but 8 is a more practical limit.&#10;&#10;";1986;6.24552;1.8571
564;Die SeidenstraÃe;"from the rules translation:&#10;&#10;In 1225 the Venezian Marco Polo arrived home from his great journey of discovery to the mysterious land of China. His accounts from the land was so overwhelmingly fantastic and adventurous, that one could hardly believe him. Yet, the precious cargo he brought with him, convinced even the most discriminating and suspicious among the Venezians.&#10;&#10;Everyone wanted to have some of the valuable goods from China. Through the Silk Road &mdash; the legendary trading route which connected China with Europe &mdash;  traders brought exquisite treasures home, most importantly, precious silk,  which no one outside of China knew how to make.&#10;&#10;But the road which led to Venezia through the Gobi desert and passing the great commercial centers of Xi'an, Samarkand, Buchara, Bagdad and Byzanz, was dangerous. This made the traders dependent on each other during the journey. Nevertheless this did not stop them from, using the right tactics and a trace of cunning, trying to gain advantages over each other. Especially in the Bazaars and at the large Trading Posts which lined the route. The first to arrive would make the most profitable deals and receive the most ounces of Silver when they arrived at the end of their trip.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.51474;1.7778

Here they haggle and toddle around the goods that were captured, in order to load them on their ships and to sell them for a profit.&#10;&#10;The goal for each player is to have the largest amount of booty loaded on his ships, but each ship can only hold a limited amount.

566;Wongar;"The board for this game features several square-ish areas, which each have their own draw pile.  Players each sequentially pick the top card which has the action they'd like to take.  These actions revolve around placing of control markers on the board.  There are three types of control markers that are available, and each type of marker will score each time the area is scored.  The areas are scored when either the Ancestor or the Elder tokens appear in the area, and moving either of the tokens gives the moving player the first-player status or extra scoring cards.  The scoring cards are the last element, as once an area is scored the players involved in the area use these cards to manipulate control makers in the general vicinity.  Scattered throughout the decks are scorpion cards, which ages the game to completion and increases the value of the scorings through the game.&#10;&#10;";2000;6.2873;2.9762
567;Quartier Latin;"from web page:&#10;&#10;You are the owner of a fancy bistro in the fashionable Quartier Latin in Paris, the most important investments are made: you have bought tables, chairs and tableware and have engaged fairly qualified personnel. Shortly before the opening of your pub the disaster happens. The competitors send hooligans to your premises that are about to destroy your work. You are determined to fight. Let 's hope that you have better cards than your opponents!&#10;&#10;Two teams of two or three players compete with the aim to open as many pubs as they can. But they not only try to set up their own enterprise but also to cancel the efforts of the other team by any means. For this purpose the teams can hire hooligans and bombers to threat the opponents. They can also cause other inconveniences like influenza for the personnel of the other team, pipe bursts or denial of credit. The other team can defend themselves with their own hooligans, managers or the two doormen Gaston and Gustave. Both, developing / opening of pubs and getting rid of the competitors, gain points. You have, for example, destroyed the other teams disco. Not only do the others not score points with their disco if you call a disco your own, their customers come to your premises (where else could they dance?)  and you collect MONEY (points)!! But even if you only have a simple beer garden, the bomb attack was useful for your business because the disco-dancers will visit the other pubs of the quarter if they don 't find their favorite disco, and yours is one of them.&#10;&#10;By the end of the game the most successful gastronome is obviously the one with the most points.&#10;&#10;";1997;5.5;0.0
568;Rage;"Based on the widely-known card game Oh Hell!, players use the deck of zero through fifteen in six suits to bid for a particular number of tricks and then subsequently take exactly that many.  Each game consists of ten hands, with the hand size shrinking by one each time, until the final one-card hand.  Along the way, trump is randomly determined and can be changed during the hand through the use of special cards.  There are also special cards that make the trump not count for a trick, others that can be declared any suit and value when played, and others that will give bonuses or penalties for taking the trick on which they're played.  A newer version of this game was released by Amigo in 2000.&#10;&#10;";1983;6.1954;1.471

573;Grand Prix;"Extrapolated from Harrington description:&#10;&#10;Each player controls a team of 3 cars. On your turn you assign a movement of 6 to one car, 5 to another and 4 to the third car (on your next turn you may assign the movement allowances differently if you wish).&#10;&#10;To add a bit of racing flavor there is the option of slipstreaming (drafting). This is achieved by landing on a space marked with a chevron. If your car is directly behind another car then you may move an additional 3 spaces. If this takes you on to a space offering another slipstreaming opportunity (very rare!) then you may slipstream for a second time (but not a third).&#10;&#10;Grand Prix was also published in the compilations of Bertelsmann Buchclub in 1976 (see Jockey & Grand Prix),&#10;and in 1980 by Carlit as part of Spiele-Box .&#10;&#10;";1975;6.39091;1.3636
574;Devil Take the Hindmost;"In this clever racing game, cars move around a 30-space track on which the spaces are numbered from 1 to 10, then 1 to 10 again, then 1 to 10 for a third time.  The cards have different powers depending on which number your car is sitting on.  For instance, a card might move you 8 spaces if you're sitting on an 8, but only 3 spaces otherwise.  Cards go in and out of your hand at a rapid rate as you play and discard your way through a series of races, and card management skills will come in handy if you've got them.  Each race goes by quite quickly, but the game consists of a whole series of races -- 11 if you play with the full complement of 3 cars each for 4 players or 2 cars each for 6 -- the gimmick being that, at the end of each race, the car that came in last is removed from the game, and the next race has one fewer starters -- and so on until the game is down to the last two cars and the last race for the ultimate victory.&#10;&#10;Originally released as Devil takes the Hindmost which has the same mechanics but is a cycling-racing game.&#10;&#10;";1991;6.42339;1.5135

577;Parts Unknown;"Players are retail store owners who supply body parts to the local mad scientists. Viktor, a mad scientist, goes around window shopping. Whenever he stops to look at a particular type of parts, a demand for that type of part is created; all the parts at the cheapest price get sold. If there is still a demand, all the parts at the next cheapest price get sold. This continues until demand is met. If parts sold exceed demand, a surplus is created, which may put an extra townsfolk back into the population. If the demand is not met, a shortage is created which will be filled by removing a townsfolk.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players get a part from their gravediggers, and can pay for more parts. Players can buy store shelves, and stock those shelves with parts, setting them to a specific, fixed price. If parts don't sell. the may be shuffled off to the &quot;parts unknown&quot; pile, which will automatically sell at certain times at a highly discounted rate. There could be, at times, a monster on the loose which scares off shoppers, getting them to buy parts only at the cheapest price, ignoring other available parts. Also, villagers might riot, which causes parts from the gravediggers to be more expensive.

Players play 3 cards from their hand and must do one of 3 things to &quot;keep up with the Joneses&quot;: &#10;1. play 2 cards which match in suit, of which one of those cards are higher in rank (3rd card does not have to match)&#10;&#10;2. play 3 cards which do not match suits AT ALL, which the total value is higher than the Show-Off's 3 cards)&#10;&#10;3. play 3 cards which all match in suit, regardless of value&#10;&#10;Once we've determined if any players have &quot;kept up&quot;, we throw out all the cards played and the Show-Off lays down another 3 cards (from his now 6 card hand).

581;Tile Chess;"In Tile Chess, the board isn't used and the pieces are represented by tiles. The pieces move in the traditional fashion, including capturing, and the game &mdash; and the pieces for that matter &mdash; is held together by the restriction that each piece must always be connected to another piece, with that piece being connected to another, etc. Thanks to this requirement, the board and the grid that the pieces move on is formed by the pieces themselves (or lack thereof). You cannot make moves that would orphan pieces, which adds an interesting wrinkle to the game &mdash; and to make matters worse (in a good way), you might have to defend yourself against more than just one opponent...&#10;&#10;";1999;5.98909;2.6818
582;Kampf um Rom;"Kampf um Rom (Struggle for Rome) is actually two games in one.  Two designers have utilized the same components and come up with two different games.&#10;&#10;Germanica by Hartmut Witt deals with the crumbling of the Roman Empire with the invasion of the German barbarians.  Kind of a cross between Britannia and Civilization, players play a series of tribes that flow through the region.  The aim of the game is to gain the most cultural advances by creating as much stability in a region as possible.&#10;&#10;Huns, Romans, and Germans by Gerhard H. Kuhlmann follows a similar theme although the game is broken down into basic and advanced rules and scenarios.&#10;&#10;The game comes with wood tokens as the playing pieces.  Detailed stickers are applied to the tokens to represent various types of units.  A deck of cards also accompanies the game which drives the invasions and advancements.  Lastly the game board itself is a beautifully painted map of Europe detailed in Latin.&#10;&#10;";1995;5.62;3.2
586;Up Front;"Only once in a great while does a game dare to be truly different and abandon old concepts while striking out to chart virgin territory in game design. Rarer still are the instances in which these games succeed in presenting a simulation of unparalleled realism in an easily comprehended and playable format. In UP FRONT, we have just such a game. Gone are the hexes and charts of conventional wargames; replaced by innovative and attractive game components which have distilled a wealth of technical data into one of the most playable, yet detail laden formats ever devised.&#10;&#10;UP FRONT is a game of man-to-man infantry combat set in WWII Europe. In many ways, the game is more realistic than SQUAD LEADER principles in that its inherent mechanics simulate the fear and confusion of the battlefield and the inability of leadership to assert itself far better than any tactical combat game yet published. There is no playing board; it has been replaced by Terrain cards which become the &ldquo;hexagons&rdquo; of the game as players maneuver their forces via Action cards over constantly changing terrain. The scale of the game is measured in terms of relative ranges between opposing forces, with most combat occurring within a scale distance of 500 meters during the course of player turns measured in varying seconds of actual time.&#10;&#10;UP FRONT is a game player&rsquo;s game, rich in detail yet easily playable within the space of a lunch hour. However, it also contains engrossing Multi-Player and Campaign Game versions which could last a week or more. Like SQUAD LEADER, UP FRONT is an open-ended game capable of depicting endless Design-Your-Own variations of small unit actions between American, German and Russian combatants. Tanks, Assault Guns, Smoke, Anti-Tank Rifles, Demolition Charges, Pillboxes, Partisans, SS, Entrenchments, Anti-Tank Mines, Infantry Guns, Flamethrowers, Armoured Cars, Halftracks, Panzerfausts, Bazookas, Panzerschrecks, Wire, Ambushes, Radios, Artillery, Minefields, Mortars, Snipers, Starshells, Heroes, Prisoners and Fords are all accounted for. In fact, UP FRONT encompasses almost everything that the SQUAD LEADER game system has taken four gamettes to do, and does so in a far more playable format. The game can be summed up in four words: Innovation, playability, detail and realism. That&rsquo;s an unbeatable combination.&#10;&#10;&#10;UP FRONT is rated 4 on the Avalon Hill Complexity scale of 1 (easy) to 10 (difficult).&#10;&#10;Recommended for two or more discriminating players of skill, ages 12 &amp; up.&#10;&#10;Each game includes: &#10;&#10;     162 full-colour, quality 2&frac14;&quot; &times; 3 &frac12;&quot; playing cards&#10;     120 full-colour 2&quot; &times; 2.6&quot; infantry cards&#10;     40 full-colour 2.3&quot; &times; 3.1&quot; AFV cards (maybe 39 cards?

592;Spades;"This trick-taking game is a standard deck playing card game and takes on many different group-specific rules.  Generally speaking, each player is given thirteen cards and a partner who sits across the table.  Each player bids the number of tricks they'll take, and then the partners collectively attempt to take at least as many as they bid.  The tricks are fairly standard with following suit if you can, and spades as the trump suit.  If you make your bid you earn ten times the number of tricks you bid, otherwise you lose that many points.  Plus there is usually a nil bid, which means you personally won't take any tricks but your partner still plays as normal.&#10;&#10;Call Break is a popular variation of Spades among card game players in South Asian countries. To win, players must score the maximum points in 5 rounds. Points equal the number of tricks bid in each hand.

594;Sleuth;"In Sleuth, a classic deduction game from master designer Sid Sackson originally released as part of the 3M Gamette Series, players are searching for a hidden gem, one of 36 gem cards hidden before the start of the game. The remainder of this gem deck &ndash; with each card showing 1-3 diamonds, pearls or opals in one of four colors &ndash; is distributed evenly among the players, with any remaining cards laid face up. Thus, you and everyone else starts with some information about what's not missing.&#10;&#10;A second deck contains 54 search cards, each showing one or two elements, such as diamonds, pairs, blue opals, red pearls, or an element of your choice. Each player receives four face-up search cards; on a turn, you choose one of those cards and ask an opponent how many gem cards they have of the type shown. If you ask for, say, pairs, the player must tell you how many pairs they hold but not which specific pairs; if you ask for something more specific, say, red diamonds, the player reveals to everyone how many such cards she holds while you get to look at them in secret.&#10;&#10;Players track information on a score pad. You can guess the hidden gem at any time, or on your turn you can ask any one question regardless of which search cards you have, then immediately make a guess by marking your sheet and checking the hidden gem card. If you're wrong, you keep playing but can only answer questions; if you're correct, you win.&#10;&#10;The simplicity of the rules and the cards belies the complexity of the game. In some cases you see cards, while in others you hear only the number of cards that an opponent holds, making it tough to deduce. Any notation system you devise must be both flexible and reliable, recording negative information as well as positive in order to tick off the possibilities one by one...&#10;&#10;Reimplements:&#10;&#10;    The Case of the Elusive Assassin, with the core mechanisms of that game being used in Sleuth, minus the game board, movement and player proximity.&#10;&#10;&#10;";1971;6.90429;2.4648

606;Pico 2;"from game review:&#10;&#10;The  game is composed of 11 cards. These are numbered 4 through 13 plus 16 and each also bears a number of &quot;pips&quot;. (From one on the 4 card to four on the 16 card.) A round is played as follows: each player is dealt 5 cards with the eleventh card discarded face-up. (Note that this means that you know exactly what cards your opponent holds.) Each turn both you and your opponent secretly select one of their respective cards and reveal them simultaneously. The higher card wins and that player sets that card aside scoring the number of pips on it. The loser retains his/her played card. However, if the higher card is more than twice the lower card then it's the lower card that is placed aside and scored. So the 13 will beat the 10 but lose to the 6. Play continues until one player is left with but a single card. Points are then scored and, here's the clever bit, players swap hands and do it again. This ensures that each game is exactly fair as both players will have equal opportunity to play a strong/weak hand. After these two rounds the points are totaled and a winner declared. There are, at most, fourteen card plays in a game and so the game is usually over in two or three minutes.&#10;&#10;";1997;5.89653;1.1515
607;Honor of the Samurai;"from the review:&#10;&#10;This card game recreates the atmosphere of the Sengoku era in Japan's history: the struggle among the feudal lords (Daimyos) to install a strong and legitimate Shogun. To install themselves as Shogun, that is.&#10;&#10;Every player takes the role of one family of Samurai and the Daimyo they serve. They use honorable weddings, weapons, cultural sponsorship and military power to increase the honor of the family (and attack each other) until one of them reaches a previously stipulated amount of honor. Whoever reaches this honor in the first place is the winner, and the new Shogun.&#10;&#10;";1996;5.94019;2.191
608;Siesta;"This abstract boardgame is made completely of wood and is quite beautiful.  The object of the game is to score the most points before one of the types of pieces are all gone.  There are Roofs in each of the players' colors, which are used to score points when they cast a Shadow.  A Sun token is placed next to a Roof and will score the Roof's owner points for each Shadow placed on the other side.  The Shadows score points for the Roof's owner, and can be scored multiple times if surrounded by multiple Roof/Sun combinations.  Each turn, a player places three pieces in any combination, but must score at least one point per turn.  The game ends when one player plays his last Roof or the last Sun or Shadow is played.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.3504;2.52
609;Ferkelei;"Players do essentially two things in Ferkelei: Shift their portfolios of stock in show pigs, and play cards to award prize money to pigs (or cause them to lose money or not to win). Many stock-based games have these features, but this game has a significant bandwagon effect. As one color of pig became active, many players would accumulate its stock, and the stockholders would naturally do things that helped each other, without forming explicit alliances. Then the color would play out, or other players would quash it or play the negative pig, and the game would move on to another color. The effect is like successive waves of popularity being washed out or dashed.&#10;&#10;More about the mechanics for those who are interested: On each turn, the player may exchange one stock chip for another or buy one. (At the start, nobody has cash to buy, so they only have their initial two chips available for exchange.) Then the player plays as many cards of one color as they like (from zero to five, except zero is not allowed if one has five or the draw pile is empty). Playing the cards can cover up competing pigs and/or bring one's favored pig to the fore, awarding it prizes depending on how far it has reached and how many times it appears on the board.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Merchants, with a number of changes&#10;&#10;&#10;";1995;5.67241;1.6667
610;Knights of the Rainbow;"Knights of the Rainbow is from FX Schmid USA. The box rates the game for 2-6, the rules rate it for 2-4, and the body of the rules refer to a maximum of five players. It is recommended that players stay within the 2-4 range, where 3 players seems ideal, otherwise the benefits of the honor cards (see below) are far too strong.&#10;&#10;Players start with seven strength, two gold, and no cards. On each turn a player can flip one, two, or three cards from the deck, keeping one of them and discarding the rest. All of a player&rsquo;s cards are kept face-up, stacked by type so everyone can see them.&#10;&#10;Players win by knocking out all opponents or having the highest score after three passes through the deck. Most of the cards are distributed among five color-coded types: strength, force, gold, magic, and honor. The player with the most cards of each type gains an advantage, usually at the start of his turn. The simplest of these increase a player&rsquo;s strength or gold, or decrease other players&rsquo; strength. The leader in magic can trade any of his cards for any card from the discard pile, or sacrifice any one of his own cards to destroy an opponent&rsquo;s card.&#10;&#10;Honor works differently. Shuffled into the deck are four &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Favor&rdquo; cards. When one of these is turned up, the player with the most honor gets two gold, two strength, or the top card from the deck. Misfortune cards are the dark side of the same coin, forcing loss of gold, strength, or cards from all players. Many cards bear a rainbow icon, however, and the player showing the most rainbows at the top of their stacks is protected from Misfortune.&#10;&#10;A player can spend gold at the end of his turn to buy another card from the deck, decrease an opponent&rsquo;s strength, or trade cards with an opponent. A player losing his last strength is knocked out of the game. Anyone who survives to the third appearance of the Long Live the King card (which triggers a reshuffle) scores a point for each magic card, strength, and gold they have. The highest total wins.&#10;&#10;";1999;4.95072;1.1667
611;Ironman Football;"Ironman Football is a team management game based on gridiron football in the early 1920's. That was a time when there were no TV million$, no real passing game as they played with a squashed medicine ball, shoulder padding was a sturdy arrant jumper, helmets were strictly optional and you were expected to play on both offense and defense.&#10;&#10;The game features such notable institutions as the Pottsville Maroons, the Dayton Triangles and the Frankford Yellowjackets, and mega stars like Red Grange, George Halas, Jim Thorpe and Paul Robeson.&#10;        &#10;The game works on the old system of pulling a team together, playing a series of games, whacking down some event cards and trying to obtain the best record to win the league.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game you are handed some event cards, a league franchise, a team name and, unless you are very unlucky, a handful of star players. You also get some money.   Your core players, the poor faceless grunts in the trenches, are abstracted into a simple team rating and a total salary bill (excellent idea) but the star players, the backs and ends, are each given their own individual card. As team manager, it is your job to balance the huge benefits of having these talented individuals on your staff with the interestingly high salaries they demand for performance.&#10;&#10;The three key areas of offense, defense and special teams can all be enhanced by the star cards.&#10;&#10;In addition to the player-controlled teams, who will usually play each other twice, the game also supplies a range of 'autopilot' opponents. There are league teams who are often as good, or even better, than the players' lineups and also sandlot teams.&#10;&#10;Event cards add a lot to almost any the game. They can be played either before your weekly scheduled game or during the game itself. Their effects are wide ranging; from new gadget plays that can give you an extra dice on offense, to sponsorship deals that enable you to sell out to local government for big money. There are college players, fan loyalty, rain insurance, scams, scandals, intrigue and even subtle stuff like players' agents, loyalty and defections.&#10;&#10;Once you have played the game, you work out the gate receipts, which are divided between the home team and the visitors based on a pre-agreed percentage split. There are variables such as number of star players on show, rain, home opener, whether you are playing a winning team, etc. As it is more profitable to be at home (no travel expenses) and to play the winning teams with the most star players, each team has an inherent draw factor - remember this is pre-TV - and can negotiate and earn high income accordingly. Want to play the top rated Canton Bulldogs (8-0-2, three star players) at home? You are going to have to offer their boss a healthy enticement to come to Oolong and perform against your 0-5 Indians, just to earn some money to pay off your overdraft.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, having pocketed your share of the take, you must pay all the players their salaries and if you can't meet the payroll, you will start to lose staff. They may stay on out of the goodness of their hearts, but you also need to apply to the league for a stay of financial execution and avoid bankruptcy. All this links into the league structure. If you have any sort of claim against your opponent you may appeal and have your rival reprimanded or fined, and always at the back of your mind is simply surviving game to game. You must maintain a winning record, you need to find new players to satisfy the butcher's bill of game injuries and, if you survive all that and play nine games well, you'll get a shot at the league title. Interestingly, the game can be won by other means than just having the best record. The team with the most money also gets a point, and a winning season will accrue another. It is unlikely that with a title win you'll lose, but there will be teams close on your tail.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.37766;2.25
612;Kippit;"A game of balance.  Players place wooden blocks on a wooden seesaw trying to get it to tip.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 22 wooden blocks and tries to become the first player to get rid of all their blocks.  The blocks come in 4 different sizes (each size is a different color).&#10;&#10;On your turn, you place blocks in a single stack on the high side of the seesaw.  You have to keep placing blocks until either the seesaw tips or the stack you are building collapses.  If you tip the seesaw and then blocks fall off, those blocks are given to your opponent. However, if the stack collapses before the seesaw tips, then you get stuck with any blocks that fall onto the table.&#10;&#10;In either case, any blocks that stay on the seesaw are left there to complicate future turns.&#10;&#10;Steady hands and a little knowledge of physics helps.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.95435;1.0
613;Overboard;"This game is one of a series of 2 player strategy games by Lakeside from the 1970's, also including Blockade, Trespass, and Isolation.  In Overboard, the &quot;Slide to Survive&quot; game, the board is a 7x7 grid of squares with slots between them to create a grid of 6x6 or 36 playing positions. There are 36 pieces, 18 red, 18 white, which are placed on the intersections between the squares; they have little knobs which hold them in the slots.  On his turn, a player uses one of his pieces to push a row of his opponent's pieces off the board, a la Kuba.  The winner is the last player with pieces on the board.&#10;&#10;";1977;5.70476;1.8
614;Rubik's Race;"A real time game reminiscent of Alex Randolph's Square Off but using Rubik's cube colors as a basis.&#10;&#10;In this game players race to complete a puzzle.  Each player has a 5x5 slide puzzle with one tile missing.  At the beginning of each round, the &quot;Scrambler&quot;, a device that looks like a 3x3 Boggle grid with the cover on -- but using colored cubes instead of letters -- is shaken.  Players then try to make the 3x3 center of their puzzle match the Scrambler.&#10;&#10;";1982;6.04924;1.25
615;Double Decker;"The game includes a playing board with a 3x3 grid and 12 playing pieces.  Each piece consists of two cubes, each with marbles in the center - one red, one green.  Players take turns placing pieces on the board, trying to make a specified pattern in his color but not his opponent's -- all the while having to play both his color and his opponent's color each turn.  There are several different games explained in the rules: make 3, 4, or 5 in a row (in 3D) before your opponent, form a square in your color, form more three-in-a-row alignments than your opponent, etc.&#10;&#10;Eight games are:&#10;Game 1: 3D tic Tac Toe or 2 in a Box&#10;Game 2: Move 3 in a Row&#10;Game 3: 3D Four Square&#10;Game 4: &quot;3D tic Tac Toe or 4 in a Row&#10;Game 5: Variation on &quot;3D tic Tac Toe or 4 in a Row&quot;&#10;Game 6: Binary Doodle&#10;Game 7: 4-Square on the Level&#10;Game 8: Recluse Puzzle&#10;&#10;";1968;5.5;2.0
616;What's That on My Head?;"What's that on my head? is a deduction game where players can see everyone else's cards save for their own.  Each turn players read off a question and answer it according to what they see on everyone's cards.  Eventually this gives players enough information to deduce what is on their own cards and winning a point.&#10;&#10;The cards that the players have to guess show different numbers. Variations of the game uses letters (What's That on My Head? &amp; Egghead) and numbers combined with colors (Code 777).

617;Alles Futsch;"The object of this game is to be the player with the most cash left when one other player goes bankrupt.&#10;&#10;Each player receives:&#10;1 play-table, which is placed face up in front of him&#10;4 marker stones&#10;Money worth 200,000 (3 x 50,000, 2 x 20,000, 1 x 5000, and 5 x 1000)&#10;&#10;The card holder is placed in the center of the table.&#10;The remaining cash is sorted and laid out in the bank..&#10;The object cards are shuffled and placed in the card holder.&#10;&#10;The top 5 cards are laid openly next to each other beside the card holder.&#10;&#10;If there are fewer than 5 players, the remaining play-tables and marker stones are placed back in the box.&#10;&#10;Play: Starting player selects one of the five face up cards for auction.&#10;&#10;Each player must increase the bids. Beginning with the player who selected the object card, in as many rounds as needed. Bids must increase by 1000 or a multiple thereof. Once a player passes, he may not re-enter this auction.&#10;&#10;The highest bidder pays the bank and receives the object card. The player may make change with the bank. The card will have 3 objects on it. The purchaser now has to distribute each of those objects.&#10;&#10;Three possibilities  exist for the card, each of the three objects on the card are used one at a time in any sequence desired.&#10;&#10;The sequence is decided by the player who paid for the card. Each item is released after it is used:&#10;&#10;1. An object for which he has only 0-2 copies in his collection: in this case he must take the object into his own collection. He sets one mark on the first field of the item or shifts it to the right to the next field. If this is the third type of an item, he immediately receives a bonus of 30000 from the bank.&#10;&#10;2. An object for which he already 3 or more copies in its collection. In this case he sells the object to any fellow player who has from 0-4 copies of the object in his collection. The fellow player cannot reject the purchase and must pay the seller 20000. The buyer moves his marker to the appropriate field. If this causes the marker to move to the third position, he should immediately receive a bonus of 30,000 marks from the bank.&#10;&#10;Note: the fourth and fifth objects of a type are thus always sold; one never receives these two objects from an object card that they have won for auction.&#10;&#10;Buying more than 3 types of art makes ones collection decrease in value. The buyer must pay the seller the fixed purchase price of 20000 marks and he must also pay 10,000 marks to the bank.&#10;&#10;3. A type of object which is not on his play-table (recognizably from the colored beam on his play-table at the bottom left hand corner). In this case, the auction winner sells such objects - as under 2 as described  to other players&#10;&#10;The object card is placed face up in the second side of the card holder after its 3 objects are distributed among the players.&#10;&#10;The top face down card is turned up and added to the remaining 4 face up cards.&#10;&#10;The player who purchased the last card, selects the next card to auction.&#10;&#10;The game ends the moment one of the players goes broke.&#10;&#10;First the fellow player is paid off, then the bank and then buyer receives any possible bonus.&#10;The winner is the player who has the most cash.

619;The Bottle Imp;"In this trick-taking game based on the short story by Robert Louis Stevenson of the same name, the goal is to gain the most points over a series of hands (usually the goal is set to 200 pts). Cards are numbered 1-37 and are found in three colors, red (comprising largely the highest numbers), blue (mostly in the middle) and yellow (mostly the lowest numbers) with colors being analogous to the suit in a standard deck.  There is one neutral card, the 19, that sets the &quot;price of the bottle.&quot;&#10;&#10;The entire deck is dealt to the three or four players in the game and then, similarly to hearts, cards are exchanged and a card is played to the bottle.  As per the usual elements of a trick taking game, players must follow suit if possible with high card taking the trick (regardless of suit).  The unique feature about this game however is how trump is determined.  Any card of value lower than the current price of the bottle (starting with 19) is considered &quot;trump&quot; and will win the trick.  If multiple cards are less than the current bottle price, the card valued closest to the current price (so highest card below the bottle) takes the trick AND THE BOTTLE, the bottle price is adjusted by the player taking the card that represents the current bottle price and replacing it with the card they used to win the trick.  Thus the price of the bottle will decrease with each trump card played, and the bottle is increasingly harder to win/purchase.  Ownership of the bottle will pass from player to player and the number of possible trump cards will decrease both as a factor of cards being played and cards being skipped as the bottle price descends.  One player will be stuck with the bottle at the end of a hand (when players have played all the cards in their hands).&#10;&#10;Cards have point values from 1-6 (not directly based on numerical value), at the end of the hand players will score points for the cards of tricks they've won, except the player who holds the bottle who will score NEGATIVE points for all the cards played to the bottle at the beginning, scoring nothing for the cards they won during the hand.  Play continues until the point goal is reached.&#10;&#10;In the 2003 edition the complete story by R.L. Stevenson http://gaslight.mtroyal.ab.ca/bottlimp.htm is included (in both English &amp; German) and the bottle is a nice wooden piece.  Earlier versions had a stand-up cardboard piece that you cut out.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.73674;1.8659
620;We the People;"We the People was the first in what has become a very popular trend for wargaming.  The typically hex-based maps were simplified into an abstract system of connected spaces, which are used for army movement and to keep track of who controls the provinces politically.  The armies themselves are greatly simplified, but the general in charge of the army gains much importance through his ratings for combat effectiveness and overall strategic effectiveness.  Typically, dice are used to resolve conflicts between troops, however a deck of battle cards are used instead, which captures the feel of conflict much better and gives approximately the same results seemingly without the bitterness that accompanies skewed die rolls.  And lastly, the overall ebb and flow of the game is determined through the play of strategy cards, which ostensibly mark certain historical events during the Revolutionary War, but each card has multiple purposes depending on which side is attempting to use it.&#10;&#10;";1993;7.30396;2.7055
621;25 Words or Less;"In 25 Words or Less, players divide up into two teams. The current clue-giver on each team looks at a list of five words that they're going to have to get their teammates to say using only words (a.k.a., no sounds or gestures). The clue-givers bid on the number of words that they need to say to accomplish the feat, with the lower bid getting the honor of doing so. If the team cannot successfully name the words in the allotted time and with the bid number of words (or less), then the other team gets the point. The first team to collect ten points wins.&#10;&#10;Won Games Magazine Game of the Year award in 1997.&#10;&#10;";1996;6.58131;1.5102

Who can get the best deal?&#10;&#10;Game 2: Boneyard There are buckets of money on the table, and it's a silent auction to grab them. Your bids fall back into the buckets, and the first player who can get far enough ahead wins.&#10;&#10;Game 3: Diminishing Returns Simple, elegant, and the best of the set. Players start with the same collection of bills, and play money into a common pot until all but one player is out.

Each turn, a set of colored chips are auctioned off for each player, however, the number of chips and color combinations are different.  Players simultaneously bid some of their bankroll to determine what order they'll pick their set.

629;Q-Turn;"Q-Turn is a fast and unpredictable little game played on a dynamic board made up of 16 wooden nickels. The game is packaged very efficiently, in a small clear plastic tube, along with a rules sheet and four small flat tokens. Q-Turn is thus highly portable, and can be played on any flat surface, from the lunch counter to an airline tray table.&#10;&#10;The game is played by randomizing the disks and placing them face down on the table in a 4x4 pattern. Tokens are placed at the corners, with the goal being to move your token to the opposite corner and back again before your opponents. As the tokens move across the board, disks are flipped over, revealing arrows that indicate which way a token may move next. Each type of disk allows a different special action, rotating one or all of the disks a quarter turn, thus changing the available paths across the board.&#10;&#10;A quarter-turn here, and a quarter-turn there, and soon everyone may be headed off in the wrong direction!&#10;&#10;Microbadge&#10;&#10; Buy It&#10;&#10;";1999;5.05521;1.2308
630;Double Quick;"A word game where quick thinking pays off.  Up to 4 players build a crossword out of their tiles.  Every 30 seconds or so, a timer goes off and each player must draw 2 tiles and add them to their crossword.  Using a letter in 2 words scores double points for that letter.  Infrequently used letters (e.g. x,q,z) score higher amounts of points but are harder to use in your crossword.&#10;&#10;";1999;7.0814;1.5
631;Daytona 500;"Six little plastic cars race around the big Daytona track.  The track is three spaces wide except for a sweeping curve at either end.  In the curves, the track narrows to two lanes.  The outer lane is a passing lane, requiring twice as many movement points to use and in which a car may not end its turn.  Movement points come from play of the special deck of cards.  Selecting a card from your hand, you move each of the cars on the card the prescribed number of spaces, trying to position your own car or cars most advantageously while leaving your opponents blocked.  Before each race, the six cars are auctioned off, and you bid for them based on the cards in your hand.  Payout is based on where your car(s) finished in the race.  Most money wins.&#10;&#10;Suggested game length is three races (each race lasts about 20 minutes), enough to give the luck of the draw a chance to even out.&#10;&#10;";1990;7.13822;1.7788
632;Cloud 9;"Cloud 9 - The Daring Game of Ups and Downs&#10;&#10;Players earn points by daring to stay in the basket of a hot air balloon as it rises. Points increase as the balloon climbs from cloud to cloud, but so does the risk of the balloon falling. Should you jump out to save your points or trust that the pilot will take you safely higher?&#10;&#10;Everyone places their passenger token into the balloon's basket to start the trip, and receives a hand of six balloon cards. Then, each turn, a different &quot;pilot&quot; rolls an increasing number of specialized dice to see if the balloon can stay aloft. The dice dictate how many of the balloon cards are needed of each color. (There are also optionally played Wild Cards to keep everyone guessing.) Each player decides whether they think the pilot will have the cards to successfully take the balloon up, or whether they should jump out and keep the points earned so far. If they stay, they run the risk of getting no points if the pilot fails. If the balloon does fall, it is placed back on the lowest cloud. Everyone hops aboard and draws one new card, and the next trip begins. When a player earns 50 points the game is over.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.48952;1.1527
633;Elixir;"Players collect ingredients cards in order to cast spells, and the first player to get rid of all of their spells wins the game.  So far so good.  The bad news is, the cards require between 1 and 4 ingredients.  Spells requiring 3 or 4 ingredients might actually help you win the game.  Spells requiring 1 or 2 ingredients cause another player to perform a forfeit, e.g proposing to another player.&#10;&#10;Expanded by&#10;&#10;    Elixir:  Alambic&#10;    Elixir: Mandragore&#10;    Elixir: Alchimie&#10;&#10;&#10;";1997;5.59428;1.4713
634;River Dragons;"In Dragon Delta, you want to move your pawn over a system of bridge-like planks to the other side of the board. An easy task! Or at least it would be if everyone were working together, but alas you're not. Instead you're all working on your own right next to one another, each convinced that your way is best.&#10;&#10;In game terms, players simultaneously select five action cards to be performed from the nine actions available and lay them down in order they are to be played. The turn is then resolved one card at a time. The actions allow players to place plank foundations, place planks, move their pawns, cancel other players' actions, or remove planks or foundation stones. As can be expected for a design with simultaneous action selection, the game is rather chaotic.&#10;&#10;The 2012 edition of the game, River Dragons, includes a double-sided game board not present in earlier editions, with one side of the board featuring rock piles on which you place stones (as in the original Dragon Delta), while the other side has a featureless river on which players can place stones in any location.&#10;&#10;";2000;6.49158;1.7195
635;Formula Motor Racing;"In this light racing card game the players must try to maneuver their team of 2 racing cars into the podium positions over a series of races by playing cards to manipulate the line of vehicles to their advantage.&#10;&#10;Players can advance their position by playing cards that move their vehicles up the line or drag other team cars back. More powerful cards may require the roll of a dice and can result in great gains or disastrous engine blow-outs that can put cars out of the race and cannot rejoin the fray until the next race begins.&#10;&#10;Play is quick and simple with players required to play one action per turn, carry out its effects and drawing a card to end their turn. Each race will end after the draw deck is exhausted with one final turn taking place. Points are then awarded for positions 1-6 and a leaderboard is recorded. As the game evolves the leaderboard will be forever changing and in the final race the drivers will know what they have to do to earn the points in order to sit atop the final standings!&#10;&#10;";1995;6.4124;1.1801
636;Blindside;"A Nomination Whist variant that is played with an odd deck of cards. The deck contains the four regular suits, but each has 2 Kings, 2 Queens and 3 Jacks, 3 '10's and 3 '9's. There are also four jokers, which &#10;count as the highest trump. At the end of each hand, the players score a point for each trick made, with a&#10;bonus of ten if you make exactly as many tricks as you bid. If you bid zero and made no tricks, you score&#10;20 points - which makes zero very valuable. The game ends when any player reaches 77 points at the end&#10;of a hand: the player with the most points wins.  Each hand starts with dealing out the entire deck. Each&#10;player uses one face down card as a bid for the trump suit.  If one suit has more cards than any other,&#10;this suit becomes trumps for the hand. If not, the hand is played as No Trumps. There is a clear trade-off&#10;here between getting the suit you want as trumps and retaining as many cards as possible in the suit.&#10;However, it can also be a useful way of reducing your holding in a particular suit. Or even throwing away &#10;a high card that would otherwise win a trick, if you are going to bid zero tricks.  Once the trump suit has &#10;been determined, each player, starting to the left of dealer, states how many tricks they expect to take.&#10;This gives an interesting advantage to the dealer.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.30526;2.0

Each card in it can be an event (a yellow flag, crash, blown engine) or simply a lap count which players must attain for that turn.  Each player has a driver deck which they draw from to make a hand.  They play cards each turn to reach the lap count.

638;Hera and Zeus;"Players are opposing gods from Greek mythology, Hera and Zeus, bent on destroying each other because each kidnapped the other's favorite mortal. Players lay out cards in opposite three-column, four-row matrices. Cards on the leading edges of the opposing columns can be used to attack, which means the combat value of the cards are compared and the loser is destroyed. However, cards are played facedown until they're engaged, adding an element of bluff and doubt to the game. Each turn, players have as many actions as they have columns, and actions can be used to attack, draw cards, or play special action cards. To win, you need to reduce the other player to zero columns, capture their hostage card from their hand, or make sure your opponent cannot use all of their actions during their turn.&#10;&#10;Hera &amp; Zeus is part of the Kosmos two-player series.&#10;&#10;";2000;6.48357;2.0479
639;American Megafauna;"From the designer/publisher:&#10;&#10;A quarter of a billion years ago, an unknown catastrophe engulfs the Earth. The swamps and ice caps of the Permian are replaced by the blistering deserts of the Triassic. On both land and sea, 96% of the animal species die.&#10;&#10;In the corner of Pangea that will be known as America, small survivors cautiously sniff the post-holocaust air at the dawn of the Mesozoic Era. Some of these unspecialized  quadrupeds have sloppy ever-replacing reptile teeth, these will be the dinosaurs. Others have sculpted &quot;one-shot&quot; teeth, these will be the mammals. The victor in this titanic  ecological struggle will determine the masters of the planet.&#10;&#10;Clearly, the ruling reptiles triumphed since that day, 248 million years ago, and dominated for 170 million years. Only to be overthrown, in what must be the upset of the eon, by the  mammals. Yet the contest is not over.&#10;&#10;American Megafauna pits dinosaurs against mammals in ancient America. The game is designed for two to four players, from  ages 9 to adult, or can be played solitaire. It recreates the titanic contest of these two types of prehistoric beasts from the  Triassic to the present.&#10;&#10;This is a game of ecology, evolution, and DNA. Players start as one of four nondescript archetypes, but can branch out to new species from this basic type by bidding on genotype and DNA cards as they are revealed. For auction &quot;currency,&quot; players use  gene coins from a &quot;gene pool.&quot; DNA cards allow players to create strange animals, from cud-chewing crocodiles with antlers, to  saber-tooth meat-eating camels.&#10;&#10;In the advanced version, the continent of Laurentia is occasionally flooded or glaciated; greenhouse levels change; and the three Milankovich cycles are handled by cards that occur with historical probabilities. Biome cards, including cicada prairies, mountains, ice sheets, and mangrove swamps, appear on the map in succession according to &quot;climax&quot; ratings.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    American Megafauna  (Second Edition): Expansion Set&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Bios: Megafauna&#10;&#10;&#10;";1997;6.84871;3.8163
642;Oodles;"Oodles is made up of three main items... a nifty ticking electronic timer that stops when you hold the button down and starts up again when you let go of it, an extraneous plastic Oodle stick (a large &quot;start player&quot; marker), and a deck of Oodle cards.&#10;&#10;Each card has 10 questions on it, plus a &quot;Silly Starter.&quot; The &quot;silly&quot; question is asked to the player currently holding the Oodle stick and if he/she answers correctly, they begin answering the questions on the card (each answer begins with the same letter). You are allowed only one guess... so if you're wrong, the moderator calls an &quot;all play&quot; and reads the question again. The first player to guess correctly wins the right to keep answering questions on the card - in case of ties, the tied players both take a shot at the next question. The player who answers the last question correctly gets the card... and five cards wins the game. (If the moderator is passing from person to person, if no one gets the last question, the moderator gets the card.)&#10;&#10;The joy of the game is in the odd crossword puzzle-like clues:&#10;  Q: Cowboy questionnaire&#10;  A: Gallup Poll&#10;  Q: A very serious hole&#10;  A: Grave&#10;  Q: Where they regularly hang painters&#10;  A: Gallery&#10;&#10;Q: Word to describe a naked grizzly&#10;  A: Bare&#10;  Q: Fish with a very deep voice&#10;  A: Bass&#10;&#10;Q: How to get around a circle&#10;  A: Circumference&#10;  Q: Lahr's Lion&#10;  A: Cowardly&#10;  Q: What the farmer does to his photos&#10;  A: Crops&#10;&#10;";1992;6.0869;1.3684
643;Deadlands: Doomtown Range Wars;"Doomtown: Range Wars is a customizable disc game.  Each of the boxed sets contains 8 sheets of die-cut discs which may contain an assortment of combat markers, weapons and ammo, spells, cowboys, supernatural adversaries, terrain, buildings, and more. The starter set also includes a rulebook, and everything needed to play.  These sets were produced in 2000 by Fantasy Flight Games, and are set in the Deadlands game world of the wild west (but there are other themes that use the same disc mechanism).&#10;&#10;This game uses full-color illustrated discs to represent the cowboys, supernatural beings, buildings, and other accessories used in the game.  The discs are used to wage gunfights and large-scale western battles.  The discs each have game stats such as: pistol/rifle skill, hand-to-hand combat, movement, leadership, wounds, and special abilities which can help or hinder combat. This game is similar in style to many military wargames, except that the counters are much larger (1.5 to 4 inches in diameter!), allowing for amazing full-color unit illustrations, and detailed special abilities like those seen in fantasy card games.&#10;&#10;";2000;6.29207;2.2
644;Shipwrecked;"You are Shipwrecked... to survive, you must compete head-to-head in a bid for food, shelter, water, and friends. These entertaining contests require strategy, intuition, and nerve to determine who survives and who doesn't.&#10;   &#10;This is an auction bidding game. Each round, the lead off player flips over a card from the deck which will then be auctioned off. There are also Hidden Resource cards in the deck. When one comes up, players bid for the next card in the deck without knowing what it is!  Each player has 6 bid markers: 3 Pass, 2 Stop, and 1 Strike. Each round of each auction, a player must place one of these markers face down. The first round, the markers are placed in the '5 position'. This means if the auction is stopped at this position, the winner pays 5 for the item. If no one stops the auction, players place a marker in the '4 position'. Once again, if the auction is stopped, the winner pays 4 for the item. These rounds continue until the auction is stopped, or until the auction moved to the last '0 position'. Once the auction for that item is complete, the deck passes to the next player. Each time the deck comes to a player, he collects income as listed on each item card he owns. He may then choose to place an item sold back to the bank up for auction, or draw one from the deck to be auctioned. One thing that makes Shipwrecked stand out from other auction games is that you can't 'not bid'. You must participate in the auction, even if you really don't want the item.&#10;&#10;";2000;5.70746;1.4681

646;Pirate's Plunder;"Pirate's Plunder is a card and dice game in which players take on the roles of pirates and engage in a life of swashbuckling adventure on the high seas.&#10;&#10;The game is played in turns.  At the start of the game, each player starts off in a lifeboat.  They have to steal a pirate ship (based on the result of a dice roll), otherwise, they are stuck in the lifeboat and have to skip their turn.  When they have a ship, players draw Playing Cards into their hand.  These cards offer maps for treasures, events to modify a pirate's guns and crews, and other ways to bend the rules of the game.&#10;&#10;A pirate's score is reflected by his treasure, which comes from the wealth-laden ships, loot, and hostages in the form of Treasure Cards.  These cards are drawn from their deck when a pirate plays a map in hand, or by making a successful &quot;Sail Ho!&quot; dice roll during their turn.  Pirates can bury their treasure to keep them safe, although they have to dig it up for it to be counted as score.&#10;&#10;Some Treasure Cards, however, are perils in the forms of deadly pirates (such as Blackbeard) and naval warships.  Players can play perils on fellow pirates, forcing them to engage in combat.  Players can also engage other players in battle as well during a successful &quot;Sail Ho!&quot; dice roll if they choose to do so instead of drawing Treasure Cards.  Such battles are resolved by comparing dice rolls, which are added to the player's number of guns or crew.  The loser's ship is sunk and the player has to start his or her subsequent turns in a lifeboat.  The winner also takes the loser's unburied treasure.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a pirate has 3,000 or more pieces of eight worth of unburied treasure and makes a successful dice roll to &quot;Sail Home&quot;, thus becoming the winner.&#10;&#10;";2000;4.56311;1.5

651;Zero Down;"How low can you go? In Zero, you want to score as few points as possible, but to do that you need to collect the right cards in hand.&#10;&#10;The deck consists of 56 cards, with cards numbered 1-8 in seven colors. Each player starts with nine cards in hand, and five, seven or nine cards start face-up on the table depending on the number of players. On a turn, you either knock on the table to pass or you swap one card in hand for one card on the table. After the second knock, whether from the same player or a different one, all players other than the second knocker have one final chance to swap, after which they reveal and score their hands. If you have five or more cards of the same color or number in hand, then those cards score 0 points. For each other number you have, no matter how many copies, you score points equal to that card's value. Thus, having one to four 7s in hand is worth 7 points.&#10;&#10;If, however, you manage to collect both five cards of a color and five cards of a number in hand (with one card fitting in both sets), then you can declare &quot;Zero!&quot; and end the round immediately, with everyone else scoring points as usual.&#10;&#10;After a number of rounds equal to the number of players, whoever has the lowest score wins!&#10;&#10;";1998;6.47892;1.2364

653;Shit!;"It is a game where everyone simultaneously plays a unique number face down card a la Take 5 (6 Nimmt).&#10;&#10;There are 5 suits arranged in a circular pattern. The idea is you score the points based on the first person to hit their number traveling clockwise after the current number, e.g. if the colors are Green, Blue, Red, Yellow, Orange, Green, Blue, etc. and the current target card is Orange 6, then the first number after orange 6 wins a number of points equal to the interval. For example, orange 7 would win 1 point, but if it were not there and Green 1 were next closest, it would win 5 points. If the next closest card were orange 5 (unlikely but possible), it would score 49 points.&#10;&#10;Each player also always has in hand a Shit! card which cannot score, but playing it is the only way to get another card in hand. Strategy comes from watching when people play cards and how many they have left. Time it right and you can play while everyone else is drawing for monster points.&#10;&#10;It's a fun 20 minutes.

Players are given a set of square cards which are to be played onto the table, which has a cardboard castle battlement layout. Cards are played into one of four regions: in the courtyard, on the battlements, on the towers, or outside the castle. And when played, the cards will usually allow you to take some sort of special action, which is unique to the card you played.

657;MÃ¼nchhausen;"A pure bluffing game. Each player gets a set of cards numbered 1 to 8 and a playing mat, which goes in front of him or her. The starting player is the Baron and the other players in turn offer him a card face down from their hand, stating the value. Each player must offer an equal or higher value card than the last and the Baron must take the highest card offered or choose between equal offers. The Baron must then decide to Accept or Reject the offer. If he accepts, the Baron puts the card face down on his mat and the turn passes to the next player. But if the Baron decides the player was lying and Rejects the offer, he turns the card over. If the offer was False, the player takes it back to their hand and the Baron gets to dump one of his cards onto his mat. But if it was True, The Baron must take the card into his hand and the player dumps a card face down. When a player's hand is empty, the game is over and you total the value of the cards on your mat, subtracting any left in your hand. Highest score wins. A simple game of pure bluff, it works incredibly well. Very funny and requires some thought. Baron Muenchausen is a famous character from German folklore, a notorious liar who lived a fantastical life. The game mats show illustrations and stories from his life in German, but this has nothing to do with the actual game play and non-German readers can play the game easily.&#10;&#10;";1996;5.89414;1.0833
660;Riffifi;"From session report:&#10;A card game. The deck consists of five  different colored sets of cards, each set numbered 1 - 8. There are  also five matching sets of wooden disks, 10 of each color.&#10;&#10;The cards are dealt out equally to the players and they alternate playing one card face-up to the table. Unlike a trick-taking game, there is no need to follow suit; players may play any card they desire. If a player lays a card of the same color and a LOWER value as a previously laid card that round, the higher card is turned over and is out of play. When play returns to a player who still has his card face-up in front of him, he collects a number of chips from the stockpile which matches the number and color of the card he played. If his card is face-down, however, he does not collect any chips. In either case, he plays another card and the cycle continues until the players have played all of their cards.&#10;&#10;When collecting chips, if the stockpile of a certain color is depleted, the player then steals the required number and color of chips from the opponent who currently possesses the most chips of that color. Thus, each player's collection of chips is constantly in danger of being confiscated by their opponents.&#10;&#10;The basic rules call for a number of rounds equal to the number of players, with the player collecting the greatest cumulative total of chips over those rounds being the victor.&#10;&#10;";2000;6.14861;1.0
661;Where's Bob's Hat?;"A form of estimation whist, with three colored suits (cards from 1 to 20), and the possibility of trumps or no-trumps.   You have to bid for which suit (or suits) you think you will capture most cards of, or you can bid to capture fewer cards than anyone else.   Get it right, you score; get it wrong, you take a penalty.   The number of cards per hand increases round by round, and the number of rounds depends on the number of players.&#10;&#10;From the Box:&#10;Where's Bob's Hat? is best with 3 or 4 players. Over several hands, players bid to take the most cards in one or more of the three suits, each a different kind of hat. Players who feel they will take few, if any, tricks may bid to take the fewest cards in tricks played during each hand. Players score points for making their bids and lose points for missing their bids.&#10;&#10;Several cards picture Bob's Hat in addition to the hat of their suit. When a player wins a trick containing a card with Bob's Hat on it, the player takes the Bob's Hat card (worth plus or minus 10 points). The player with the card at the end of the hand add (or subtracts) 10 points to his score. The player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner!&#10;&#10;";1990;6.22494;1.6

666;Stump;"The game uses a ring numbered from 1 to 40 with sliders on it. At the start, the sliders are set randomly (by card draw). On your turn, you draw a card, then play a &quot;gapper&quot; if possible (a gapper is a card falling between the numbers where the sliders rest, as indicated by the sliders' arrowheads), and finally discard a card, moving a slider to the discards number. There are wild cards in the deck.&#10;&#10;If a player goes out, he wins 5 points plus one point per card still held by the other players. 25 points wins the game.&#10;&#10;";1968;6.40857;1.0

668;Sternenhimmel;"Each player vies for control of the constellations which are worth victory points. There are 12 constellations and players use &quot;Stars&quot; to bid for the control. Each star is worth some amount of control over the constellation, and there is a &quot;Double&quot; star and a &quot;Black Hole&quot; star thrown into the mix. There is some aspect of bluff in the game since some of your stars may be placed face up or down.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.56557;2.0811
669;Plague & Pestilence;"A light card game involving the build-up and destruction of medieval towns. In the &quot;Prosperity&quot; phase, players attempt to build up their populations via stealing from other players or via improvements. Then the Death Ship arrives bearing the plague! In the &quot;Plague&quot; phase, players attempt to kill other players by playing war, pestilence, or other deadly attacks. The cards contain illustrations reminiscent of medieval woodcuts featuring the Grim Reaper.&#10;&#10;";1993;6.21681;1.3816
670;Starship Troopers;"Starship Troopers is based upon the popular novel of the same name written by the dean of Science-Fiction writers, Robert A. Heinlein. In the novel, Heinlein describes a futuristic war involving homo sapiens from our Earth (Terrans) against a Humanoid race (nicknamed the 'Skinnies' for obvious physical attributes) and their cobelligerents, the totally alien Arachnids. Since this is a story of future wars and future advances in technology, much is changed in the fields of weaponry and tactics and strategy. One thing remains the same, however; the fighting still rests on the shoulders of the individual infantryman. Although great starships has shuttle men between the distant solar systems and the power of individual weapons has risen to awesome heights, wars still cannot be won unless men venture onto the face of alien planets and fight the enemy on their home ground. As Juan Rico, the protagonist of the novel, relates:&#10;&#10;&quot;We are the boys who go to a particular place, at H-Hour, occupy a designated terrain, stand on it, dig the enemy out of their holes, force them then and there to surrender or die. We're the bloody infantry, the doughboy, the duckfoot, the foot soldier who goes where the enemy is and takes him on in person.&quot;&#10;&#10;Although the mission remains the same, future inventiveness has changed the method considerably. In a galaxy-wide war, manpower is at a premium. Platoons fight where entire armies once tred. But these platoons possess the firepower equivalence of a Twentieth-Century mechanized division. More importantly, each man in the platoon is provided with a piece of hardware that allows him to fight and survive in the holocausts of future combat&mdash;his powered armor suit. As Rico describes it:&#10;&#10;&quot;A suit isn't a spacesuit &mdash; although it can serve as one. A suit is not a space ship but it can fly&mdash;a little . . . Suited up, you look like a big steel gorilla, armed with gorillasized weapons. But the suits are considerably stronger than a gorilla. If a Mobile Infantry man in a suit swapped hugs with a gorilla, the gorilla would be dead, crushed; the man and the suit wouldn't be mussed . . . The real genius in the design is that you don't have to control the suit, you just wear it, like your clothes, like skin . . . Even riding a bicycle demands an acquired skill, very different from walking. But a suit you just wear.&quot;&#10;&#10;With the suit and the incredible array of weaponry that go with it, the Mobile Infantry soldier is an exceedingly formidable opponent. He had better be. The enemies he faces are the most awesome adversaries in the galaxy. Of the two extraterrestrial races fighting the Terrans, the Humanoids are the least revolting. Rico describes them as&#10;&#10;&quot; . . . humanoid, eight or nine feet tall, much skinnier than we are and with a higher body temperature; they don't wear any clothes and they stand out in a set of 'snoopers' like a neon sign.&quot;&#10;&#10;In early scenarios they are fighting on the side of the Arachnids.  In later scenarios, after successful negotiations with Earth, they switch over to the Terran side. They're only effective fighters within the confines of their small city terrain and strong points on the board.&#10;&#10;But the 'Skinnies' were mild looking in comparison to the Arachnids:&#10;&#10;&quot;The 'Bugs' are not like us. The Pseudo-Arachnids aren't even like spiders. They are arthropods who happen to look like a madman's concept of a giant, intelligent spider, but their organization, psychological and economic, is more like that of ants or termites; they are communal entities, the ultimate dictatorship of the hive . . . But don't make the mistake of thinking that they act purely from instinct . . . their actions are as intelligent as ours (stupid races don't build spaceships!) and were much better coordinated. It takes a minimum of a year to train a private to fight and to mesh his fighting with his mates; a Bug warrior is hatched able to do this ...&quot;&#10;&#10;As the Arachnid Player, uses an Alien Control Pad sheet to record the placement of his underground central Hive cell complex and the attached tunnels radiating outward. Tunnels are used to move the Warrior units, along with Worker units mixed in as expendable decoys, to locations where they can pop up to the surface through a breach hole and attack the Terran units.  Completely unseen, and only paper recorded, Engineer units are used to create the breaches and, later, to extend the tunnels.&#10;&#10;The game is set up in a &quot;Programmed Instruction&quot; system of scenarios to slowly introduce the game concepts. Scenarios range from Scenario I, which starts players off with a basic MI raid on a Skinny city (just like the book. &quot;Flores died on the way up&quot;) to Scenario VII, The Battle of Klendathu: the final Terran assault on the Arachnid Homeworld.&#10;&#10;Warfare in the Twenty-second Century is the ultimate test of survivability of the human race.

671;Bull Run: The First Major Battle of the American Civil War;"&quot;Bull Run: The First Major Battle of the American Civil War&quot; is a tactical combat wargame of the first battle of Bull Run.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a map of the area over which the battle was fought overlaid with a hexagonal grid. Units are infantry, cavalry, and artillery, with brigade, division, and army leaders. Each turn is 30 minutes, and each hex represents 1000 ft. Units are basically regiments and batteries. Some infantry regiments with their brigade leader are capable of forming brigades, increasing offensive power at the expense of movement. Batteries can be limbered for increased movement at the expense of firepower, or unlimbered with full firepower and limited movement.&#10;&#10;Combat is a modified version of the classic system adopted by the earlier Avalon Hill games.  However, rules for leader command activation, infantry screening of artillery, and infantry forming brigades to prevent soak-off attacks, ranged artillery, rally of losses are give the game a unique flavour.&#10;&#10;The major terrain obstacle is Bull Run which provides the Confederate with defensive advantages and hinders Union movement. &#10; The game begins with the Union troops approaching partially hidden, unsuspecting Confederate forces.  As the Union attack develops, additional Confederate leaders and combat units are activated and are rushed to stem the Union advance.  The Union player wins if he is able to capture any of three objective hexes by the end of the game or takes Manassas at any time.  The Confederate player wins if he takes Centreville at any time or prevents the Union player from holding any of objective hexes at the game end.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a 32&quot; by 22&quot; mapboard, 260 counters, various charts, a 12 page rulebook and 1 die.&#10;&#10;&#10;Magazine References:&#10;&#10;The GENERAL Index  Article List:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The GENERAL Vol.20,No.5&#10;        Series Replay - Bull Run: The First Major Battle of the American Civil War, Rex A.

673;Star Traders;"from user review:&#10;Each player assumes the role of a intra-galactic merchant, traveling from planet to planet in a future where wars are unheard of and &quot;Traders&quot; are the heroes of the cosmos. The board shows 36 planets: six clustered together in the center of the board, six more in each of five arms of the galaxy. Planets are connected by &quot;jump lines&quot;: you can jump to an adjacent planet on an orange line, to a planet halfway down a galaxy arm on a purple line, and from one galaxy arm to another via green lines. The length of the jump line also indicates the difficulty of the jump, so to successfully complete an &quot;orange' jump you must roll a 2 or better on a single die, a purple jump requires a 4 or better, and the green jumps necessitate a 6.&#10;&#10;As the players scurry about the galaxy, they can pick up and deliver cargoes, which pay both in money and in &quot;Prestige.&quot; These &quot;contracts&quot; vary throughout the game, and only one player can fulfill any given contract. This isn't to say that multiple players can't pick up the named cargo, though. But only the first player to arrive at the contract's destination gets the payoff for a contract; everyone else with the cargo is now just stuck with unwanted junk, and may have to pay a penalty to dump it. Players can also build bases on the various planets as they move around. Building bases earns the players Prestige, and when a player tries to make a jump to a planet with a base, the jump is an automatic success if the player has the owner's permission. Traders obviously have permission to jump to their own bases, but if they want to jump to an opponent's, they will probably have to pay a fee. And since only one player can have a base on any given planet, bases rapidly become lucrative investments.&#10;&#10;";1987;6.34702;2.3043

675;4th Dimension;"4th Dimension is a very spacey-looking game with a small circular board divided into sectors each track of which has twice as many spaces as the one closer to the center. Each player get 6 warriors, 3 rangers, 2 guardians, and one time lord. Guardians can capture warriors and rangers; rangers can capture warriors; the time lord can capture rangers and guardians; but the lowly warriors are the only ones who can capture the time lord and win the game. Captures are made by moving next to rather than on top of enemy pieces. Each piece can move only one space at a time but they can also &quot;warp&quot; by leaving the board and leaving a 4-D marker behind. The piece can then stay in the warp zone for up to three turns or warp back onto the board up to two spaces away from the 4-D marker. This game has an inconveniently small gameboard and plastic pieces that look like little futuristic chairs.&#10;&#10;The game was first published in Games &amp; Puzzles magazine. The designers produced it as a standalone game later the same year, and it was later licensed by TSR.&#10;&#10;";1977;5.3747;2.0
676;Ninja Wars;"Proudly touted as a &quot;NON-collectable card game,&quot; Ninja Wars is a simple battle game with single die rolls determining victory. Each player gets three town cards of identical strength and five randomly dealt hero cards with values ranging from 1 to 5. Players are dealt hands of five action cards they can use to attack players towns and heroes or to strengthen their own heroes and towns. Gold cards are also in the action deck which allow players to bolster the value of an attack card. Battling players each roll a die and add the  scores of either their attack and gold cards (for the attacker) or the hero/town and training cards (for the defender). Play is simple and quick for a battle card game. The randomly assigned heroes can create unfair situations, however.&#10;&#10;";1998;4.68129;1.0
677;Would You Rather...?;"Before they can roll and move, players must pick a card and present the rest of the players with a nasty choice between two thoroughly unpleasant hypotheticals in categories such as pain, embarrassment, ethics, and ingestion. If the player guesses the majority preference, he gets to move otherwise he must pass. Some spaces allow the player to invent their own awful hypothetical choice. The other players vote secretly on their choice in this case. If the vote is not unamimous, the player can move or send someone else back. Players roll a six-sided die and there are only 10 spaces to the goal so games go very quickly. Typical choices on the cards include, &quot;Would you rather lie naked in a bathtub full of live roaches or dive head first into a pool of tobacco spit?&quot; The answer &quot;neither&quot; is NEVER allowed.&#10;&#10;Variant:&#10;The 2003 version of this game &quot;Would You Rather?&quot; appears to have quite different rules to the above described game. There is a new simpler square board with more spaces. Unlike the 20 minutes of the above game, 1-2 hours is recommended by the manufacturer. Players roll a dice, then move and depending where they land, draw cards with dilemmas to pose to the rest of the other players. The current player must try to secretly predict the result of the other players' subsequent open discussion and consensus view. No-one is penalised for an inability to reach consensus, the game encourages one option picked at random perhaps by flipping a coin, to keep the game moving. If the current player predicted correctly, they get a bonus turn.&#10;&#10;Typical questions include &quot;Would you rather ... On senior prom night, have to take your parent -OR- your 12 year old sibling?&quot;&#10;&#10;Every so often players get the opportunity to take a difficult challenge with the winner being the first person to complete their third challenge.&#10;&#10;";1998;4.36561;1.1957
678;X-it!;"X-it! is simple mix of &quot;Spite and Malice&quot; (aka Skip-Bo) and solitaire mechanics. There are two decks which each have four suits with 20 cards in each suit. One deck is used to establish a large tableau on a circular gameboard which has 26 card slots around the circumference and four slots forming a central &quot;X&quot;.  The second deck also contains 8 wild cards. Seven cards are dealt to each player from this second deck. The goal is to lay off all the cards in your hand onto one or more of the four &quot;X&quot; cards. The twist is you must be able to dump your entire hand on a single turn. In lieu of this option, a player must try to play a card onto one of the 26 ring cards. Ring and &quot;X&quot; cards must first be &quot;opened&quot; by playing the exact same card on it. After this, cards of any suit may be played on open cards in runs of ascending or descending order. At the end of a turn, a player must play a card even if he was able to discard. If a player puts a card into a run that could have been used to open a card, he loses a turn and must take a penalty card from the player who catches him in the act.&#10;&#10;";1997;4.04883;2.0
679;Minion Hunter;"Minion Hunter is the simplified board game version of GDW's Dark Conspiracy RPG.&#10;&#10;Players move around the outer edge of the board trying to build up their cash, weaponry, equipment and four categories of ability points. In the middle of the board is a map of the USA and a progression track of Dark Minion plots represented by cards, which have city names on the backs and monster names and attack scores on the fronts.&#10;&#10;Once players are strong and rich enough, they can enter the map and fight the enemies shown on the cards that are currently on the track. The enemy cards move down the track after every player turn. If they reach completion, the corresponding Dark Minion (Nukid, ETs, Morlocks, or Fey) gains points toward taking over America.&#10;&#10;Players must boost their own success scores while also cooperating to keep the Dark Minions from snatching victory from all players.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Minion Nation&#10;&#10;&#10;";1992;6.21185;1.8824
680;Dune;"This game should not be confused with the grail game Dune which has the same name (but is based on the book rather than the movie).&#10;&#10;Based on the movie, this version of Dune features photos of the stars on pawns divided into teams of three. Each character has its own strength and guile values. Players can move around the outer desert spaces to harvest monetary units of spice or can move around the inner castle spaces to build up strength. Players can use spice to buy random equipment cards, spice harvesters, or extra boosts of guile when under attack. Players can also invest in the craps-like commodity markets that pay off on certain dice rolls. The artwork is slick, the rules are relatively simple compared to AH's version, and games go fairly quickly since all fights are to the death.&#10;&#10;";1984;5.74106;2.16
681;Quarto;"Quarto has a 4&times;4 board and 16 pieces. Each piece has four dichotomous attributes &mdash; color, height, shape, and consistency &mdash; so each piece is either black or white, tall or short, square or round, and hollow or solid. The object is to place the fourth piece in a row in which all four pieces have at least one attribute in common. The twist is that your opponent gets to choose the piece you place on the board each turn.&#10;&#10;A winner of the 1985 Concours International de Cr&#195;&#169;ateurs de Jeux de Soci&#195;&#169;t&#195;&#169;.&#10;&#10;";1991;6.89935;1.8795

As each piece moves, it literally leaves a paper trail of cardboard chits showing its progress through the game. A piece can be captured at any point on its timeline by landing on a square containing a chit, and any actions taken since then by that piece are reversed. In this way a piece can capture an opposing piece 'earlier' than when that piece captured a friendly piece, thereby returning the friendly piece to the board. The game continues until all four opposing pieces have been captured.&#10;&#10;";1985;6.75;0.0

Instead of a discard pile, each player has his own trade pile. Players can draw from the deck or exchange their trade piles with other players (whether they like it or not).

685;Marrakesh;"Marrakesh was designed by Prince Joli Kansil of Hawaii, the same designer as Bridgette, the two-handed bridge game. Marrakesh is an odd amalgam of backgammon and cardplay which works remarkably well. Each player sets up six pieces on their board based on the roll of six dice. Each player is dealt a hand of six cards from a special deck, and then try to collect two card tricks, using the card values to bear off the pieces. Points are awarded for bearing off pieces in various combinations, such as 2 on each of three turns, or the legendary Marrakesh itself, when all six pieces are borne off on the same turn. Defensive points are earned for keeping the opponent from removing many pieces from their board. Play continues for 12 rounds, which goes by quickly.

Each partnership takes the part of either the Sun or Moon cult, and plays cards only of its designated suit. An interesting mechanic is that since the cards are dealt randomly, it is often necessary and even prudent to have an opponent play a card for you. The object of the game is to collect souls (of either cult) and temples of your own suit (which serve as a multiplier). Rounds move quickly, and points can add up dramatically.

The game is strategic in scale, and units are generic strength points representing Taiping rebels, Manchu banner troops, provincial army troops, bandits and Mongolian cavalry.  The game map represents Manchu China.&#10;&#10;The Taiping player starts at an advantage in troops and leaders and seeks to conquer enough of the country to force a collapse of the Manchu government.  The Manchu player seeks to survive the Taiping onslaught, and gains strength as the provincial forces are brought to bear.  However, over-reliance on provincial forces will cause a reduction of Imperial authority, and that in itself may cause the game to be lost.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a map, playing counters, rules and numerous charts.&#10;&#10;A remake The Dragon and The Cross was published in 2018.&#10;&#10;";1988;6.03871;2.5
689;Dubble Kross;"Dubble Kross uses a regurlar deck of cards, two six-sided dice, 11 plastic pegs and a house-shaped pegboard. Cards 2 through Queen each have a track on the board. Kings, aces and jokers are used as special action cards. After dealing out all the cards, four dice rolls determine the four penalty numbers. Any one who has the corresponding cards in their hands must pay to the kitty. In phase two, each player rolls the dice and either advances the corresponding peg on the board or pays more to the pot if the a penalty number is rolled. Like Parker Bros. &quot;Can't Stop&quot;, the length of each track is proportional to the probability of the roll. Therefore, the  &quot;7&quot; peg must travel the greatest distance while the &quot;2&quot; and &quot;12&quot; (Queen) pegs need only travel three spaces to win. When a peg crosses the finish line unchallenged, each corresponding card in players' hands are worth a quarter of the pot.&#10;&#10;";1991;8.0;0.0
690;Singapore;"&quot;Singapore&quot; is a two-player wargame covering the Japanese invasion of British Malaya in World War 2.  The game is operational in scale, with units representing brigades and regiments.  The map sheet consists of two maps: a large-scale map of Malaya as well as a more detailed map of Singapore island.  The earlier turns of the game take place on the larger Malayan map, and the play moves to the smaller Singapore map only towards the end of the game, when the Japanese prepare to assault the island.&#10;&#10;Game components consist of one map sheet, 100 counters, rules, and game charts.&#10;&#10;The game was originally published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine (S&amp;T) #96.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:  &quot;Each hexagon on the large map of the Malacca Peninsular represents an area 16 miles across.

691;Timbuktu;"In this game each player takes the role of a caravan leader. The number of camels within a caravan depends on the number of players. Each camel is loaded with a lot of goods, and the goal of the game is to carry all the goods from the starting position to the final oasis: Timbuktu.&#10;&#10;However, during the course of this journey, the caravans stop at other oases. Once all camels arrive at an oasis, and night falls, thieves attack the caravan and steal different goods. While moving from one oasis to another, players receive different clues about the nature of the thefts. Each player has a different clue, and although clues are passed around, only one player receives three of the total five clues. From the actions of the other players (caravan leaders), the clues have to be guessed and camels have to be relocated, in order to save all the goods from the thieves.&#10;&#10;The next morning, the caravan continues its way towards Timbuktu, and players are challenged with different clues again.

696;The Big Idea;"The Big Idea is a quick and easy card game (Cheapass style) where the players represent venture capitalists creating companies (from a noun card and an adjective card - &quot;Erotic Pants&quot;) to take through the process of an IPO. You automatically gain a share in companies you create, and later you have opportunities to secretly invest in a company and publicly buy a share in a company. Finally, you roll a die to see which companies go public in a round: equal to or lessor than the shares issued in the company. And the pay out: based on the number of shares issued and the number of cards used in forming the company times the die roll.  The game is fairly simplistic, but it's lots of fun to create names of products like &quot;Mentholated Chicken&quot;, while agonizing over helping your opponent because their product will net you the biggest gain.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    The Big Idea: More Cards!

697;Conspiracy;"There are four capitals, four bankbooks, one top secret briefcase and eight greedy spies that anyone can control. The object is to move the briefcase to your headquarters. Players can either secretly pay off or openly move a spy one space on their turn. Each player has an account of $10,000 and can bribe spies in increments of at least $100. If you move a spy, another player may challenge the move. The two players then slowly reveal how much money they each have on the spy in question. If the challenger wins, the move is rescinded. If the defender wins, the move stays and the challenger loses his next turn. Players need to cooperate against whichever player is closest to victory. You can conspire openly to swipe the case or murder a spy and turn the tables on a player who is a mere one space away from winning. No dice, no cards, no luck involved. Learn to work together or games will end in a hurry.&#10;&#10;Amigo version (Casablanca) published 1991 supports 8 players.&#10;&#10;";1973;6.27031;1.913
698;Gother Than Thou;"A satire of the &quot;gothic&quot; lifestyle, in which players try to accumulate twenty &quot;Goth Points&quot; while giving their opponents cards that subtract Goth points. &quot;Infection Points,&quot; which limit hand size, and &quot;Money,&quot; which limits draws, also come into play along with Goth points, so most of the cards are a mixed bag.&#10;&#10;";2000;4.61659;1.1538
699;HeroQuest;"HeroQuest is Milton Bradley's approach to a Dungeons &amp; Dragons-style adventure game.  One player acts as game master, revealing the maze-like dungeon piecemeal as the players wander.  Up to four other players take on a character (wizard, elf, dwarf, or barbarian) and venture forth into dungeons on fantasy quests. This game was made in cooperation with Games Workshop Ltd. who designed the miniatures and helped in many of the production details including background world and art in the rule book and scenario book. The HeroQuest series consists of the main game and a number of expansions.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a grid representing the interior of a dungeon or castle, with walls segmenting the grid into rooms and corridors. One player assumes the role of the evil wizard character (Zargon/Morcar), and uses a map taken from the game's quest book to determine how the quest is to be played. The map details the placement of monsters, artifacts, and doors, as well as the overall quest the other players are embarking upon. During a Hero's turn, the player can move before or after performing one of the following actions: attack, cast a spell, search for traps and secret doors, search for treasure.&#10;&#10;The game ends when every player has either returned to the spiral staircase, exited by a door, or been killed by the evil wizard. If the objective of the quest has not been accomplished then the evil wizard character wins. Items collected during the quest may be kept for future quests. The quests usually form part of a longer story, especially the quests which are part of the expansion packs.&#10;&#10;Additional material, which is generally missed since it is not technically an expansion, was published in the HeroQuest: Adventure Design Kit which did feature one more Heroquest adventure: A Plague of Zombies.&#10;&#10;";1989;7.21269;2.1336

The higher the card played, the more likely one is to move up, but there are other interesting plays such as grappling onto another balloon, using soporific gas on lower balloons or storms which defeat the leaders. It can be especially interesting to compete against the non-player Black Baron who has been known to win the game from time to time, even playing randomly.&#10;&#10;";1992;5.85581;1.2319

739;Ultimate Soccer of America;"Described by the Publisher/Designer:&#10;&#10;Ultimate Soccer is a new and exciting soccer board game that allows you to be the player as well as the coach.  You play against each other alternating as an attacker and a defender.  The attacker can select either a Fate or an Action card from draw piles.  Action cards map out actual plays with 2-6 passes and a shot on goal.  Each Action card has a number on it 5v3 or 3v3.  These numbers tell you how many dice you will be rolling against each other for each pass.  The attacker is always the first number.  If the attacker rolls a higher number it completes the pass and you go on to the next pass, if the defender rolls a higher number than the attacker the pass was not complete and the action card gets discarded and now the defender draws a Fate or Action card and becomes the attacker.  If the attacker completes all of his passes and is now at the last line on the card this is the shot on goal.  For the shot on goal the attacker and the defender only roll one die a piece to simulate the shooter and the goalkeeper.&#10;&#10;Fate cards are things that can happen during a game like red card, injuries, goalkeeper saves.  Fate cards can be used at any time to help you in your game.  The game is complete when all the action cards have been used.

745;War of Resistance;"Box description:&#10;War of Resistance is a detailed, operational level game which chronicles the second Sino-Japanese Conflict starting on July 7, 1937. Often touted as the true beginning of World War II, this 8 year war is the culmination of a decade of aggressive Japanese policy in northern and central China. The game covers the conflict through Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.&#10;The Chinese theatre is neither trivial nor inconsequential to the progress and outcome of World War II on a global scale. Over one million soldiers on each side perished. It is estimated that another 7.5 million Chinese civilians died. Over 40 million Chinese were left homeless. The vast majority of Japanese ground combat and support soldiers were engaged in China, preventing their use against the western Allies in the Pacific. America's material dominance may have been the decisive factor contributing to the Japanese demise, but Japan was already doomed to failure in the Chinese quagmire. This is essential to the greater understanding of the war in the Pacific.&#10;Western nations tend to ignore and forget the Chinese contribution to the war effort. It is an indication of western arrogance that World War II is considered to have started on September 1, 1939 and not July 7, 1937. The Chinese war effort was far from stellar, but it was enormous. The immensity of the conflict sapped the Japanese war machine to exhaustion.&#10;War of Resistance is a two-player game, with one player representing the military high command of the Japanese forces and their puppet allies, and the other the fractured Chinese military forces. The Japanese player must force the collapse of the Chinese national will to resist. The Chinese player must cling to survival until the entry of the western nations into the Pacific war ensures ultimate victory over the Japanese invaders. Both sides maneuver their forces and conduct combat in an attempt to achieve these goals.&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;&#10;    One rules booklet.&#10;    Two Orders of Battle booklets. One for the Japanese and one for the Chinese orders of battle.&#10;    A Battle Scenarios Booklet&#10;    Four &quot;full-sized&quot; maps (Maps G1 thru G4) and 2 &quot;half&quot; maps (Maps G5 and G6).&#10;    Two map overlays&#10;    8 counter sheets (CS G1 - CS G7)&#10;    A set of charts &#10;    Two six-sided die&#10;&#10;&#10;";1998;7.03803;4.4615

755;Thunder at Cassino;"Thunder at Cassino is a mid-complexity wargame on the Third Battle of Monte Cassino during the Second World War. The game uses the area-impulse system first used in Storm over Arnhem, and to be used subsequently in Turning Point: Stalingrad and Breakout: Normandy.&#10;&#10;The game depicts the battle from 15 Mar 1944 to 23 Mar 1944. The Allied attackers consisted of elements of the 2nd New Zealand Corps, comprising the New Zealand 2nd Division, the Indian 4th Division and the British 78th Division.

759;Turning Point: Stalingrad;"Turning Point: Stalingrad is mid-complexity wargame on the battle of Stalingrad during World War 2. Attackers from the German 6th Army must dislodge the Russian 62nd Army and take the city of Stalingrad before the commencement of Operation Uranus. If the city could be taken, German troops could then be re-deployed to reinforce the Italian and Rumanian formations holding the flanks of along the Volga. The fiasco at Stalingrad can then be prevented.&#10;&#10;The game is an operational level treatment of the actual streetfighting. Each turn is a day comprising of a variable number of daylight and night impulses. Units are battalions and armoured units representing AFVs in platoon and company strength. The map is on a scale of 1 inch to 500 metres, depicting the city of Stalingrad and its western approaches, divided into 74 areas divided according to terrain features, and rated for defensive suitability. Victory is determined by the number of objectives captured by the German player each week. If it exceeds the requirements for the week, he wins. If not the Russian player wins.

761;The Great Brain Robbery;"Welcome to the Old West, Zombie style. The undead line cooks at Friedey's Chuck Wagon are fed up with having only one Brain to pass around. So they've decided to take matters into their own hands and rob a speeding train full of Brains. They'll bring home the best Brain they can find, and then pass that around instead. Hey, no-one said it was a good plan.&#10;&#10;This is the fourth game in the Friedey's series, and the first Cheapass board game to come in a sturdy cardboard box. The &quot;board&quot; is composed of eight double-sided Train Cars, and the Train grows and shrinks throughout the game. New cars appear in the front as players move forward, and old cars fall off the back, well, sort of randomly. To win the game, you need to find the Brain with the highest IQ before the Train comes to a stop, and defend it from all the other Zombies who'd rather beat you up than find a better Brain on their own. A splendid and imaginative adventure for 3-7 players, illustrated as always by lovable Zombie artist Brian Snoddy.&#10;&#10;";2000;5.54153;1.3
765;Space Walk;"A mancala-like game with victory points awarded to surviving space ships. The board consists of a loop of &quot;black holes&quot; each separated by 6 intermediate spaces. A move consists of picking up all the space ships of one space and sowing them in a mancala fashion around the board. Ships that fall into a &quot;black hole&quot; are lost forever. The game ends when one person has lost all ships.&#10;&#10;Several rules twists help make this more than a simple mancala knock off. For one, ships come in 3 sizes (victory points of 4, 3, and 1), and there is a requirement that the bigger ships are sown first. Second, each player has 3 chips that allow an extra move, but are worth 2 victory points if unused. The strategy comes in figuring out how to use your opponent's ships as sacrifices in getting your ships around the black holes.&#10;&#10;Awards&#10;&#10;1999 Vuoden Perhepeli&#10;&#10;";1999;5.97041;1.5217
767;Keywood;"from Game Cabinet Review:&#10;&#10;2 - 5 players attempt to settle and govern a new land of six villages. Each player may only introduce two new villagers per turn across five or six turns total. Villagers start as farmers earning a fixed income. Part of that income may be spent to purchase trade licenses which allow your villagers to set up as traders. Traders earn an income based on the population of their village. Each village must also elect a representative to government each turn. These councilors move to town and have no income for that turn (so much for realism - there is no provision for special interest groups or political action committees!). The government must decide whether to tax the farmers, tax the traders, or revoke one type of trade license. When this session of government breaks up councilors can either pay their own way home or pay a small fee and remain in government for another turn (well, at least that sounds realistic!). Each turn a new marketplace is opened which doubles the income of the host village. The villages bid fiercely for the right to host the new market each turn. Finally, the villagers and traders earn income and pay their taxes. The player that has the most money after the last round of play inherits control of the lands of Keywood and wins the game.&#10;&#10;Keywood is Richard Breese's first game in the key series.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.77667;2.0

771;Kings and Castles;"The last English King (as opposed to King of England) died in 1066. This game is about what happened next. The men who occupied the throne for the next 400 years were a particularly unpleasant bunch, whose main thought was of personal aggrandisement. Having deprived the English of the right of self-government, the more energetic of them set about trying to do a similar job on their neighbours. In Kings &amp; Castles the players take the part of these men as they pursue their ambitions at home and abroad. The treatment is broad-brush and fairly abstract: there is a map and the counters carry pictures of castles and soldiers, but you don't have to start worrying about dice and combat results; this is not a wargame.&#10;&#10;Players take turns to conquer as many regions as possible with their own and opponents forces - an intriguing mechanic - then decide whether to tax the hard working peasants or not. Plenty of decision making and room for tactics with a different player/king sequence every time you play.&#10;&#10;";2000;6.64133;2.6154

Equipment is a set of cards each showing one letter and a point value (there are also wild cards).&#10;&#10;You have a hand of up to 10 cards (you can draw as many as you like until you reach 10 - you start with 5). On your turn, you play a word to the table, with as many cards as you like face down. You announce the word, and everyone gets a chance to doubt you. You then show all the cards - if no one doubted you, you get the points for what you played (which could be QXZV, for a huge number of points). If someone did, you score if you were honest, with a bonus for each doubter. If you lied, the doubters get a bonus. You also get a bonus depending on your hand size and how many cards you played.&#10;&#10;";2000;5.98259;1.5714
785;Dog Eat Dog;"In this decidedly politically un-correct game, players control corporations which are plundering the environment  to produce assorted products, all for the sake of the almighty dollar.  Each of the companies produces a slightly different product, which is made by combining two different raw materials.  The raw materials come from various parts of the center of the board.  When a company harvests these materials, they can choose to either take one, which retains the environment's purity, or they can take multiples, which can turn the area into an ecological wasteland.  Players must balance a work force which is used to collect and process the raw materials, and they must then try to get the best price for the finished product in a randomly adjusted market.  Typically in games of this nature, the corporation who makes the most money is the winner, but in this morally corrupt environment, it's the CEO who makes the most money who's deemed the winner.  And the only way to make money is by embezzling from your company...&#10;&#10;";1999;5.19074;2.4545
787;Palermo;"This game is divided into two sub-games.  The first part has players laying out street/business tiles.  Each tile has one business on it and a colored chip corresponding to the player who placed it.  Once the board is filled, play moves to the next stage.  Each player has a pawn next to the fountain at the center of the board.  The object is to visit each of the businesses that you laid out in the first phase.  Each successive business you visit gives you more movement points, but the real goal of the game is to score the most points.  Points are scored by forgoing remaining movement when you arrive at your businesses.  In addition to a scoring pawn, players are each given a police token which can be used to hamper other players' movements.  Players who have completed their circuit wait at the fountain until all players have finished, but finishing quickly gives you a point bonus for each turn you wait.&#10;&#10;";1992;5.93537;1.9
789;Focus;"Focus (or Domination) is a Sid Sackson abstract strategy game in which players attempt to make moves and capture pieces in such a manner that their opponent(s) have no moves remaining.&#10;&#10;On a turn a player may move a piece or stack of pieces based on the number of pieces that comprise it as well as the number of pieces to be moved (e.g. 1-piece = 1 space, 3 piece stack = 3 spaces.)  When a stack grows over five pieces, pieces from the bottom of the stack are removed to bring the stack back down to five.  Pieces of a player's own color that are taken by that player are reserved to re-enter the game at a later time; pieces of the opponent's color are kept as captured.  Reserved pieces can be entered on a turn in any space on the board in place of making a move of pieces; strategic use of reserved pieces can make the game by utilizing them to capture stacks controlled by opponent(s).&#10;&#10;Sackson includes the game In his 1969 book, A Gamut of Games.  The book  makes a reference to the Whitman Publishing  Company production of 1965, along with reporting that the two-handed version was first described in the October 1963 issue of Scientific American Magazine.&#10;&#10;";1963;6.4874;2.3836
791;LÃ¶wendynastie;"from a session report:&#10;&#10;In essence it&rsquo;s a round-and-round trick game, combining Frank&rsquo;s Zoo with Hattrick. 4 suits valued 1-10. High beats low. Net (or joker) beats 10. A 1 (or joker) beats Net. And then we&rsquo;re back into the numbers and round we go again. The trick is won when everyone passes.&#10;&#10;7&rsquo;s, 8&rsquo;s and 9&rsquo;s each have a sex. When one is played, if a player can play the same rank but of an opposite sex, a second trick is formed a la Hattrick. It&rsquo;s a powerful play, because the round then ends the moment either trick gets back to whoever played a currently winning card, improving the odds of you winning a trick. And causing all sorts of calculations as to what the best play is.&#10;&#10;Winning a trick with a net, or someone playing their last card induces a new deal. If you have a crappy hand, let a net win, concede and get a new hand. Otherwise, kick-start it again with a 1.&#10;&#10;In the round that someone wins their tenth trick (you start with 1, so it&rsquo;s actually the ninth trick), the last player to win their tenth trick in that same round wins.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.85944;1.7
793;Yahtzee Deluxe Poker;"Last Chance is contract Yahtzee with side betting. Each player starts with a stake of chips. One of seven cards is overturned which shows a combination a player must roll on five dice. The tougher the combo, the more the cards are worth if won. Players bid on the chance to roll for the card. Those who don't win the bid can bet for or against the roller. If the roller makes the combo, he gets his bid back plus the card's stated value plus any bets made against him. If he fails, he loses his bid money. Any dice he applied to the combo stay on the card and players bid again on the partially completed card. If a player is low on cash, he can call &quot;last chance&quot; during bidding to win the bid automatically. Failure to make the combo will cost that bidder the game, however.

Over the years, the Hertzano family licensed it to other countries and Rummikub became Israel's best-selling export game.&#10;&#10;Hertzano's Official Rummikub Book, published in 1978, describes three different versions of the game: American, Sabra, and International. Modern Rummikub sets include only the Sabra version rules, with no mention of the others, and there are variations in the rules between publishers.&#10;&#10;In Turkey, the game is known as Okey and is widely played by families at gatherings or at local cafes.&#10;&#10;Like Rummy that you play with cards, you try to get rid of all your tiles by forming numbers into runs of 3 tiles or more, or 3 to 4 of a kind. The colors of the numbers on the tiles are like card suits. This game may start rather uneventfully, but when the players start putting more and more tiles in play, the options for your upcoming turns can become more complex, challenging, and exciting (from areyougame.com).&#10;&#10;";1977;6.49483;1.7152
813;Goosebumps: Terror in the Graveyard Game;"This is a game that is a favorite of the kids.&#10;&#10;This game must be assembled inside the game box. Once constructed, it presents a graveyard, with movement spaces, hedges that cannot be crossed, moving tombs, and a crypt containing a headless ghost. The ghost must be defeated in order to win.&#10;&#10;Each player has two character pawns--only one of which they may chose to move on each turn. They move as far as is permitted by the amount shown on their die roll. Also on each turn, the tomb die is rolled, and one of the tombs is moved. This tomb movement alters the playing field by changing what some of the spaces on the game board represent. In this way, a player might land on a square that is safe, but after a tomb is shifted--they suddenly find that they are left &quot;paralyzed with fear.&quot;&#10;&#10;There is complete freedom of movement, except as stated above, and players cannot cross their own path. One of the special spaces is a &quot;Goosebumps&quot; space. On this space, the player draws a Goosebumps card. Some cards require players to perform an action straight away, others allow players to play now or later. One card allows play at any time.&#10;&#10;During the game, players attempt to foil each other by picking up cards that allow them to turn other players into monsters, move other players onto bad spaces, steal each other's cards, etc. After a player has been turned into a monster, they can only be cured by landing on a &quot;magic potion&quot; square. If you are unfortunate, you can also fall into one of the open tombs--that character of yours is then stuck there until the end of the game. Characters can fall into tombs only by the movement of the tomb--In other words, they cannot be moved directly into a tomb.&#10;&#10;Once a player reaches the crypt, they may attempt to defeat the headless ghost. In order to do so, they first must have picked up a ring card. At the crypt, the player drops the skull down the chute--if it falls the right way, then the headless ghosts springs into the air and the player wins. If not, they can attempt to defeat the ghost on their next turn.&#10;&#10;";1995;5.54372;1.2143
814;Aquarius;"The groovy card game that's kind of like dominoes (only better!) Aquarius features three types of cards: Elements, Goals, and Actions. Element cards are played kind of like dominoes, with each player trying to win by connecting seven panels of one particular element. Goal cards determine which element each player is going after, and Action cards allow players to shake up the action in five different ways. The game is fast, fun, colorful, and easy to learn.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.07231;1.1346
815;Chrononauts;"In Chrononauts, each player becomes a time traveler, with a unique identity and a secret mission. During the game, players travel backwards and forwards through history, doing all those things people have always dreamed of using a time machine to do: Visiting the great moments of the past, peeking into the future, collecting up impossible artifacts and priceless works of art (at the moment just before history records their destruction), coming to grips with the paradoxes of time travel, and of course, changing pivotal events and altering the course of history itself. How would the timeline be different if Lincoln and JFK had not been assassinated? And is that the version of reality that you came from originally...the one you must return to in order to win? It's all packed into a fast and easy Fluxx-style card game that will take you to the beginning of time and back again.&#10;&#10;";2000;6.18783;1.8512
816;2038: Tycoons of the Asteroid Belt;"2038 is a space mining adaptation of the 18xx series of games.  First, you have the ever important stock trading rounds followed by operating rounds where you try to deliver commodities mined from the asteroid belt.&#10;&#10;Instead of laying track, the players explore the asteroid belt and lay claims to various mining resources. During operation rounds, ships move from mine to mine limited only by their fuel and the players' refueling stations. Operation is thus more flexible than in most 18xx games, and the randomly generated map greatly increases replay value.&#10;&#10;";1995;7.10435;4.0196
819;Quacksalbe;"from Game Cabinet Review&#10;&#10;Each player is a doctor practicing a specific type of medicine - acupuncture, drugs, blood letting, electric shocks - all the very latest techniques, all neatly color coded. Your hand of numbered cards may have some of your own color, and certainly some of other players' colors, and both low and high cards are useful as we shall see. In the manner of Carry On Doctor, the hapless victim patient is wheeled in before the arrayed quacks. Every patient is different, but your aim is to cure him (by having the largest combined total of cards in your color) without killing him (ditto, but exceeding the patient's specified limit). Your typical private patient is pretty weedy, so expires on a total higher than 14. You might play your own 8 card hoping to get close to the total, but your rivals will be only too pleased to play a 5 and a 3 to kill him off. The body goes into your mortuary (minus points) hopefully to be offset by cured patients (positive points). And that is it.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.38889;2.5
820;Axiom;"Axiom is a two player strategy game that is played in three dimensions.  The board is made up of twelve cubes, six of each color. Each player has two pawns which snap into the indentations on the cubes.  The object is to capture one of the other player's pawns.  On a turn, a player can move one of their pawns over the surfaces of the cubes, or move one of their cubes to change the playing surface.&#10;&#10;At Essen 2008, a new version was released with a new physical design: smooth curved pawns, held into the indentations by magnets.&#10;&#10;";1988;6.94534;2.875
821;La Trel;"A unique blend of elements from Chess and Checkers, an abstract game for two players using the pieces: Defenders, Sabers, Tridents, and Warriors.  While Warriors can move in any direction (like the Queen in Chess), Sabers may only move cardinally (as rooks) and Tridents may only move diagonally (as bishops).  Defenders, as the name implies, cannot capture but are used to block or confound one's opponent.  Pieces are captured in a Checkers-like fashion of being jumped over, with special rules for corner captures, and piece substitution.  An unusual game combining very well-known mechanics from two of the classics.&#10;&#10;";1994;5.61804;1.6
822;Carcassonne;"Carcassonne is a tile placement game in which the players draw and place a tile with a piece of southern French landscape represented on it. The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, et cetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of their meeples in one of the areas on it: in the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, in the cloister as a monk, or in the field as a farmer. When that area is complete that meeple scores points for its owner.&#10;&#10;During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&quot; or &quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, thus making it a harder for them to complete it and score points?&quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.&#10;&#10;First game in the Carcassonne series.&#10;&#10;";2000;7.41271;1.8887
823;The Lord of the Rings;"The Lord of the Rings is a co-operative game in which the object is to destroy the Ring while surviving the corrupting influence of Sauron. Each player plays one of the Hobbits in the fellowship, each of which has a unique power.&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, you make your way across four conflict game boards, representing some of the most memorable conflicts from the entire trilogy: Moria, Helm's Deep, Shelob's Lair, and Mordor. Each conflict board tests your small Fellowship to the utmost as you must play your quest cards to advance along multiple tracks. These tracks represent fighting, hiding, traveling, and friendship, and by playing quest cards from your hand with matching symbols, you can keep moving forward and push closer to victory.&#10;&#10;The master game board indicates both the physical progress of the fellowship across Middle Earth and the corrupting influence of Sauron on the hobbits. If you're able to slip past your foes, you can hope to escape with minimal corruption, healing your hurts at safe havens along your path, such as the forest kingdom of Lothl&oacute;rien. By playing your cards right and advancing quickly, you can collect powerful runes, unlock legendary cards to aid your journey, or find life tokens to help stave off corruption &mdash; not to mention advancing quickly through the conflicts. As you travel, the One Ring can be a crucial tool in your journey, allowing you to hide from sight, but repeated use will draw the attention of Sauron and corrupt the heart of the Ring-bearer.&#10;&#10;Your journey leads you deeper into the darkness with each passing conflict, and safe havens become few and far between. You must carefully watch the corruption track because if the Sauron miniature ever meets a Hobbit, that player is eliminated &mdash; and if the Ring-bearer is eliminated, all players lose as Sauron reclaims the power of the One Ring. To win, throw the One Ring into the volcanic fires of Mount Doom.&#10;&#10;This game should not be confused with Reiner Knizia's children's game (Lord of the Rings) with the same title, or with his very different two-player Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation.&#10;&#10;Lord of the Rings - Limited Edition&#10;&#10;A special edition limited to 500 copies in the English language and 250 in German published by Sophisticated Games and Kosmos in November 2001.

825;Screaming Eagles;"Screaming Eagles is a jet fighter dogfight with a unique board that allows for some bizarre moves. Players control 1 or 2 fighters and try to shoot each other out of the sky. Movement direction is determined by card play, and movement distance is determined by die roll. When your fighter moves off the front edge of the board, it &quot;loops&quot; to the back of the board and continues. If you successfully position your jet behind an enemy, open fire with you cannon or a missile.  Damage is assessed by a die roll, and multiple hits are needed to bring down a plane unless a(n un)lucky shot strikes the cockpit or fuel tank. This is simple game that plays at jet speed!&#10;&#10;";1987;6.07448;1.3448
826;Cartagena;"Cartagena takes as its theme the famous 1672 pirate-led jailbreak from the fortress of Cartagena. Each player has a group of six pirates, and you want to be the first to have all six escape through the tortuous underground passage that connects the fortress to the port, where a sloop is waiting for them.&#10;&#10;To move a pirate, you need to play a card from your hand. Each card bears one of six symbols (dagger, pirate hat, etc.), and when you play a card, you move one of your pirates forward to the next matching symbol in the tunnel, leapfrogging over matching symbols where another pirate already stands. The only way to get more cards, however, is to move backwards; more specifically, you move one of your pirates backwards to the first space that holds one or two pirates, drawing one or two cards after doing so. Each turn, you take 1-3 actions, whether moving forward or backward or both.&#10;&#10;When you move a pirate to the end of the track, it jumps on the sloop where it must await the other pirates in its crew. With every step toward victory, though, you have fewer and fewer pirates to move each turn, possibly locking you in to actions you don't want, so be sure to plan ahead and not leave yourself empty-handed!&#10;&#10;";2000;6.68085;1.5987
827;Attila;"In 375 A.D., Attila's mounted Huns overran Europe causing the Germanic tribes in their path to flee and penetrate the outer provinces of the declining Roman empire. In Attila, the players influence the migrations of the Germanic tribes to the Roman empire. The winner is the player who has exerted the best influence on the most successful of the tribes.&#10;&#10;Players have a hand of cards which correspond to the invading tribes. A turn consists firstly of playing a card and placing the matching tribal marker onto an area of the board, expanding from their start areas, then secondly either repeating this or increasing their influence in that tribe. If a province now contains 5 tribal markers in total, war breaks out between the tribes. The basic strength of each tribe is the number of markers there, but each player can add matching cards from their hand to boost this. The weakest tribe is eliminated (or rather, all tribes with the lowest total), leaving the province at peace and with no possibility of further tribal markers being added. Scoring occurs four times during the game at the end of each century; the first century ends after one war, the second after a further two and so on. The player with the most influence in each tribe scores 1 point for each tribe marker, the player in second place scores one point per area the tribe is in (thus if there is only one tribal marker of one sort in each area both 1st and 2nd will score the same). The influence a player gains increases in each century, so large swings in control are possible.&#10;&#10;Players are thus aiming to expand tribes in which they have the most influence (and conversely, are gaining influence in the tribes they expand) whilst at the same time trying to manipulate the timing and provinces where wars happen with a view to protecting their own favoured tribes and eliminating others. Gameplay is therefore not just about playing out as many of 'your' tribes as you can as you will need matching cards to defend with, and in any case may simply not have the right cards in hand. And sometimes you will want to provoke a conflict, for example by adding a tribe you don't have much influence in to finish an area where one of your favoured tribes is strong.&#10;&#10;";2000;6.46311;2.5533
828;Wizards;"This is Avalon Hill's game of Fantasy Adventure.&#10;&#10;This game uses hexagonal modular map sections, providing a different board layout for each game.&#10;&#10;Map tile-sections are placed on a blank mapboard to make up the arrangement of the Enchanted Islands for that game.&#10;&#10;Most of the game consists of performing various mini-quests by moving around the 18 islands to pick up marker counters for the specific quest.&#10;&#10;Each quest adds to the 10 quest per fortnight (14 days) requirement. Failure to reach this total of quests among all players causes one of the 18 islands to be flipped over and taken out of the game.&#10;&#10;In this way the players are competing mainly versus the game system.&#10;&#10;Endgame consists of players racing against each other to be first to collect 6 Gem Fragments and take them to the High Druid.&#10;&#10;";1982;6.39727;2.9615
829;Battle of the Bands;"Players race to get a set number of &quot;Superstar Points&quot;, through paid gigs and hit singles, using the familiar &quot;draw-one play-one&quot; method. You build your band using member cards, and equip them with instrument cards and reputation cards. When a &quot;gig&quot; card comes up, the players all roll 1d6, then add in the bonuses from their band members, the highest roller getting the gig. &quot;Contract&quot; cards allow you to start playing &quot;Hit Singles&quot; on yourself (for more &quot;Superstar Points&quot;), and other cards affect your band and gameplay in various different ways.&#10;&#10;";2001;5.80326;1.4348

Whether the stories are FIBS . . . or NOT, is all up to you.

Either your real story is so outrageous that it sounds like a fib, or your fib is so believable that it sounds real.

831;Schrille Stille;"Players are the heads of 1 of 6 fictitious music companies, trying to predict/influence the popularity of 14 different musical acts. Each turn, players get 7 chits with +/- values on them, 5 of which they may use to secretly vote for the bands they want to support. Players are awarded points at the end of a round if one of their bands is in the top 6 slots. Players also have 2 special chits that either award extra points if played on a band that jumps to #1, or add/deduct points based on how far up (or down) a band moves from its original position. Some bands in the last 4 slots are removed at the end of a round depending on their original board position, and the top 3 are removed (one-hit wonders) once a player's score reaches the 30 and 50 point mark. The game ends once a player reaches 70 points total. Very nice artwork and goofy band names (as only the Germans can do it) are complemented by one of the cooler game components ever; a wooden &quot;CD Player&quot; that the DJ (dealer) uses to tally up the votes.&#10;&#10;Please be aware that, although this was formerly listed as a family game, a few of the band names contain adult language.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     BrettspielWelt (real-time)&#10;&#10;&#10;";1999;6.44923;1.7531

The playing area is much larger than say Hannibal, there are lots more forces and generals, and there is a much more complicated political control/strategic will system - as well as quite a few other significant elements. While still clean and streamlined for a complicated wargame, this is nontheless more of a serious hobby game than any of the previous entries in the genre.&#10;&#10;&#10;(Note from Mark Herman:)&#10;&#10;The game was reprinted and the latest and final version of the rules has incorporated all of the previous FAQs plus has re-written some of the more troublesome rules sections (rivers). To date, after a grueling three-year on-line tournament, no rules questions of note have been forthcoming. The above write up is mistaken when it states that &quot;For The People&quot; is based on &quot;Hannibal vs Rome&quot;, but was my second game in the &quot;We The People&quot; genre that I created. The game dropped my battle card system in lieu of a more traditional combat results table to speed play and increase historical accuracy.&#10;&#10;UPDATE:&#10;The 2006 edition, component description above, was recently released. Other than the use of color in the rules and the play aids, the only difference between this and the 2006 edition is I added some variant rules to the rulebook.

More specifically, during the game each player builds a timeline of cards, with each card listing an historical event and the year in which it occurred.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, players are dealt two cards, which are then placed face up in chronological order. On their turn, a player is read an event from a new card; the player must then indicate the position on their own timeline where the card should be placed. If they're correct, they take possession of the card and inserts it in their line; if not, the next player gets a crack at it, and so on. The first player with ten cards wins.&#10;&#10;Some versions of Chronology have players compete to create a timeline of only five cards.&#10;&#10;";1996;6.51571;1.3973

You're one of 6 parties:  Independent,  Nationalist,  Conservative,  Socialist,  Labour,  Liberal.&#10;&#10;As you move from area to area fighting for votes,  you challenge other players parties.  Can you,  for instance,  counteract the Socialist' appeal to workers in the North East?

840;Corsairs;"Corsairs is essentially a card game where players attempt to assemble the correct combination of provisions in order to be able to board galleys, whilst possessing a strong enough crew in order to board the ship and fend off their opponents potential counterattacks. The game comes with 30 galleys tiles in five different colors. Four of these galleys are placed face-up on the table and are ripe for the taking. Each galley indicates the combination of provisions which must be played before a player can attempt to board it. In addition, each galley indicates the victory points it is worth, as well as the 'boarding' strength, which must be met or exceeded for it to fall prey to the pirates.&#10;&#10;Players are each dealt an initial hand of six cards, most of which depict one of six different types of provisions (water, bread, meat, rum, bananas or beans). In addition, several cards depict corsairs (pirates) with values ranging from 2 - 4.&#10;&#10;On their turn, players must play 3 cards. They may play them:&#10;&#10;a) beside a galley to begin amassing provision cards so as to eventually match the provision requirements indicated on the galley. &#10;b) to the discard pile, replacing them with cards chosen from rummaging through the discard pile&#10;c) 'fire a broadside' by playing any card to the discard pile and rolling dice. He may then steal matching provisions placed by the galley by other players.&#10;&#10;Once a player assembles all of the necessary provisions, he can attempt to board the ship. He needs to have enough corsairs, to add to the roll of two dice to beat the boarding value of the galley. Other players may also attempt to board the galley at the same time, and the one with the highest boarding value wins it. The others lose all the cards played next to the galley. A new galley is then made available.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player with most VP from galleys boarded.&#10;&#10;(precis from the review by gschloesser)&#10;&#10;";2000;6.05788;1.6667
841;Razzia;"There are six different (but equal) gambling joints where bits representing money are distributed at the beginning of each round. The object of the game is to finish with the most money. Players simultaneously choose a card from their hands to play. Each card corresponds to one of the six gambling joints and depicts either a gambler or a cop. The cards are revealed, and in each gambling joint where a gambler has been played, the money will be awarded, &agrave; la Hoity Toity/Adel Verplichtet, to the gambler unless a cop has also been played in the joint, in which case the cop gets it; if a cop  shows up but no gambler, the money stays where it is for the next round. When two gamblers or two cops both claim the money in the same joint, a negotiation mechanism which may involve the roll of a die comes into play. You have to do well in the simultaneity sweeps to get into contention at all, but doing well in the negotiation can make the difference between coming in first or second.&#10;&#10;The game comes in a small package about the size of a videotape and is attractively decorated in a sort of mid-1970s Gil Kane/Joe Giella DC Comics style.&#10;&#10;";1992;6.37419;1.3333

This newer version has considerably fewer rules and variability to navigate, but this simplification isn't a bad thing.  Players are charged with racing around the ancient Roman Coliseum in a desperate bid for the finish line.  Players use a small allotment of gold coins at the beginning of the game to select combinations of weapons, chariots, or drivers.  Once the race starts, players use whips to urge their teams, or savage the other players or other players' teams.

Cards represent your various relatives (Petulant Brats, Eccentric Widows, Bumbling Gardeners, Clever Nephews, etc.), the horrible accidents that befall them (Lost in the Hedge Maze, Fallen Down the Well, Mildly Suspicious Suicide, etc.), various graves, and &quot;incidents&quot; which have various affects, like causing an heir from an opponent's party to go &quot;On Holiday&quot; before (s)he could be done in, or causing an opponent's dead relatives to be &quot;Misplaced&quot;, and thus negating their value.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://studiohunty.com/sg/mausoleum/info.html&#10;&#10;";2000;4.6117;1.3636

848;Tip Tap;"In TohuWabohu, a.k.a. Tip Tap, players must race to finger the right items on the table &mdash; but winning an item isn't good enough as you need to protect it from being stolen while still hunting for more.&#10;&#10;In more detail, you set up the game by placing all of the multi-colored and strangely shaped cardboard bits on the table. Each round, one player is the director and takes charge of flipping over a card that depicts one or more of these bits. Everyone races to place a finger on the depicted items first, and once you've placed a finger on an item, you can't move it again. Once all the depicted items are found (assuming they were correctly figured), the fingerers place those items in front of themselves, then the director flips another card. If a card shows an item previously claimed, the owner of that item must secure it with a finger; if they don't, any opponent who touches it first will steal it away.&#10;&#10;If a player has seven or eight bits in front of them, then the round ends and everyone scores one point for each item that they collected. After playing as many rounds as the number of players, the game ends and whoever has scored the most points wins.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.79228;1.0
849;Golf Masters;"Golf Masters is part of the line of physical dexterity games published by Goldsieber published under the DSF imprint (see also: Tennis Masters).&#10;&#10;The game is played like real golf over a series of 18 holes with a target number for par. Each hole is constructed from some combination of the six modular boards or a subset thereof. A recommended tournament course is provided. There are special rules for each of the course hazards, including trees, sand traps, and ponds.&#10;&#10;Included in each game are two golfers of molded plastic and a metal club that extends through the body to a crank.

852;Pop Belly;"2-4 players feed the pigs... trying not to cause them to have Fette Bauche (full bellies). Unfortunately, when the pigs are full, they explode. (This is not considered good pig farming technique.) The player who &quot;popped the pig&quot; receives no points, while the other players get points equal to the number of chips they had in the pig. Memory plays a major part in this game,  as does wise dispersal of your chips.&#10;&#10;WHAT THEY'LL LEARN: Counting, Fine Motor Skills, Eye-Hand Coordination&#10;&#10;";1999;5.15542;1.25
853;...und tschÃ¼ss!;"...und Tsch&uuml;ss! means &quot;So Long!&quot; and is a simple card game where players compete for successive scoring cards on the table by laying cards with the lowest total. The trick is, there is one scoring card fewer than the number of players, so someone always goes empty handed. A bit like musical chairs.&#10;&#10;The deck has blue cards numbered 1 to 15 and red cards numbered -5 and -10. According to the number of players, you're dealt a hand and then the scoring cards are laid out. So with 6 players, you get 9 cards and compete for 5 on the table. The scoring cards are sorted from lowest to highest and everybody chooses a card from their hand and shows it. The lowest value card wins the lowest scoring card (which could easily be a negative!). That player is out and the remaining players choose another card. Whoever has the lowest total takes the next lowest scoring card and is out, and so on , until there are 2 players left competing for the final scoring card. Again, you add a card to your total, and whoever now has the HIGHEST total wins the last scoring card. Which means that if you can't go for the prize, you try to duck out earlier. Get it wrong and you've no chance of getting points. Play twice through the deck and the highest points scored wins.&#10;&#10;Part of the Goldsieber &#195;&#160; la Carte line of games.&#10;&#10;";1997;6.37863;1.2903
854;Doge;"Three or four players try to gain the most influence by building palazzos in Venice. Influence is placed face-down into city sections. When all is placed, they are revealed in a predetermined order. Having the most influence in a section allows a player to build the most houses and also give control over the adviser for that section. The adviser can be placed somewhere else in the city and adds influence in a later vote. Houses can be traded for Palazzos, and the player with 6, 7 or 8 Palazzos in 6, 5 or 4 city sections is the winner.&#10;&#10;Part of the Goldsieber large box series&#10;&#10;";2000;6.52131;2.5467
855;Java;"Java is a fascinating island with great potential for development &mdash; especially the undeveloped area of central Java with its fertile soil and rich natural resources. These riches are much desired by the rulers of the regions that surround central Java. Each player, as one of the Javanese rulers, tries to develop the region for themselves. Each wants to bring their culture and control to these undeveloped areas. The players irrigate the land and cultivate new rice fields; they build villages and palaces, and create cities from the villages.&#10;&#10;Each player desires to be the dominant force in the development of this new area. Players earn fame points for building and enlarging palaces, for creating irrigation systems, and for arranging palace festivals. The player with the most fame points after the final scoring wins.&#10;&#10;Java is the second game of the Mask Trilogy.&#10;&#10;";2000;7.00661;3.3799
856;New York, New York;"A tile-laying game of sorts, though it could be seen as a card game, it&rsquo;s just that the &ldquo;cards&rdquo; are narrow, tall, and almost impossible to shuffle as they&rsquo;re backed by heavy card.  The object of the game is to build up the New York skyline, consisting of twelve numbered sections.    Each section has four pieces, one in each colour - 48 tiles in all.   Each player has a colour for which they will score.   You start with a hand of six tiles, a &ldquo;draw pool&rdquo; of six face-up, and the rest face-down.   On your turn; you lay a tile, you replace from the draw pool, you replenish the draw pool.   The game continues until all the tiles are laid; though you can stop laying tiles if you want (to &ldquo;protect&rdquo; some of your own colours on show), but once you&rsquo;ve stopped, that&rsquo;s it, and other players can still lay theirs.   At the end, you score for any face-up tile of your colour, with bonuses for getting tiles adjacent.&#10;&#10;";1989;5.82528;1.2857

858;Blindes Huhn;"A simple trick-taking game where you are trying to avoid collecting the Blind Hens. The cards are numbered 0-59 and are all dealt out (use a reduced deck with fewer players). Players then take time to sort out their hand as they want to play it. When everybody has fixed their hand, the first trick is lead. You may only play a card from either END of your hand, you may NOT re-order your hand or choose from the middle. Score the tricks you won. Each card with a Blind Hen has some eggs on it, the eggs count against you - minus one point each. But if a trick has more than one Blind Hen in it, you total the Hens and multiply with the total eggs to give the score for that trick.&#10;&#10;";1997;5.31882;1.125
859;Illuminati;"Illuminati is a classic Steve Jackson (I) game of world domination. Each player takes on the role of a secret society attempting to spread its tendrils into special interest groups throughout the world.&#10;&#10;The game consists of three different cards (illuminati cards, group cards, and special event cards) and money. During a player's turn, a new card is drawn from a deck containing both group cards and special event cards. If it is a special event, the player in turn keeps the card and plays it when desired. If it is a group card, it is turned up along with any other face-up cards. The player in turn may then attempt to take over any group. This can be either a group on the table or a group already controlled by another player. If another player already controls the group it is more difficult to take it over, but not impossible.&#10;&#10;How difficult it is to take over a group depends on the strength of the controlling group, the resistance of the group being taken over, the proximity of the group being taken over to the controlling player's illuminati card (if someone already controls it), and other factors. Once this is determined, both the attacking and defending player can modify the odds further by spending &quot;megabucks&quot;. Once a group is taken over, it has to be attached to the card structure the player already controls. How cards can be attached to each other is limited by in- and outbound arrows on the cards, and maintaining a well-structured tree of groups can be vital to success.&#10;&#10;The winning condition for each player is different and depends on what illuminati card that player has.&#10;&#10;This first edition contains 54 small black and white cards.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Illuminati Expansion Set 1&#10;    Illuminati Expansion Set 2&#10;    Illuminati Expansion Set 3&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-published as:&#10;&#10;    Illuminati&#10;&#10;&#10;CCG Version:&#10;&#10;    Illuminati: New World Order&#10;&#10;&#10;Magazine Articles:&#10;&#10;    Imagine (Issue 6 - Sep 1983)&#10;        European Illuminati - New cards.&#10;    &#10;    The Space Gamer (Issue 59 - Jan 1983)&#10;        Illuminating the Post Office - Converting six groups to Illuminati.&#10;    &#10;    Space Gamer (Issue 72 - Jan 1985)&#10;        Death to Deadheads! - Variant rules for Illuminati, The Evil Geniuses Are Here! - Variant new cards for Illuminati, More Groups Illuminated! - A couple more illuminated groups for Illuminati, The Monty Python Illuminati - The British Illuminati, 24 groups, and 3 special cards with a Monty Python theme.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;";1982;6.17677;2.4842
860;Scotland the Brave;"from Consimworld:&#10;&#10;The Situation&#10;There is no greater hero in Scottish history than William Wallace. In 1297 he began what grew into the Scottish Rebellion. The death of his wife at the hands of the English launched Wallace on a quest to expel them from Scotland. Unlike other leaders in the rebellion, Wallace never betrayed his country, his comrades or his cause.&#10;&#10;The Game&#10;SCOTLAND THE BRAVE is based on the opening of the Scottish War for Independence. Beginning with the revolt of a minor land owner named William Wallace in 1297, it culminated in the victory of Robert the Bruce in 1315 at Bannockburn. SCOTLAND THE BRAVE simulates the first two years of the conflict in which William Wallace was the dominant figure. Players take the place of either William Wallace or King Edward of England as each attempts to gain the assistance of Scottish nobles and control of southern Scotland.&#10;&#10;SCOTLAND THE BRAVE originally appeared in issue no. 49 of Shadis Magazine. This Avalanche Press Edition features different components, complete with mounted mapsheet, and new rules. This is a fast-playing game which can be learned and played in a single sitting. Battle is a means to an end, with control of the towns the key to winning. Introducing randomness in the form of Strategy Markers adds a bit of spice. The game system is loosely modeled on the HOUSE DIVIDED game system&#10;&#10;";1998;5.91167;2.3077
861;Weapons & Warriors:  Castle Combat Set;"A simple action game.  Basically, you each have a base with 5 or 6 targets (some require multiple hits or hitting things in order).  You also have about 10 men.  You arrange a man on each target, and then place the rest on various grey dots on your base.&#10;&#10;You each have mechanisms to shoot little balls..catapults and crossbows and the like.  You take turns shooting 2-6 balls (depending on the die roll) at each other's targets.  You continue to take turns until you wipe out all of your enemy's targets.&#10; Connecting the two bases is a cardboard strip with trees and grey circles.  You can spend some of your shots to move a soldier towards your opponent on these circles.  You are allowed to place your shooting device closer to your opponent's base at this time...moving it up to be level with the advancing soldier.  However, advancing soldiers are quickly targeted.&#10;&#10;In play, the easy shots (soldiers and simple targets) get knocked out in the first few rounds.  The rest of the game is trying to make the tricky shots.&#10;&#10;";1993;6.05448;1.25

These trade routes will pass through the various economic regions of Morisi: farmland (yellow), pastures (orange), wineries (red), timberland (green) and fisheries (blue). Before trade routes can be built, the players must gain knowledge about these various region types by traveling through them with their pawn.

870;Empires of the Ancient World;"Going back to the age of Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar, you control the destiny of your empire--building armies, annexing neutral provinces, trading across the Mediterranean, and fighting battles. The heart of the game is its innovative card combat system. The full-color cards allow the use of pikes, swords, war bands, elephants, heavy cavalry, foot skirmishers, light horse, siege towers, artillery, and galleys. Special cards allow you to develop better military leaders, diplomats, traders, and engineers. However, winning the game is not just about having the largest empire. The player with the largest army will also lose the most victory points, so he had better use his forces well. If warfare is not to your taste then you can trade your way to victory, by having the largest trading empire.&#10;&#10;";2000;6.62511;2.9762

A timer is used to determine how much time one has to construct the required shape. Once you complete the required shape you turn the timer on its side. Others then have the remaining time to solve the puzzle or can work as a group to solve and get the points for solving.&#10;&#10;Shuffle the 36 task cards and 8 event cards together and placed them in the unsolved tasks area.  Each player takes a set of stones/playing pieces.  Players place their marker on the beginning of the scoring track.

875;Roads & Boats;"In Roads &amp; Boats, players start with a modest collection of donkeys, geese, boards, and stone. With these few materials, players work to develop their civilization. The emphasis in the game is logistical transport as you bring goods to producers to make new goods. But beware, the only thing you own is what is on your transporters, and anyone can use any production facility, or pick up any goods left behind.&#10;&#10;In more detail, this massive set of pieces looks more like a modular game kit than anything else. You get a several small hexes in a number of colors for terrain type; hundreds of little counters for the commodities that are produced and the locations where they're produced; wooden disks for all of the donkeys, rafts, trucks, and other forms of transportation you can use; and a roll of acrylic with an erasable marker. The tiles are laid out in whatever scenario you wish to play, and then the clear plastic is taped over the top to secure the entire board. Roads and bridges are drawn on the plastic and chits are placed in the hexes to form the playing surface. The idea is that your transportation units (at first, a fleet of 3 donkeys) travel about and pick items that part produced. However, the only thing that you own is that which is carried by your transports. So you might have a nice, shiny, new truck factory or a gold-filled mine, but anyone can use it or take it, if they collect the necessary components and can transport them to the factory. The ultimate goal is to collect wealth, which is progressively more valuable and harder to manufacture: gold, coins, or stock certificates; and also contribute to the game timer in the form of monument blocks for victory points.&#10;&#10;Third edition (and later) player transporter tokens were upgraded to shaped wooden tokens.&#10;For its 20th Anniversary, Roads &amp; Boats has an edition that contains the &amp;cetera expansion: Roads & Boats: 20th Anniversary Edition&#10;&#10;";1999;7.69486;4.1973
876;Tennis Masters;"Goldsieber attempts to capture the feel of tennis in this oddball dexterity game.  Each player has a  still tennis player figure which is used to volley the ball back and forth across the net.  Under each player, and under the translucent surface of the board is the movement paddle for that player, which dictates how far the playing figure could move for the subsequent turn.  The game field is set up just like a tennis court, with the requisite lines and a net, and the players volley a soft tufted &quot;tennis ball&quot;.  One player serves the ball, and if it lands within the fair territory, the receiving player checks to see if it fell within their movement paddle space.  That player then moves the center of their paddle under the ball and uses their figure to return the ball, and so on until one player scores by their opponent knocking the ball out of play, or by playing the ball in a space where their opponent cannot reach it within their movement zone.  All of the ball volleying is performed by tensing back the racket of the playing figure, and then releasing it to launch the ball across the net.  Scoring is handled just like regular tennis scoring.&#10;&#10;";2000;5.67553;1.5

884;Way Out West;"In this western themed game, players are looking to drive cattle across the west, establishing towns.  If you don't like the way something is going, you can fight other players for control with your cowboys.  You can rob the bank, rustle cattle, and shoot those pesky farmers!&#10;&#10;Gameplay:  To Start each player receives a set of colored player counters, matching turn order token, and two black action tokens and either $20 or $25 depending on number of players.  The dice are rolled to determine the start player. Each player in turn order will place one of their cowboy counters in a town box of any of the 5 towns on the map until each player has placed 3 cowboys.&#10;&#10;Each turn the players will bid for turn order, take actions and move the turn marker one space.  To bid for turn order each player places an amount of money under their turn order token in current player order.  Players may either raise or drop out.  If a player drops out all money bid so far is paid to the bank and their turn order token is placed in the furthest available spot from start player space on the turn order track.  This continues until one player remains and becomes the start player for the round.&#10;&#10;During the action phase each player will take 1 action in turn order.  After everyone has taken a turn they repeat the procedure.  The actions available are limited in number so turn order is important in doing what a player wishes to do.  Actions available are: Buy Cattle in a town containing their cowboy(s), Purchase more Cowboys, Move Cowboys to different towns, Move Cattle from one town to another, Purchase Buildings or Transport counters in a town, Take a Farmer(reduces income and victory points from Cattle in the town they are placed), or Gunfight.&#10;&#10;There are six different building and transport counters: StageCoach (these earn $1 per cowboy when cowboys are placed in or moved from the town containing the player's StageCoach), Train (this doubles the income gained from all players Cattle in the same town and doubles victory points gained from Cattle at game end),  Bank (earns its owner $2 for each building or transport counter in the same town), Store (earns the owner $1 for each Cattle counter belonging to other players in the town and $2 per Farmer counter in town),  Hotel (earns $1 for each cowboy belonging to other players in same town), Jail (the sheriff in the Jail acts as an extra cowboy controlled by owner that can be added to Gunfights). Cattle and Farmers also earn money for players during an income round.  Each Cattle counter earns its owner $2 UNLESS the town also contains a Farmer (it only earns $1 if this is the case).  Oh, the Farmer and Cowmen can't be friends.&#10;&#10;Gunfights can be started to take over another players Building or Tranport counter, rustle Cattle, rob a Bank or remove a Farmer or Jail.  The player choosing the Gunfight selects the target of the attack.  All Cowboys belonging to each player in the town will be involved.  The remaining player's Cowboys in the town are not involved. However; the owner of the Jail can choose to help themselves, if they are attacking, or they can add the Sheriff to the defender if wished.  Farmers that are attacked defend as a single cowboy.  Banks and Trains both have an intrinsic 1 Cowboy defense in addition to those in town of owner's color.  The player with the fewest Cowboys fires first and immediately removes casualties.  Each 5 or 6 rolled kills a Cowboy.  If the number of Cowboys is tied then firing is simultaneous.  A player may retreat instead of firing by moving each cowboy involved to a different town (only 1 per town) and loses the engagement.  If the attacker wins they take control of the target of the attack and may replace the counter (up to 2 counters if rustling Cattle) with one of their color (except for Banks, Farmers and Jails).  A Jail or Farmer is removed from play and a Bank is robbed.  The successful robber rolls 3 die 6 and takes that amount of money from the owner of the Bank (the Bank remains under owner's control).  If the owner of the Bank cannot pay the full amount (then pays all they have to the robber and the Bank is removed).  Each time a player wins a Gunfight they take a Wanted Counter.  If none remain they take it from another player their of choice.&#10;&#10;Victory:  After taking turns 3,6,9 and 12 income is paid to players as delineated above.  The game ends after round 12.  Victory points are awarded for each Building or Transport counter (1 point per size of town).  So a building in a Town with 4 Building or Transport Counters including itself is worth 4 points to the owning player.  Each Cattle Counter is worth one victory point for the owner.  If a train is in the town each Cattle Counter is worth 2 points.  If a Farmer is in the town Cattle are worth 1 victory point less.  To illustrate, if a Farmer is in same town Cattle counters are worthless unless a Train is also present in the town.  In this case, they would be worth 1 point each.  The player with the most Building/Transport counters and Cattle in a town is considered to control the town and scores bonus points equal to the size of the town (Cattle do not affect town size but do affect control).  The Player with most money gains 5 victory points (2 each in case of a tie).  The Player with the most Wanted counters scores 4 victory points.  The player with most Points wins.&#10;&#10;";2000;6.13047;2.6203

893;Smuggle;"According to the Designer/Publisher:&#10;&#10;SMUGGLE is a family action adventure board game that allows individual or team play.  The winner is the first player to complete a major, minor, and short treasure route.  Treasure Routes are diamonds, rubies, Inca Gold, Art Treasures, Mexican Silver, and money.  Play is accomplished on a dual-action board game, with movement of Jetliners on the peripheral Treasure Runway, which dictate the movement of Treasure Seekers and Treasure Couriers along the Treasure Routes on the world map in the center of the board. When a Seeker reaches a Destination Foreign City (New York to Johannesburg for Diamonds), a suitcase which is color coded to the Treasure Route (Orange for Major Routes, Gold for Minor Routes, and Grape for Short Routes) is attached to the base of the Seeker, which becomes a Treasure Courier.  The Courier then returns the Treasure (in the suitcase!) to the U.S. City of Embarkation.  When the Courier reaches the Customs 12 Mile Limit it can't move without declaring the treasure or making a smuggle attempt.  SMUGGLE cards are collected to facilitate the smuggle attempts.  Yin Yang Cards bring good fortune or bad fortune along the way. Each game has different dynamics.  Gals can square off against the guys and youngsters like to beat up on the adults!  There is interaction of players all along the Treasure Routes.  All players are in the game until it is over.  The play builds in excitement until the game-winning treasure is smuggled.  Smuggle Masters can team up against Treasure Czars for two teams of three players.  Three teams of two players include Border Jumpers, Port Runners, and Bootleggers.  Or it can be everybody for themselves. Everything is color coded for quick visual reference as to players and pieces.

904;Nightmare Productions;"Reiner Knizia's auction game about producing movies. In four rounds, players bid on chips representing genuine directors, actors, camera, effects, music, guest stars and agents (or in Nightmare Productions edition: creatures, locations, directors, musical conductors, cameos, and contractors). These all get placed on players' film-strips to complete the movie production. So one movie might need 2 actors (in editions prior to Nightmare Productions), but no music or effects and so on. As films are completed, the points value is marked and another film-strip taken. There are two parties (in Nightmare Productions edition: horror cons) each round where players get to pick from offers without paying anything. There are bonus points for first films completed and best films, best directors (in Nightmare Productions edition: best creatures), even worst film.&#10;&#10;The auction is a basic rising offer with passing until one winning bid remains. Players pay into the pot with contracts (in Nightmare Productions edition: money), and the rest of the players share the pot each turn. So it's a closed economy with players trying to time to bid on what they really need to complete films.&#10;&#10;See Movie Comparison - Traumfabrik for listings of movies and actors in each version prior to Nightmare Productions edition.&#10;&#10;Note: There have been many editions of the game under varying names.

Players spin to see where to start, and then the fun begins as the clue giver's team tries to guess each word combination.

911;Empires of the Middle Ages;"This classic SPI game from 1980 covers the economic and political landscape of Medieval Europe from 771 to 1467 on an area map.  Several scenarios allow players to do anything from a solitaire game during the Charlemagne's reign to the &quot;Grand Scenario&quot; that covers historical trends throughout the period.&#10;&#10;Decision Games published a second edition in 2004, with a differently styled map.  It added optional expansion rules &amp; counters for Armies, Fleets, and Civilization Markers, along with additional Event Cards -- raising their number from 56 to 164.&#10;&#10;At the start of each player's Round, Event Cards are drawn which change the strategic situation (such as Plague or Bounty) or benefit a player in various ways.  The descriptions of the Events contain a great deal of historical information, adding much interest to the game.&#10;&#10;Each player may attempt to perform up to five &quot;Endeavors&quot; per 25-year long Turn.&#10;&#10;There are six types of Endeavors:  Conquest, Pillage, Diplomacy, Defense, Fortification (including building Armies/Fleets) and Ruling. Additionally, moving Armies/Fleets and Taxation may always be performed.&#10;&#10;Endeavor resolution is diceless; instead &quot;Year Cards&quot; which show an array of results for each type of Endeavor are drawn.  The card might also require a Leader Stature Check, which can change the player's Combat, Administration, and Diplomacy ratings.&#10;&#10;Endeavor resolution is affected by the appropriate Leader rating, and the involved areas' language, religion, population, and Social State (which changes frequently).  Poor performance can lead to Unrest or Rebellion in an Area.&#10;&#10;An area's Social State value rises and falls as a result of Events and Endeavors, and improving the Social State of your empire is an important object of play.&#10;&#10;Optional rules add non-player Raiders and Magnates.&#10;&#10;The Sword And The Stars is a galactic empire game based on the Empires Of The Middle Age game system.&#10;&#10;";1980;7.173;3.5439

915;Mystery of the Abbey;"Mystery of the Abbey is a whodunit deduction game in the spirit of Clue. A monk has been murdered in a medieval French Abbey. Players maneuver their way through the Abbey examining clues and questioning each other to find out who is the culprit.&#10;&#10;Monks are of three orders, fat-thin, bald-hatted, bearded-clean shaven. One monk card is hidden, and the rest of the cards are distributed.  Turns consist of moving up to two spaces, and then asking a question of any other monks who are present there. (For instance, &quot;how many fat monks do you have?&quot;.) Players may either take a &quot;vow of silence&quot; or answer truthfully; they then in turn get to ask the accuser a question.  &quot;Mass&quot; occurs every four turns: all players go back to the Sanctuary, an event card is read, and they then pass an ever growing number of cards to their left neighbor. Various rooms have special events or cards associated with them, e.g. in a Cell you get to pick a card from a neighbor, in the Cryptorum you get to pick up a card to take an extra turn later. Unlike Clue you don't automatically win by making a correct Accusation: you get 4 points for getting it right, but you also get 2 points for each correct Declaration of a single trait, and lose points for incorrect declarations and accusations. So, e.g. a person could correctly Declare the culprit but lose the game.  Unique Events cards add randomness to each play, and the game begs for House rules to limit the questions.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.53665;2.2031

917;Rack-O;"The object is to score points. Each round, you replace cards in your rack so their numbers read in any numerical progression from a low number at the front to a high one at the back (the racks hold the cards behind each other); achieving this ends the round. The cards are numbered from 1 to 60; you initially place them in your rack in the order they're dealt. On your turn, you draw from the deck or the discard pile, swapping the card with one from your rack.&#10;&#10;The original publisher was Milton Bradley.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;Super Rack-O&#10;Racko Plus&#10;&#10;";1956;5.87931;1.1892

923;Breakaway Rider;"Simple card game of cycle racing. Players fight to hold the yellow jersey when the race ends.&#10;&#10;Players are dealt 6 cards and draw a 7th before playing a pace card, and any additional modifiers. There are 84 pace cards numbered between 39 and 50, Spurts (which add 2 to your pace), Headwind (which subtract -2 from your pace) and Mountains (which ensure that no one can take the lead from the current player).&#10;&#10;One player starts as the race leader with a yellow token, and plays a speed card. Successive players must match the leader's pace to stay in the Peleton (the race pack), and each enjoys a +2 to their pace card simulating the benefit of decreased wind resistance.  If a player falls more than 2 behind the pack, than they draw chips (representing minutes) equal to the difference from their card and the race pace.  If a player starts his turn not in the Peleton, than he does not get the +2 slipstream bonus.&#10;&#10;If a player plays a card that is faster than the race leader, they either take the lead, or make up time until they catch the Peleton.  If they take the lead, they take the yellow token, and successive players must now match their tempo.&#10;&#10;You must play Headwinds when you draw them, and you can use Spurts as you like.  You play Mountain cards on yourself or the race leader, and they prevent anyone from passing the leader, and they also remove the 2 km slipstream bonus that other player otherwise enjoy.&#10;&#10;The race ends when the deck runs out.  The player holding the yellow token wins and scores a point, the other players lose points equal to the chips in front of them.&#10;&#10;Timing is everything if you plan to win.&#10;&#10;";1963;6.17163;1.2745
925;Werewolf;"Werewolf (also known as Mafia) takes place in a small town where a minority of the townsfolk hold a dangerous secret.&#10;&#10;Each player is secretly assigned a role - Werewolf, Villager, or Seer (a special Villager). There is also a Moderator who controls the flow of the game.&#10;&#10;The game alternates between night and day phases. At night, the Werewolves secretly choose a Villager to kill. Also, the Seer (if still alive) asks whether another player is a Werewolf or not. During the day, the Villager who was killed is revealed and is out of the game. The remaining Villagers then vote on the player they suspect is a Werewolf. That player reveals his/her role and is out of the game.&#10;&#10;Werewolves win when there are an equal number of Villagers and Werewolves. Villagers win when they have killed all Werewolves. Werewolf is a social game that requires no equipment to play, and can accommodate almost any large group of players.&#10;&#10;";1986;6.45206;1.3861
926;CATAN: Cities & Knights;"Adds several new aspects to Settlers of Catan but the two major ones are creating knights to protect the land from invading barbarians and building city improvements that confer benefits upon that city's owner. Adds tactical complexity to the game and game length.&#10;&#10;Belongs to the Catan Series.&#10;&#10;The game changes the base game in three main ways:&#10;&#10;First, there are 3 new commodities in the game, distinct from resources - paper, cloth, and coins, which can be acquired from Forest, Meadow, and Mountain spaces, respectively. Cities that would normally produce two of one of those resources instead produce 1 resource and 1 of the corresponding commodity. (To make commodities easier to obtain, each player starts the game with 1 city and 1 settlement on the board.) These commodities allow players to build city improvements that confer various advantages and eventually points.&#10;&#10;Second, the deck of development cards is replaced by three different decks, each corresponding to one of the commodities. Building city improvements gives players a chance to draw these cards with every roll of the dice. Building more improvements will increase these chances, but cards cannot be bought directly in any way. These cards are similar to the development cards in the base game, but with a wider range of effects. (Some cards are balanced better as well - the new Resource Monopoly card, for example, can take no more than 2 of the named resource from any one player.)&#10;&#10;Finally, players can also build knights on the island along their network of roads. These knights can be used to claim certain intersections and move the Robber (taking the place of Soldier cards), but are also used to defend the island from periodic barbarian attacks. If the island is successfully defended, the player(s) with the most knights are rewarded. If not, the player(s) with the fewest knights each have a city downgraded to a settlement.&#10;&#10;";1998;7.44985;2.8949
927;Lift Off;"In Lift-off, players rush to allocate resources for planetary missions.  Each planet is contested by two players, either (or both) of whom can add cards representing, for example, settlers, energy modules, terraforming, or mining to their side.  A given planet may provide mineral resources and a number of settlement points -- the minerals can be collected for victory points, and if the planet is sufficiently terraformed, the settlement points go to whichever player sent the most settlers.&#10;&#10;";2000;5.08916;1.3571
929;The Great Dalmuti;"A light card game where players gain status by going out first.&#10;&#10;The 80-card commercial deck contains cards ranked from 12 to 1, along with two Jesters. Each card bears a number, which is not only its rank, but also tells you how many of that card exist in the deck. In other words, there are twelve 12s, eleven 11s, four 4s and a single card ranked 1. The lower the number, the better the rank.&#10;&#10;The deck is dealt out to all players and the object is to get rid of your cards as fast as possible. The hand begins with one person playing one or more card to the center of the table. The cards played must all be of the same rank (although Jesters are wild, and may be played with any other cards). Each player in turn must now either play the same number of cards of a better rank, or pass. Play continues around the table until everyone has passed; at that point, the cards are cleared and whoever played the last set of cards leads the next round. After everyone has gone out, the players are ranked. For example, the person who first got rid of all his cards becomes The Great Dalmuti. Players change seat position to represent the new hierarchy and begin another round.  The Great Dalmuti is generally played for many rounds.&#10;&#10;It is a commercial version of the traditional playing card game President (based on the Chinese game Zheng Shang Yu), which has also been reimagined as:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Dilbert: Corporate Shuffle&#10;    Pyramid Card &#10;    Scum: The Food Chain Game &#10;    Deathtrap Dungeon: Card Game&#10;&#10;&#10;";1995;6.59229;1.2857
931;Corner;"From the back of the box:&#10;&#10;Luck as well as strategy are important in this game. It starts out with the board filled with 36 coloured marbles in random distribution. Move by move players pick up marbles, trying to collect colours. Colour sets score higher!&#10;&#10;1. Each players has an arrow at the edge of the board, which he moves.&#10;&#10;2. The players take the marble which is at the intersection of the two arrows.&#10;&#10;3. This is the table of points: the higher the number of marbles in one colour, the higher the score!&#10;&#10;4. The board is easily prepared for each new round.&#10;&#10;Intersection, the original version, was played with 25 discs on a 5x5 grid.&#10;&#10;";1974;6.51365;1.4286
933;New Orleans Big Band;"Players compete to assemble a jazz band in the French quarter. But this singer won't work with that drummer, or that trumpet player won't play in a banjo band, or this saxophonist jumps in value with a clarinet player. Try to assemble the best band. After round 8, players may start trading. The starting player is the best singer. If there's an argument, have a sing-off!  Nominated for the SdJ in 1990.  The German text on the cards makes this difficult to enjoy for non-German speakers.&#10;&#10;";1990;5.82063;1.8

937;1825 Unit 1;"1825 is Francis Tresham's &quot;1829 revised&quot; 18xx game. It is released in 3 distinct modules, or units. 1825 Unit 1 and 1825 Unit 2 broadly cover the same area as the 1829 southern board. 1825 Unit 3 covers most of the remainder of England and Scotland, and with unit 2 will cover the same area as the 1829 northern board. Along with the units are a number of expansion kits, which introduce extra money, trains, tiles, companies, and phases. There are currently three, and will be four regional kits, which cover areas of England, Scotland and Wales not included in the three base units.&#10;&#10;The rules are largely 1829 with improvements. Survey parties are now optional, and track is built in much the same way as most other 18xx titles. The stock market is largely the same, but multiple leaps up the market are allowed if dividends are high enough. Trains can now run to, but not through tokened out stations, and company shares become available in &quot;bands&quot; of the same value. All shares in each band become available when one of the companies in the previous band is sold out.&#10;&#10;Play time varies enormously, depending on how much of the game you play. A single unit on its own will last 1 1/2 to 3 hours, and accommodate 2-4 or so players. Multiple units and expansions add to both the number of players and the playing time. Two units and all the expansions should accommodate 3-6 players (7 max. officially) and last for anything from 4 to 8 hours. All three units will work for 4-9 players, and a fair amount longer.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.8224;3.56
939;Star Wars: The Queen's Gambit;"Based on the four battles at the end of Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace -- the battle on the plain between the Gungan forces and the droid army; the attempt by Naboo forces, led by Queen Amidala, to storm the palace and capture the Trade Federation viceroys; the fight between Darth Maul and the two Jedi Knights; and the space battle in which Anakin's starfighter destroyed the Droid Control Ship.&#10;&#10;The forces are represented by 155 plastic miniatures on three separate boards, including a three-level palace.  The action is driven by two decks of cards for each side.  Each turn, each side simultaneously chooses four action cards from a hand of ten, and places them in order.  The actions are then carried out one at a time, alternating sides.  Combat is resolved using special attack and defense dice.&#10;&#10;";2000;7.58832;2.4848
941;Turbo Taxi;"Flickwerk is a neat little competitive puzzle game, similar in feel to Ricochet Robot. With multiple sets, even more players can participate in the same game.&#10;&#10;Each player has an identical set of 12 tiles displaying part of a network of computer cables. A further set is shuffled and placed face down in the centre of a 3x3 grid, representing the nine rooms through which the cabling will flow. Four markers are placed around the edge of the grid and these represent the only points at which the cabling can leave the grid. The top card of the centre pile is turned over and players have to re-arrange their own tiles in front of them to form a valid network, using the same centre tile as displayed and connecting up the four &ldquo;perimeter&rdquo; markers. First one to complete a valid network wins the centre tile (1 VP). He then rearranges the perimeter markers if he wishes and turns over the next card to be played for.&#10;&#10;The updated edition, Turbo Taxi, features city streets rather than computer cables. The markers on the edge of the grid are a yellow taxi, yellow house, black taxi and black house. Players must ensure that their tiles create valid routes leading the yellow taxi to the yellow house, and black taxi to the black house.&#10;&#10;This game can also be played solo as you try to complete a grid in the least amount of time.&#10;&#10;The contents of Turbo Taxi is:&#10;&#10;1 rulebook (the number may vary for multilanguage editions)&#10;1 city board&#10;&#10;60 cardboard tiles:&#10;&#10;     12 green player&#10;     12 yellow player&#10;     12 blue player&#10;     12 orange player&#10;     12 neutral (with a medal in its back)&#10;&#10;&#10;4 wooden pawns&#10;&#10;     2 black pawns&#10;     2 yellow pawns&#10;&#10;&#10;";2000;6.06397;1.4711
942;Snail's Pace;"A snail race championship including 6 circuits.  On each turn, the players play at the same time a speed card, then move.  An action card is then played trying to move farther forward, to shoot an opponent, or to push it on the wall...  Each snail starts the race with 3 shell points that will help it to survive the obstacles and opponent tricks.  At the end of each race,  snails score points depending on their ranking.  A fun light game for all!&#10;&#10;";2000;5.24242;1.0
943;Ligretto;"In Ligretto, each player has their own deck of forty cards, with cards 1-10 in four colors and a unique symbol on the back to identify which cards are theirs. At the start of each round, each player lays out 3-5 cards (depending on the number of players) face up in front of them to create their row; places a face-up stack of ten cards, seeing only the top card, next to their row to create their Ligretto stack; and holds the remaining cards in hand face down.&#10;&#10;Playing at the same time, each player tries to empty their Ligretto stack. If a player has a 1 card on top of any face-up stack, they play it to the center of the table. If they have a 2 card of the same color as any 1 in the center of the table, they can place the 2 card on the 1. All cards in the central piles must be played in ascending order and must be the same color.&#10;&#10;If a player can't play anything, they can reveal cards from the stack in their hand, counting them out in groups of three, then laying them face up while revealing only the top card. They can play this top card onto a central pile as long as the rules for doing so are met.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player empties their Ligretto stack, the round ends. Each player scores 1 point for each of their cards among the central piles, then loses 2 points for each card remaining in their Ligretto stack. In some versions of the game, the player with the highest score wins; in other versions, players then sort all the cards and play another round, with the first player to reach 99 points winning.&#10;&#10;A rules variant for Ligretto allows a player to play cards from their Ligretto stack or the cards in hand onto the cards in their row, but only if the numbers are in descending order and the colors of adjacent cards are not identical.&#10;&#10;";1988;6.19382;1.1693
944;MagÂ·Blast;"Mag-Blast is a space-themed card game in which each player tries to blast the other players from the universe. Each player assumes command of a race of beings whose powers are signified by the Flag Ship card at the center of their battle formation. The Flag Ship is surrounded on four sides with attack ships from the Ship Yard, up to 3 ships per side. On your turn you discard cards, draw back up to five, call for reinforcing ships (by playing combinations of 3 cards), and then play as many attack and defense cards as possible. Once you blast away an opponent's outer ship protection, you may attack his Flag Ship, hopefully destroying it, and eliminating it from the game.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Mag&#194;&#183;Blast (Second Edition)&#10;    Mag&#194;&#183;Blast: Third Edition&#10;&#10;&#10;";1998;5.94847;1.5789
945;Nametrain;"From the Designer/Publisher:&#10;&#10;Like most games the main objective is to try and be the first to finish, you do this by traveling around the game board (using names as your fuel), collecting one passenger from each of the following six categories, then taking them to the main central station to complete the Nametrain&trade;!&#10;&#10;Music.. &#10;Any group or Musician as long as they are known as the recording artist&#10;&#10;Television..&#10;Any TV program, but no using films shown on TV.&#10;&#10;Film..&#10;Any film whether it has been shown on the big screen, video or T.V.&#10;&#10;Sport.. &#10;Any sports person, male or female.&#10;&#10;Actor/Actress.. &#10;Any actor or actress from TV, stage or film&#10;&#10;Well Known People..&#10;A category for those that don't fall into any of the other categories.&#10;&#10;Playing the game&#10;To play Nametrain&trade; is very simple, somebody says a name from one of the six categories (listed above) and the last letter of that name is then used as the starting letter of the next. Each player then takes it in turn to roll the number dice and move their train along the allotted spaces, they must then give an answer from the category they land on using the last letter from the previous players answer as the starting letter of their answer...and so on.&#10;&#10;For example&#10;The game is in full flow and it's your turn, the player to your right has left you on an 'E' by saying Bruce leE (they were on the actor/actress square). You roll the dice, you move four spaces and land on the music square. You only have 60 seconds to say the name of a group or singer whose name begins with an 'E'.&#10;&#10;Who do you say...the sands of time are slipping away...if you don't say a name soon you will lose one of your passengers, there's only a few seconds left...what about Elvis presleY. It gets you out of trouble and leaves the next player on a 'Y', they could now be the one in trouble with you taking one of their passengers.&#10;&#10;";1993;4.92857;1.0

Pieces move in a straight line, including diagonally, as far as possible with no jumps. The three ways to win are arranging your pieces in a straight line on the board (not diagonally), occupying the four corners, or forming a 2x2 square anywhere on the board.

949;Twixt;"Twixt is a 2-player abstract game invented by Alex Randolph. TwixT is a &quot;connection-type&quot; game, very similar to Hex. Other related games are Havannah and The Game of Y. &quot;Connection type&quot; means the object is to form a path connecting something to something else. This requires very different thinking from the standard battle-type game such as chess or checkers.&#10;&#10;Some old US sets mention a 4-player variant, with 2 teams as in Bridge, but this probably wasn't Randolph's idea.  The game was popular in the 60s and 70s as part of the 3M Bookshelf Series. Avalon Hill then acquired the series and issued the game themselves. Several European publishers have sold the game as well.&#10;&#10;Twixt employs a pegboard, pegs and links.  The playing surface is a 24x24 square pegboard, usually minus the corner holes, with two opposite sides marked with one player's color and the other two sides marked with the other player's color.  Each player has a supply of pegs and links of their color.  50 of each piece type of each color, a total of 200, is an ample supply. Players alternate turns placing pegs and links, if possible, in attempt to have a continuous path of links connecting the two sides of the board with their color.&#10;&#10;After the 3M edition, Randolph added the pie rule. After the first peg is placed, the opponent has the option to swap sides. This reduces the imbalance from the first move advantage.&#10;&#10;On your turn you place one peg of your color on the board, and then add or rearrange your color links. Pegs may be placed in any vacant hole in the board except the corners and the last row on the sides of the opposing player. When two pegs of the same color are at opposite corners of a six hole rectangle (3x2 or 2x3), a link may be placed between those two pegs.  Links may not be placed such that they cross other links.  Multiple links may be added on a single move. Usually, all links are to the peg just placed, but on your move you are allowed to remove as many of your own links as you wish, and add your own links anywhere on the board as long as they are legal as described here.&#10;&#10;When a player connects his two sides with a continuous path of links, he prevents his opponent from doing the same, the game is over, and the player connecting his two sides wins the game. If neither side can complete such a path, the game is a draw.&#10;&#10;";1962;6.60099;2.49
950;Four Dragons;"From the designer Frank Branham: A 4 player partnership trick taking game themed around the Mexican Day of the Dead. (A particular favorite holiday of ours, as Sandi and I were married on that day in Marietta Confederate Cemetery.) It is short (about 30 minutes), and rather brain bending.&#10;&#10;Dia De Los Muertos (Day Of The Dead) is played over three days as you send animals, then children, then adults on to the afterlife. It is a basic trick taking game, except that most cards have an action with them. You play as a partnership, and if your side wins scoring cards (the dead or food), you exchange a card with your opponent. Other cards allow swaps between partners, asking a question, cancelling other cards and so on.&#10;&#10;The first time you play, there's a lot of checking the rules, checking the crib sheet, remembering if you exchange cards. You spend more time figuring the game than playing the tricks. But after a couple of hands, it makes sense and you switch to game-playing mode. And here's where it pays. If you enjoy Bridge, you can figure out what your partner signals when they swap a card, or you can read the deck based on what's been played, you will really enjoy Dia De Los Muertos. If you don't like Bridge, or can't figure trick-taking games anyway, steer well clear. It is rather brain-bending.&#10;&#10;The original game has nice native graphics of the dead abroad and has a variant for 3 players. The re-issue as Four Dragons has an oriental theme.&#10;&#10;Not to be confused with:&#10;&#10;     Dia de los Muertos (2007)&#10;     Dia de los Muertos (2016)&#10;&#10;&#10;";2000;6.56546;2.3556
951;Football Strategy;"Football Strategy boils the sport down to play calling skill. The game's structure is simple: The defensive player selects one of 10 formation cards (ranging from an 8-man line &quot;goal line stand&quot; to a pass prevent defense with five safeties); the offensive player calls a play (a choice of 20, plus punting). Cross-indexing the choices on a matrix shows what happened. Except for &quot;long gains&quot;, the outcome of each play against each defense is always the same. Dice are rolled only to determine the distance of long gains and the results of kickoffs and field goal attempts.&#10;&#10;Each play consumes a prescribed number of seconds, from 15 to 45. The players mark off the time and play four quarters, following the standard football rules.&#10;&#10;For variety, three types of offense (&quot;pro style&quot;, &quot;aerial game&quot; and &quot;ball control&quot;) are available, each with a different, though not radically different, results matrix.&#10;&#10;Simple though it is, the game is engrossing (see the &quot;More Information&quot; screen), and play generally follows realistic patterns, though the handling of punts and on-side kicks (both more effective than in real life) is questionable. Also, because the design changed little after its debut in 1959, the plays and defenses don't reflect the state of the art in contemporary professional football. This is the era of Otto Graham, not Eli Manning.&#10;&#10;For those who are so inclined, Football Strategy lends itself to mathematical analysis. Many years ago, an entrant into the tournament at Origins went to the trouble of using game theory to generate charts showing the optimal mix of plays in different situations. He reached the finals but, in a victory for human intuition over number crunching, lost the championship game by a touchdown and a field goal.&#10;&#10;";1959;6.43717;1.5526

963;The Gardens of the Alhambra;"The Gardens of Alhambra is an abstract influence game from Dirk Henn where each player is represented by plants of a particular color.  Using tiles with all four colors on them, the players place them onto the board in fixed locations.  In doing so, they try to surround victory point markers and capture them.  Of course, since each tile has all of the player's colors represented, every tile placement must be carefully thought-out so that you maximize your points while minimizing them for your opponents.  Ties disqualify players - and so the next highest color total will earn the points.  The player with the most victory points at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;";1993;6.16079;1.7931

965;Ben Hurt;"A chariot-racing game with pre-race rounds of card auctioning - the trick being that the race-winning &quot;pot&quot; is made up of the auction bids.   You have to balance the cost of the cards against the likely return - you want good cards cheap, and you want to force your opponents to pay over the odds for their cards.   Of course, everyone else is trying to do the same thing.&#10;&#10;However, there is a great deal of luck in the actual movement during the race, so your careful planning can be destroyed by a few poor dice rolls.&#10;&#10;";1996;5.63374;1.7407
967;Kommissar X;"The Police Commissioner is on the hunt for escaped criminals. Players build a deck of cards showing the escape route taken by the criminals. The cards are double sided, and when the deck is completed, it's turned over and players must predict the next move in the escape. Get it wrong and move your hunch marker down. Find a suitcase left by the criminals, and gain a commendation. First to get 4 medals wins.    &#10;&#10;&#10;";1992;4.90741;1.0
972;Seven Deadly Sins;"Seven Deadly Sins can be best describe as a New Age Snake-and-Ladders with Attitude. The board comprises a winding &amp; overlapping path divided into seven different incarnations -Killer, then Thief, Liar, Servant, Lover, Healer, and finally Prophet. Players must race from Creation to Nirvana through the incarnations while collecting money, Mojo, cards and other elements along the way. Some cards, Wicca Cards, can be used to cast spells so as to advance yourself or to retard the progress of others, other cards provide protection. To win you must be first to reach Nirvana with at least 50 units of Mojo.&#10;&#10;Takes around 20 mins per player (therefore 3 player games take approximately 60 mins).  Some of the content is too much for young children, thus the game's 13+ rating.&#10;&#10;";2000;4.28571;0.0
975;The Keep;"A tie-in to the horror film of the same name. One player controls the evil demon, Molasar, while the others have twelve turns to find the Hilt, the only weapon that can destroy him. It can be hidden in one of six rooms near the heart of a labyrinth. There are intriguing elements to the game; Molasar starts with twelve servants but actually has to &quot;eat&quot; one per turn, reducing his options in terms of blocking the searchers. Combat is handled by the attacked searcher nominating another searcher to play a combat card, which is compared against Molasar's; the loser is forced to &quot;retreat&quot; by the difference in values. If the searcher wins, they pick up a bonus (non-combat) card. All the searchers have (minor) special powers and Molasar has a number of one-off special cards he can play in trying to delay them.&#10;&#10;You can think of it, almost, as a very early, much simpler version of Lord of the Rings - except that in this one, one of the players gets to be Sauron!&#10;&#10;";1983;5.58541;1.6667
979;The Powerpuff Girls: Saving the World Before Bedtime;"Players all control the Powerpuff Girls on their turns via a neat card mechanism: Cards are selected and revealed at the same time, but enacted according to times printed on them. It basically comes down to wandering about the board, revealing villain tiles and battling them with the Powerpuff Girls with the goal of being the first player to capture 4 villains.&#10;&#10;The villains are captured by way of die rolls.  Each girl has an identical die, so the more of the girls you have present to combat a villain, the better your odds of capture.  ...of course, the better your odds of getting some of them knocked out for the rest of the turn.  Since everyone shares the girls, having the earliest time card, and getting the girls knocked out will impact everyone.&#10;&#10;";2000;5.88559;1.1875

Whoever makes the most profit selling beans wins (whether a player or the mafia).  There are three new bean types present, namely Stangenbohne, Puffbohne, and Kidneybohne - all of whom have beanometers which do not conform to the pattern present in the beanometers of the base game.&#10;&#10;Al Cabohne is part of the Bohnanza family of games.

983;Tangoes;"Tangoes is competitive tangrams. Each player has a tangram set (a square, a parallelogram, two small triangles, one medium triangle, and two large triangles). The basic puzzle is to assemble them into a square. However, Tangoes comes with cards showing various shapes that can be made. The two player game is to race to be first to form the shape, but just trying to solve the puzzles is an absorbing solitaire game.&#10;&#10;Tangoes' package is patented and is partly what sets it apart from other tangram-related games.  It is a travel-compatible case which holds a pack of puzzle cards and two sets of tans.   There are also at least eleven additional packs of cards available from this manufacturer, and virtually unlimited puzzles from other sources.&#10;&#10;";1980;5.73318;1.5

In this game, you try to get your partner to say as many of the ten names on your card as possible in the allotted time.  There are very few restrictions on clues.  The main twist in Name Burst is that there aren't set teams -- each player rotates giving clues to every other player, with both players scoring the full number of points each round.&#10;&#10;";1992;6.308;1.8333

986;Babel;"In Babel, each player makes use of members of various tribes of the ancient world to build temples, exploit (or exterminate) their opponent's work force, destroy or steal their opponent's temples and otherwise do whatever it takes to build the tallest temples to win the game.&#10;&#10;The game plays out on a small game board representing regions of 5 ancient civilizations, Medes, Sumerians, Hittites, Persians, and Assyrians.  Each player will be dealt a hand of cards (consisting of 5 types corresponding to the above tribes).  Players themselves are represented by stone figures.  Temple cards will be made available at the side of the board for building throughout the game.  On his or her turn, a player may discard a card to move to the corresponding region, place a card on the region they are currently located, build a temple by having tribesmen equal to the number or level on the temple card AND having built the previous (lower) temple level, move tribesmen from one region to another, or perform a skill action unique to each tribe.  Players may perform any and all actions available to them, being able to perform most actions as many times as they wish and saving any number of unplayed cards for subsequent turns.&#10;&#10;A big component of this game is placing your tribe cards in sets. Skills can only be used if a set of three (or more) cards is at the same location as the player marker.  By discarding one of the cards of a set, the skill may be used.  No matter the tribe, performing this action can force the opponent to discard half their hand.  Other skills, such as robbing a temple from an opponent, skipping a level on a temple build, destroy an opposing temple, etc. are specific to the tribe activated.&#10;&#10;Game play progresses until one of two conditions is met: if a player builds 15 points (or levels) of temples before the opposing player builds at least 10 points, that player wins.  If the opponent does have more than 10 points, the game continues until one player reaches 20 points (in which case he or she wins) OR one player subsequently drops below 10 (in which case he or she loses).&#10;&#10;";2000;6.64417;2.4034
987;Kingmaker;"Kingmaker simulates the Wars of the Roses, the period of sporadic Civil War in England between 1450 and 1490. Ruled by a weak and mentally unstable king, Henry VI, demoralized by the defeat in France at the end of the Hundred Years War, and encouraged by the ambitions of Richard, Duke of York, and his sons; the country's noble families used their large private armies in attempts to gain control of the throne.&#10; The game is based on the premise that the powerful Noble families used the Lancastrian and Yorkist princes as pawns in a greater struggle to gain control of England. The nobles in a player's faction use their military and political powers to gain control of royal heirs in an effort to crown one and put him or her on the throne. Of course everyone is out to capture and control the last heir alive, so once acquired, an heir needs to be protected. &#10; Kingmaker has been published by several companies, starting with Philmar under their Ariel imprint in 1974, by Avalon Hill in 1976, by Gibsons Games in 1983, and by TM Games in 1988/9. In 2023, Gibsons Games published a new edition, which has its own entry under Kingmaker (2023).&#10;&#10;";1974;6.53844;3.0556
988;Zapp Zerapp;"This is a very novel take on the old parlor game, Parcheesi or Sorry or even Trouble, that many people remember. Players are trying to get their pawns from their starting position around the board into the safe zone. If a pawn is either landed on or passed over by another player's pawn, the jumped pawn is returned to its starting location. However, players don't simply roll the dice and move in Zap Zerapp. Instead, two dice are rolled and results are announced to the table. Players simultaneously start picking up one of the thirteen little wooden containers and shaking them. Inside the containers are one to thirteen lead pellets. Players are trying to select the container with the highest number of pellets, so long as it doesn't exceed the result of the dice. Once all players have selected their container (the number of pellets are denoted on a sticker on the bottom), players move one-by-one from highest to lowest, assuming their selection allows them to move at all by being lower.&#10;&#10;";2000;6.09391;1.3

On a turn, a player moves one marble in an orthogonal direction, and the marble moves as many spaces as the number of marbles in the row perpendicular to the direction being moved.

The object of Alcazar is to either immobilize your opponent's pawn by enclosing it within four walls or to occupy his/her starting square.  The game comes with a red and a green pawn, 8 walls, and a board with a 4x4 grid of what appear to be castles.  Walls can be placed between any two adjacent castles forming a border.&#10;&#10;The two pieces begin on their respective starting squares, which are located diagonally across the board from each other. Each piece begins surrounded by 4 walls. The object is to move one of the walls on each turn in order to either move your piece to your opponent's starting square or to enclose your opponent's piece so that it can no longer move.&#10;&#10;";1978;5.82857;1.6667

Water tiles serve to flood the fields and players score most points for producing the freshest produce.&#10;&#10;Originally produced for the 1992 Hippodice Spieleautorenwettbewerb (Hippodice game author competition).&#10;&#10;";1994;6.364;2.3448
994;Auf Trab im Sulkydrom;"Sulkydrom is Trap racing round a circuit, basically modern 'chariot' racing, popular in continental Europe and the southern US, but unseen in Britain. The eight horses are named from Atletico to Happy Days and you play either Horse or Position cards to allow each to move, with the leading horse going first. The cards show the lengths they may move from 0 to 4 including half lengths, e.g. 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5 etc. Shifting lanes costs 1 length, but the Sulky only moves forward a half length. As with many such games, the inside lane has fewer spaces on the bend than the outside lanes. But if you are blocked in and cannot move, you miss your go completely. Taking the inside line therefore is quicker, but makes it easier for others to block you. Each player also has a Joker and Gallop card to help themselves and hinder others once in the game. The races are meant to be quick and the designer encourages betting on them, but doesn't give a method. A solid, colorful production with a jigsaw board, the game comes packaged in a large wooden box with sliding card lid.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.2;1.5

997;Canaletto;"An open auction game, players bid for the heirlooms in Venetian palaces, which then get sold on as groups are completed. A circuit of palaces is seeded with the items, and a marker shows which palace is being auctioned. As players bid, they move a gondola along the circuit, which points which the next auction will be when this one is resolved. Players start with 30 points on the scoring track, and there's a marker to allow debt on the same track. Debt costs double at the game end. There's also a marker to allow you to bribe the auctioneer and take a lot for no cost.&#10;&#10;A series price tiles show the potential value of the next completed lot. So you might get to sell your pictures for 16 each, but you might be forced to sell when the price is only 4 each.&#10;&#10;The game is totally open, and you can do the maths to work out the potential benefits to each player, but the game remains fun and quick. Tying the next auction to the current price is a clever idea too, and it can be worth bidding a bit more to control where the next auction will be. Long out of print, Canaletto stands up well with auction games like Medici.&#10;&#10;This later saw incarnations in 1996 as Le Jardin and 2000 as Der Garten des Sonnenk&#195;&#182;nigs.&#10;&#10;";1995;5.3783;1.7143

1000;Corona;"Corona is a puzzle-style game, with players trying to collect as many chips as possible. The game board shows a circuit course of 12 smaller circles. Before each round, the players distribute 6 pawns on the course. One player then rolls all 6 dice and turns over the timer. Players now assign the dice to the pawns and try to determine the highest score possible. The player announcing the highest number before the timer runs out performs his move. &#10;Each pawn moves, in clockwise order, the number of spaces shown on it assigned die and scores 1 point for each pawn on the space it ends its move. If the player managed to meet or exceed his/her predicted number, the player receives a chip from every other player; if not, the player gives a chip to each player and sits out the next round.&#10;The game ends after a player ends up without chips, with twice the original number of chips, or after a predefined number of turns or a set amount of time.&#10;Corona was published in the Ravensburger Casino Series.&#10;The introductionary (and a few other) variation(s) from Corona were republished as 'Moonstar' in 1981 (by Avalon Hill).&#10;Moonstar was rethemed as 'Harun' in 1984 (by Edition Perlhuhn).&#10;In 1993 Corona was republished and got a new variant included  as 'Orbit' (by Franckh-Kosmos).&#10;&#10;";1974;6.35403;2.3333

1002;Cosmic Eidex;"Cosmic Eidex is an intriguing little trick-taking game for 3 players. The deck consists of 36 cards, 6 thru Ace, in four suits: Hearts (red), Lizard (green), Raven (black) and Stars (yellow). The Cosmic characters are the heart of the game, providing each player with a special Cosmic power. Each player draws one randomly at game start.&#10;&#10;In Cosmic Eidex, the idea is to take either the most points or the least points (designated by the trump and rank of the cards that you take each hand), to earn a victory point. If in a hand, one player exceeds 100 card points, then the other two players get 1 victory point each. If one player takes all of the tricks, she receives 2 victory points. Seven victory points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Cosmic Eidex is a mutation of the ages-old Swiss trick-taking card game Jass. Like Skat, the traditional German trick-taking card game, it is a three-player game.&#10;&#10;The Cosmic-like powers each player is given are relatively weak. Most allow the player to break one of the rules once per game (before, during or after), some can be used multiple times. You don&rsquo;t need to know every characters' powers, just the powers of the three characters used in the current game. There are as many character/power possibilities as there are cards, but wise card play usually outweighs their influence.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.86347;2.7333

The other players also get 7 chips each according to their seating (not the place cards).

1004;Der Feuersalamander;"Der Feuersalamander is a deduction game with a fantasy theme. The game board shows four distinct areas associated with the four elements (air, water, fire, earth). Each area has 7 rows and three columns, showing 1,2, or 3 stones.&#10;&#10;The players try to deduce a set of 3 cards (1 element, 1 row number, 1 number of stones) in play from their own and other players' cards. A player can have a maximum of two cards in their hands, and they have to be different types (e.g., no 2 element cards). On their turn, a player rolls the special dice, showing both a symbol and a number. If the salamander is rolled as the symbol, the player gets to pick up a card. If the stone symbol is rolled, the player &#10;marks one of the possible positions on the board represented by their cards on the board. In any case, the player moves their pawn according to the number rolled.&#10;&#10;If another player reaches a space with another player's marker, they can ask that player for a specific card. The player has to show the questioner a Yes/No card to indicate their answer.&#10;&#10;Once a player knows a set of cards, they move their pawn back to their own starting location. Upon arrival, the player states the set of cards and who has the missing card(s). If the statement is true, the player receives a number of points; if not, they end up in the dungeon. The game ends after a player reaches a certain number of points.&#10;&#10;Der Feuersalamander is the third game in Noris' Fantasy trilogy, with Die Drei Magier and Das Blaue Amulett being the first and second.&#10;&#10;";1987;5.90045;2.2222

Each player has 2 pawns and you can always move your pawn either direction, so a player has four choices of possible moves with each roll. It takes two pawns to close a gate, but players can collaborate to close a gate. The tiger is moved to a gate. Once a gate is closed, the tigers will never move toward it.&#10;The mother tiger is trying to find her child and she moves automaticly each turn towards an open gate.

The exchanged goods must either be brought back for domestic storage (on the storage card) or to trade offices in other harbors, in exchange for other needed products.&#10;&#10;On the storage cards each Hansa merchant finds the products that he must in the course of the game, put in storage. Once a merchant fills his storage card, the game ends and the winner is determined.&#10;&#10;During this time period, wares were transported in sailing ships, cogs or later holks. To reduce the risk of such a dangerous and uncertain journey, merchants formed so-called companies with one or several partners and thereby distributed valuable loads on several ships.&#10;&#10;In this game each player shares a Hansa cog with his left and right-hand neighbors. And there are risks to the voyage on all sides.

The players each take five snake cards and place them behind their screens, so that the other players cannot see them.&#10;&#10;Players take their turns in clockwise order.

To pick up a card, a player has to either move his/her apprentice and magician onto the same location (if the location still has a card left), or duel with another player, if the two players' magicians end up on the same location.&#10;&#10;Die Drei Magier is the first game in Noris' Fantasy trilogy, with Das Blaue Amulett and Der Feuersalamander being the second and third.&#10;&#10;";1985;5.76532;1.9091
1013;Energie Poker;"Players are responsible for fulfilling the energy requirements for their countries throughout the years.  Each year there are exactly enough resources to fulfill and the players have to decide which resources to claim for themselves.  It's a simultaneous selection of the resources, so you don't know what the others are choosing.  Sometimes you don't quite fill all your energy needs, so you have to buy resources from other players or the bank to cover.  Action and event cards modify the energy market from year to year, and clever play of these cards can turn the tide of the game.  The player with the most cash at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Even though the game says it supports up to 5 players, the fifth player's responsibility is to be the banker.&#10;&#10;";1980;6.64;2.6667

1018;Galaxis;"There are 18 Planet cards, 15 Multiplier cards and 24 Value cards. Players start the game with six Value cards (values one to six) which they use to bid on the other cards. Each turn, three cards are auctioned. Each player can bid a number of face-down Value cards. It is allowed to make two or three seperate bids. After everyone has bid, the bids are turned face-up, and the three highest bidders receive a card, with the highest bidder choosing first. The winner can keep the card, or, if it is a negative one, give it to an opponent.&#10;&#10;The Planets and Multipliers may be placed alone, but they may also be added to a single card that is already in play to create a scoring Multiplier-Planet pair. Planets have a value from -3 to 3, Multipliers are x0, x1 or x2, with a pair scoring the Value of the planet times the value of the Multiplier.&#10;&#10;After the cards have been auctioned off, all bids are passed to the left, so each player gains those Value cards bid by their right-hand opponent.&#10;&#10;The auctions continue until all but three cards have been auctioned. Now, each player's final score is calculated. The pairs are separated by Planet colour (red, green or yellow). For each colour, the player scores a number of points equal to the number of pairs of that colour times the total score of the pairs of that colour. The scores for the separate colours are added. The player with the highest score wins the game.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.76786;2.0

1028;Kraut & RÃ¼ben;"Kraut &amp; R&uuml;ben is Cabbage &amp; Beets but means higgledy-piggledy. Players try to construct a market garden, which best matches their secret scoring card. The gardens start in the middle (one more than the number of players). Players draw tiles and place vegetables, weeds, snails and moles in different plots. When you feel one garden looks good to you, you grab it for your score at the end. However, other players can continue to place tiles in your garden until one space remains. The scoring card shows a grid, you score for 2 plants based on a 3rd, so if you have 2 cabbages, your carrots will score 3 pts and your asparagus will score 4 pts each. But get another cabbage and the points drop, so you have to control your garden to get the optimum score.&#10;&#10;A good, simple, fun game, this will entertain but not stretch gamers and is a great intro for kids and non-gamers.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.96639;1.1818

1031;TV Wars;"TV Wars is a game of television network battles for ratings.  Each player plays one of four semi-fictional TV networks, and the goal is to end up with the most money when the game ends (which is either when only one network is left on the air, or when certain tiles run out).&#10;Players move pawns around a standard square-track board, with spaces that trigger various events -- drawing an event card, auctioning off a new TV show or star or academy award movie, or triggering a ratings war.&#10;During a ratings war, players lay out the tiles representing their prime-time line-up of shows and movies, along with bonuses for stars and reviews.  Shows with the lowest ratings in their time slot are cancelled, and when a network has no shows left, it goes off the air and the player is out of the game.&#10;&#10;";1987;5.58343;1.9286
1032;B-17: Queen of the Skies;"B-17: Queen of the Skies is a strategy game which re-creates the early bombing missions and aerial combat of the B-17 (F Model) bombers of the US Eighth Air Force over Europe between November 1942 and May 1943. Movement to targets is through zones. Die rolls and game tables determine appearance, type, and position of enemy fighters. Charts are used to determine if hits are made, where the damage is located, and how serious the damage is.  Game tables and die rolls also determine everything from the bomber's target and formation position to weather, flak, and German fighter opposition as the B-17 makes its way over land and sea to its target.&#10;&#10;The game has a low complexity and typically, the playing time is generally less than one hour after your first few games.&#10;&#10;B-17 is designed to be primarily a solitaire game. The player controls a B-17F Flying Fortress bomber, trying to survive German fighter attacks and drop its load of bombs on the selected target, then return home safely. Optionally, a second player can control the German fighters (to some degree; their appearance is determined randomly, but successive attacks are under the control of the German player). If each player has their own copy of B-17, then they can fly their bomber while playing the same mission as part of the formation.&#10;&#10;";1981;7.13242;2.3306

1035;Squad Leader;"A shot disturbs the eerie silence of a deserted city street, punctuated by the frantic footfalls of men seeking cover. One of Kruger&rsquo;s last veteran NCO&rsquo;s lies motionless in the street. The remnants of the dead man&rsquo;s squad are nowhere to be seen&mdash;scattered in nearby houses and gutters&mdash;all thoughts of the advance abandoned with the sudden demise of their leader...the compulsion for revenge obviously overcome by their instinct for self-preservation. Off to the right, Kruger&rsquo;s own men have located the source of the lethal shot and are laying down a steady stream of fire on the church steeple directly ahead. The absence of responding fire suggests that the lone Russian marksman has beat a hasty retreat or been victimized by the withering fire of the German retort. Kruger has seen enough. He is to occupy the church and set up a regimental observation post at once. His orders leave no leeway for delays by a single sniper. He gives the signal to rush the building. Obedient to their training, his men, veterans of France, the Balkans, and 18 months of fighting in Russia, spring to their feet. Seconds later the sharp, staccato retort of a Russian machinegun concludes with the assertiveness of death itself that this time Kruger was wrong.&#10;&#10;This is Squad Leader, a game of WWII tactical combat in Europe. You make the instant decisions resulting in life or death for your men, victory or defeat for your army. You direct the fire of your squad, select your plan of attack, or set your defenses against massed Russian human wave or armor assaults. Will that hedgerow provide adequate cover for your flanking efforts, or will your men be cut down by the American machinegun position in the woods? The decision is irrevocable and yours alone.&#10;&#10;Squad Leader is more than just a game, it is a game system which can be used to portray any WWII infantry action. Its system does for infantry combat what Panzerblitz and Panzer Leader have done for armored warfare games. Squad Leader provides rules for morale, leadership, machineguns, flamethrowers, demo charges, smoke, hidden placement, sewer movement, off-board artillery, radio contact, anti-tank guns, night actions, wire, entrenchments, mines, bunkers, rubble, multi-story building differentiation, fire, river crossings, roadblocks, mortars, and much more.&#10;&#10;Squad Leader utilizes programmed instruction to guide you through 12 scenarios of increasing realism and complexity. The scenarios run the gamut from street fighting in Stalingrad to armored advances across snow covered roads in the Ardennes. A Campaign Game ties the individual scenarios together and allows your own personal leader counter to advance in rank and ability. In addition, a &ldquo;Design Your Own&rdquo; section is included so that players can create an unlimited number of play situations of their own creation.&#10;&#10;Each hex in Squad Leader represents 40 meters of real terrain with counters representing individual leaders, support weapons, and vehicles or 4 man crews and 12 man squads. Each game turn is divided into two player turns with 8 phases, equivalent to two minutes of actual time.&#10;&#10;Squad Leader is not an easy game. Do not attempt it without prior wargaming experience. Squad Leader is rated Tournament Level IV on the A.H. Complexity scale.&#10;&#10;";1977;7.56299;4.0328
1036;Speculation;"In Speculation, players buy and sell shares of stock, trying to have the most money at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Each player has a hand of nine cards; eight of them match the company shares that are available for purchase, while the ninth card is a &quot;Bank Holiday&quot; card. Each of the eight companies has 2-5 shares available, depending on the number of players, and each player starts with a randomly drawn share. At the start of the game, place six movement tiles (numbered 1-6) in one bag and six action tiles (trade x3, rank +1, rank -1, no action) in another bag.&#10;&#10;Each round, the starting player draws one tile from each bag. If he draws a rank +1 or rank -1, he moves one share price indicator (a.k.a. &quot;brick&quot;) of his choice up or down one rank on the movement track that organizes the company bricks. If he draws a trade, each player buys and/or sells one share to the bank. Players then simultaneously choose one of the two cards in their hand and reveal them. If no one played a bank holiday card, then in turn order, the brick associated with each company card advances on the movement track a number of spaces equal to the movement tile drawn, ignoring occupied spaces. The value of a company's shares depends on the location of its brick on the movement track and its position relative to all of the other bricks. If one or more bank holiday cards were played, the bricks move only half the distance or don't move at all.)&#10;&#10;Players each draw a new card, and the bags pass to the next player in clockwise order, who becomes the starting player for the next round. If a trade tile was drawn, return all tiles to their respective bags first. The rounds continue until one or more company bricks reach the end of the movement track. At the end of that round, players cash out their holdings and whoever has the most money wins.&#10;&#10;";1992;6.68663;2.0189

A player wins at the end of a turn if he or she has more victory points + control points than any other player.&#10;&#10;Doomtown is set apart from other games in CCG market by its unique poker-based combat resolution, as well as by the way in which the town is built up through the game by the use of Deed cards. Outfits range from the good-guy Law Dogs to the mysterious Sioux Union to the nefarious Whateley clan.&#10;&#10;A turn is played out over one &quot;day&quot;.&#10;In the gambling phase players play a hand of &quot;Lowball&quot; ( Unlike other Doomtown poker hands, the lowest hand wins.), to determine who will go first for the rest of the turn. &#10;Next in the upkeep phase, income is collected and upkeep for Dudes from another outfit are paid for.&#10;The next phase is &quot;High Noon&quot;, during this phase, shopping and trading, moving, acting and calling out (all specific actions related to the game play) are taken. &#10;Finally, there is the Nightfall phase, during this phase, the events of the day are discarded, players hands are replenished and cards are returned to their &quot;ready&quot; state.&#10;&#10;";1998;7.25682;3.0167
1038;Tantrix;"Tantrix is a strategy game using painted synthetic resin hexagons (often mistakenly thought to be Bakelite). It was invented in New Zealand, and is clearly derived from the earlier Psyche-paths/Kaliko. Tantrix can be played as solitaire puzzles, ranging from easy to almost impossible, or as a multiplayer strategy game featuring a combination of strategy, luck and skill. Each tile has three tracks on it, in three different colors (out of four colors). Each track starts on one side of the tile and ends on another. The goal of the game is to create the longest line or loop of your chosen color. If you create a closed loop, each tile counts for two points.&#10;&#10;Each player has an open hand of six tiles. When it is your turn, you must first play tiles in any spaces that are &quot;required play&quot; (any hole that has at least three tiles bordering it is a required play). After each played tile, you randomly draw a new tile. Once you've filled all required spaces, you play one tile in any legal space. After that, you once again need to fill required spaces. To play the game well, you need to create required spaces in smart ways. This way you can both enable yourself to play more tiles during your turn and force your opponent to play tiles that continue your track (remember that your opponent's hand is open, so try to create required spaces that take advantage of his tiles).&#10;&#10;The full version contains 56 tiles.&#10;&#10;Note that there are also smaller solo brain teaser puzzles that are Outside the Scope of BGG. The 10-tile version is a color matching puzzle. Arrange the tiles so that all the colored lines match where the tiles touch each other. Additionally, for each puzzle challenge, select one color, and create a closed loop. Begin the easy puzzle by using the first four tiles (which are numbered on the reverse side 1, 2, 3 &amp; 4). Increase the level of difficulty by adding the fifth tile, then 6th tile etc. Comes in Green &amp; Black.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    Tantrix Gobble&#10;    The Mind Game&#10;    Kaliko (Psyche-Paths)&#10;&#10;&#10;";1991;6.3626;2.2236
1041;San Marco;"Players are attempting to score the most points by building up influence in the districts of Venice via their aristocrats. The game uses a card distribution mechanic whereby (in the case of a four-player game) two players draw cards and divide them up into two piles each, the other two players pick one group and the remaining groups go to the players who formed the groups. The action cards allow players to place and remove aristocrats, erect and move bridges, and score individual regions. The entire game lasts three Passages and each Passage may contain several turns.&#10;&#10;62 Action cards:&#10;   30 District (5 for each district)&#10;    6 Bridge&#10;   12 Transfer&#10;   10 Doge&#10;    4 Banishment&#10;&#10;28 Limit cards:&#10;   8 X &quot;1&quot;&#10;   10 X &quot;2&quot;&#10;   10 X &quot;3&quot;&#10;&#10;Related game:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Canal Grande is a two-player card game based on this game.&#10;&#10;&#10;";2001;7.17474;2.6749
1042;Dragon's Gold;"In Dragon's Gold, each player controls a team of dragon hunters (two knights, a thief, and a wizard). Like all dragon hunters, they have only one goal: gold, silver, jewels and magic objects. As for actually killing a dragon? It's a piece of cake. But the most difficult part comes after the dragon is dead: the adventuring party has to figure out how to share the spoils.&#10;&#10;As soon as a dragon is overpowered, then some additional gems are revealed, and the players who had participated in that hunting party start a negotiation over how to divvy up the gems. If the sixty-second sand timer runs out, then no one gets treasure. When all of the dragons have been slain and the treasure claimed or discarded, the game ends and players score for their holdings, with silver and magic objects worth 1 point each, gold worth 3, the Black Diamond worth 7, and the colored gems scoring 10-15 points for those players who hold more than everyone else. (In the Advanced game, the colored gems score 8-12 points in addition to a variety bonus of 5 points for each set of different colored gems a player holds. The Black Diamond is worth 19 points [in the 2011 edition], but negates a player's score for all colored gems.)&#10;&#10;";2001;6.42472;1.6943
1043;Pitstop;"PITSTOP is a motor racing board game. 65 special tiles let the player build virtually any circuit they like. The game comes with multilingual rules (english, spanish, italian, german and french) and instructions to build 10 different F1 circuits.&#10;Each player must set the gear and roll an appropriate number of special dice, that determine the speed of the car and the fuel consuption. The game is turn based and the phasing player, after moving his car, must set the gear for next turn. The box strategy is the most important decision to take. You can decide to complete all the 3 laps without stopping or making one or two pitstops.&#10;The game is not a &quot;simulation&quot;, but to win you need a good amount of skill. Even if the speed of your car is determined by dice, you have to choose carefully the &quot;braking point&quot; in order to enter the curves at the best speed. If you exceed the curve's speed limit, you lose &quot;tyres points&quot;. Of course, you can simulate a championship playing different circuits. What's interesting is that the game strategy changes from circuit to circuit and if you design your own circuit you need all your &quot;driving skill&quot; to be competitive. Rookies can win, but they will find very hard to beat a skilled player.&#10;Game components: 65 tiles to build the circuits (an avarege of 25 tiles are needed for each circuit), 6 plastic sport cars, 12 special dice, 6 &quot;dashboards&quot;, 40 speed limit tokens, 24 plastic pawns, one rules booklet.&#10;&#10;";2001;6.32051;1.5714
1044;Gunslinger;"&quot;Fill Yore Hand ...&quot; with Gunslinger, the game of western gunfights. In Gunslinger, you play the part of a western character who is caught in a sudden gunfight, and you face the split-second decisions and incidents of the showdown as bullets start to fly.&#10;&#10;Gunslinger is based on a quick and easy game system that recreates the split-second nature of gunplay. Each turn the players secretly play cards to define exactly what they will do during the next two seconds in the game. Then they step through these actions on the playing map, resolving each shot in the split-second when it takes place. Gunslinger resolves combat quickly and easily. The attacker draws a result card that shows exactly where the shot hits, which combines with his/her weapon to determine the damage inflicted. This recreates the critical differences between weapons: Winchesters, Shotguns, Buffalo rifles, Colt's &quot;Peacemaker&quot;, Smith &amp; Wesson's breakopen guns and Remington's Derringer are a few of the guns in the game.&#10;&#10;Gunslinger includes eight two-sided boards (a total of sixteen map faces) portraying town and countryside terrain at a scale of six feet per hex. These boards can be assembled in varying ways to create a vast number of different maps that are used in the gunfights. The terrain includes gullies, hills, trees, watering troughs, wells, hitching posts and the interiors of buildings.&#10;&#10;Gunslinger presents 26 different gunfights and several hundred variations, including both historical gunfights and made-up situations. Wild Bill Hickok, Billy the Kid, Wyatt Earp, and John Wesley Hardin are just a few of the real gunslingers of history who appear in re-creations of the gunfights that made them famous.  Indian raids, barroom brawls and poker games are just a few of the hypothetical situations.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Component List(From box back, augmented with detail from Wayne's Books page)&#10;&#10;&#10;     Rules&#10;     8x two-sided mapboards&#10;     Result card deck (108)&#10;     Pad of personal history sheets&#10;     Countersheet&#10;         60 round (people)&#10;         112 medium square (objects)&#10;         96 small square (tactical)&#10;         9 large (horses)&#10;    &#10;     Action Cards (130)&#10;         7x standard sets of 12 each&#10;         4x B1&#10;         7x B2&#10;         7x B3&#10;         5x B4&#10;         5x B5&#10;         5x B6&#10;         5x B7&#10;         4x B8&#10;         4x B9&#10;    &#10;     &quot;Second Floor&quot; player-aid cards x4&#10;&#10;&#10;";1982;7.15978;3.2903

They now take turns and choose one of the following three actions.&#10;&#10;1.Move: Players can move the chosen piece as many squares sideways, forwards or backwards as the piece has balls, if it has 4 balls it must move 4 squares. The pieces may neither jump nor change direction.&#10;&#10;2.Sharing: Players may take all the balls from a selected piece and place one each on any of their other pieces. Exception, if a tower has six balls only five balls may be placed on the other five pieces and so one ball is lost and is removed from the game.&#10;&#10;3.Capturing: Only balls are captured, not pieces. The capturing piece and the threatened piece stay on their own squares. Example a white piece and a brown piece stand two squares apart. They have two balls and three balls respectively. It is whites move and white can remove the three brown balls from the game as long as there is no piece between the white and brown pieces. Pieces whose balls have been captured can be activated again by the sharing of balls.&#10;&#10;Therefore, capturing only limits the movement possibilities, the number of pieces always remains the same. If a player loses all their balls they can no longer move and have lost.&#10;&#10;";1986;6.31734;2.4
1046;Max.X;"extrapolated from translation&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;15 colored dice&#10;    1 special die (grey)&#10;    1 board&#10;    1 set of rules&#10;&#10;Aim of the game&#10;To fill zones of 2 or 3 spaces with dice showing the same number, and if possible of the same color. More points are gained if these are also in the same circle.&#10; How the game is played:  &#10; This player will throw the dice 5 times in order to place all the dice on the board.&#10;1.The player throws one die of each color along with the special die.&#10;2.The player checks the special die in order to see what possibilities are open to him for changing the outcome of his throw and improving the position. The value of the numbers of the dice does not affect the result.&#10;&#10;Explanation of the symbols of the special die:&#10;The side which has two dice drawn on it permits the player to change the number on 1 or 2 of the the 3 dice thrown to match the number showing one of the other die.&#10;&#10;The side which has one die drawn on it permits the player to change the number of one of the dice thrown to match the number on one of the other two dice thrown.&#10;&#10;The symbol of the 2 half circles with arrow heads allows the user to interchange the position of two dice already placed by him on the board with a view to ending up with a group of dice with the same numbers and, even better, of the same color as well.&#10;&#10;The symbol of the 3 small squares with a divided arrow coming from middle one allows the player to change the number on a die which has already been placed on the board or which the player is about to place on the board, to any other number.&#10;&#10;The Flying Turtle is the super bonus. It allows the player to do all the moves which are permitted by the other symbols on the special die.  Further more, when placed in the center of the board it increases the players points considerably.&#10;&#10;&#10;3. Once the player's throw has been adjusted to take into account the special die, the player places his dice in the zone or zones of his choice.  He will in so doing try to fill the empty spaces in a circle with dice with the same numbers and if possible, of the same color.&#10;&#10;End of the game:&#10;The player who has the highest score after 5 turns wins.&#10;&#10;";1989;6.26923;1.6667
1047;MeM;"from the rules:&#10;&#10;Equipment&#10;A board with 32 indented spaces&#10;32 stones of 11 colours (8+7+3+3+2+2+2+2+1+1+1) Two rules booklets.&#10;&#10;To Start&#10;At the start of the game, the 32 stones are spread randomly over the board surface so that all spaces are filled.  The board is set between the players, leaving a space in front of each player.&#10;&#10;For MEM-Solitaire, you need only one playing space and the filled board.&#10;&#10;The General Idea&#10;You take stones from the MEM board, and use them to build patterns of stones in your playing area.  The pattern of stones in your playing area must always &quot;match&quot; some group of stones remaining on the board.  In two-person play, your opponent will try to take stones that make it easy for him to build matching patterns, and make it hard for you to find good matches on the board.  The player with the most stones wins.&#10;&#10;";1968;7.34474;3.625
1050;Momo;"extrapolated from English rules:&#10;&#10;A co-operative game for two to six players twelve years old or more.&#10;&#10;Contents&#10;&#10;A board in two parts&#10;Two colored wooden pieces (Momo and the tortoise Kassiopeia)&#10;12 colored wooden discs (the hour flowers)&#10;84 hexagonal cards and 4 spare cards&#10;    - top side : dream pictures or question marks&#10;    - under side: green or grey&#10;&#10;One day the children notice that people have less and less time.  Momo finds out that spooky 'grey men'  are tempting people to bring them their time to save it in a time savings bank.  In fact they are stealing their time.  The more time they save, the colder, sadder, more hurried and poor their existence becomes.&#10;&#10;Finally, with the help of a wonder flower and Master Hora's advice, Momo and Kassiopeia the tortoise, try to beat the grey men and give the people back their time.&#10;&#10;&#10;Momo and Kassiopeia must find the way to Master Hora and meet each other at the gate to the never-alley. But how?  Momo has a dream.  She sees a picture that shows the way.  Kassiopeia also has a dream.  It is as if she goes along a dream street and after a long time meets Momo at the gate to the never-alley.&#10;&#10;First, the players split into two groups.&#10;One group takes the yellow Momo figure, all the cards with the yellow edges, and one half of the board.&#10;The other group takes the brown Kassiopeia figure, all the cards with brown edges, and the other half of the board.&#10;IMPORTANT:&#10;The two groups don't play against each other but with one another.  Each group respects the other and doesn&rsquo;t make things too difficult or too easy.&#10;&#10;The start of the game&#10;&#10;The two groups sit apart from each other so that they cannot see the other half of the board, preferably on two separate tables.&#10;&#10;Each group sorts their cards.  The green cards and the grey cards are separated. At first, only the green cards are used, as well as the Gigi and Beppo cards.&#10;&#10;Each Group now lays a selected card, with a dream picture showing,  on a space on the board.  But not on one of the three approaches to the never-alley.  This card is the start square.  Momo and Kassiopeia are placed here on their respective boards.&#10;&#10;For the first game, the path should not be more than ten cards long.  See the illustration.&#10;&#10;The storytelling begins&#10;&#10;In turn, each group tells the other a story, involving the dream pictures on the chosen path.  For each question mark on the path, the group thinks up their own imaginary picture.&#10;The other group listens carefully and tries to remember the story.&#10;&#10;After the two stories have been told, the grey cards are placed on the empty squares of the board (colored pictures face up). The whole board is now full of dream pictures and question marks, and the original path is no longer clear.&#10;&#10;The two groups come together and put the two halves of the board together.  Each group now positions itself by the other half of the board and will soon move the figure which goes with that half.&#10;&#10;Momo and Kassiopeia run through the city&#10;&#10;At last Momo and Kassiopeia set off.  Each group moves their figure in turn onto an adjacent space.  It is important that all the players should participate by recalling the story they heard and they should all agree which space the figure should move to.&#10;Before either Momo or Kassiopeia is placed on a new card, the card is turned over.  If the underside is green the card remains turned and the figure steps onto it.  But if it is grey, the world, once again, becomes a little colder, and an hour flower is taken to the time-store of the grey men.  Master Hora's flower is left until last.&#10;Momo and Kassiopeia may not step on the grey cards.&#10;&#10;Gigi and Beppo help Momo and Kassiopeia.  If a group finds one of the friends, this group may expose any chosen card.  In this case, no flower need be given up if the chosen card is grey.&#10;&#10;When Momo or Kassiopeia reach the gate to the never-alley,  they wait there for each other and go together to Master Hora.  Master Hora gives them his flower and so Momo and Kassiopeia free all the captured flowers.  The flowers are given back to the people.  Together you have won the game.  If Master Hora has to give up his flower to the grey men no more can be done.  Momo and Kassiopeia, together, have lost the game.&#10;&#10;";1987;6.64286;2.0

1063;Schraumen;"Schraumen is a card game based on a nonsense culture, enacting nonsensical laws written on scrolls, paid for with plums.  The name of the game is a portmanteau word from the German Schriftrollen (Scrolls) and Pflaumen (plums).&#10;&#10;The 77 scroll cards are shuffled and the top 11 removed from the game without looking at them.  Deal each player three scrolls and give each player seven plum tokens, which are both money for bidding and victory points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Each scroll is a rule of the game that must be followed when the scroll is played.  If a rule cannot be followed, the scroll is burned in the fire - that is, removed from the game.  Examples include, &quot;Each player must put three plums in the garden,&quot; if at least one player has fewer than three plums.  Or, &quot;The player with the most plums must give all other players a plum,&quot; if two or more players are tied for having the most plums.&#10;&#10;Players take turns reading the scrolls they wish, enacting the new laws, all of which involve plum distribution in some way.  You don't have to enact any of your scrolls unless you have more than five, at which point you MUST activate (or burn, if illegal) enough to bring your hand down to five cards.  A player then draws a scroll, reads it silently, and auctions it off without telling the others what's on it.  He may bid for it himself.&#10;&#10;The game ends when either all scrolls are taken or when the text of a read scroll requires the game to end.  The player with the most plums wins.&#10;&#10;";1992;5.42336;1.1429
1065;Vigo;"Sailing into the Bay of Treasure, players move their ships over the tiles, collecting ones which construct treasure chests, or are used as events. Building a chest of your own colour scores more than tiles of your opponent's colours or plain brown ones. Complete a chest of 4 to 10 pieces, score it then start again. Events include flipping tiles on the board and stealing tiles from chests for yourself.&#10;&#10;";1994;5.918;1.5714
1069;Head Quarter;"Each player sits on opposites of a large silouhette head with empty space in the middle.  Each player draws cubes from a bag (two colored cubes glued together, making more of a rectangle--much like three-dimensional short Tetris pieces) and places their piece in the empty space in the head (the empty space is two cubes deep).  They can orient the blocks in any fashion they like.&#10;&#10;Play continues until one player fills their side (later rules contradict this and that usually dictates whether someone will like the game or not).  Then players score by tallying up the different chunks of color on their side of the head (larger areas of the same color score more).&#10;&#10;At least in the first edition, the head is mighty wobbly.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.212;1.8

The architects place 22 identical pieces to try to get the best score. However at this place is Ah Puch, the god of death and destruction. Ah Puch tries to disrupt construction as much as he can.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you must place one of the identical pieces which twist in three dimensions. The object is to place blocks at the third level on two sides of the structure. Any part of a piece may never rise above the third level. This makes the game feel like you are assembling a giant 3D jigsaw puzzle. The 3rd player takes on the role of Ah Puch, the destructive god. Ah Puch tries to keep the other two players from making a high score.&#10;&#10;The box/game board is a large, truncated pyramid in blue with finished wooden top.

Take a corner and put the marbles of your color in the groove on the edge. Each player starts with 5 marbles. The sixth is a spare, but you can leave it in the groove to mark which player is which color.&#10;&#10;Rules: Roll the marbles onto the board. You can swing, drop or spin a marble onto the board. Ignore the rules for removing marbles until all of the marbles have a home on the board.&#10;&#10;The youngest player starts. He takes the big marble and rolls it onto the board. He should try to push opponent's marbles to the inside and his own to the outside. Let the ball roll around until all marbles settle.&#10;&#10;End of a turn: At the end of the turn if a player has a majority of marbles in the innermost circle, that player must remove a marble. Only one marble is removed per turn and the owning player chooses which to remove.&#10;&#10;If there is no obvious majority (2 or more players are tied) in the innermost circle, no marble is removed. If there are no marbles in the innermost circle, then consider the marbles in the next circle out. If there is a majority, a marble will be removed. If there are no marbles in the inner two circles, then look at the 3rd circle out. If the third circle is empty, no marbles will be removed. Check for removing marbles at the end of each turn.&#10;&#10;End of Game: A player with no more marbles is out of the game.&#10;&#10;Last player to have marbles on the board wins.&#10;&#10;";1995;7.0;1.0

1083;Hexenjagd;"from the review:&#10;&#10;The central bit of the game is a giant lazy Susan with several compartments each covered with a large plastic witch hat. One of the compartments contains a strange little laughing witch that cackles when you spin the lazy Susan. The speaker lines up with holes in the bottom of the unit to help mask where the sound is coming from. The center of the lazy Susan has a giant plastic witch in the middle to complete the effect.&#10;&#10;The idea of the game involves rolling dice to move, then occasionally spinning the witches. When you spin the witches, you must then try to locate the laughing witch by tracking the sound.&#10;&#10;";1993;4.16667;0.0

1087;Matschig;"In Matschig, players sling mud at one another by throwing water and sand cards. Well, okay, not literally throwing the cards, but you get the idea.&#10;&#10;To start the game, each player receives a hand of seven cards from the 110-card deck; card types are water, sand, umbrella and special. On a turn, the active player takes one sand and one water card from his hand to create mud, then hurls it at another player. (Again, not literally...) That player has a chance to defend herself by playing umbrella cards to block either the sand or water or both, or by playing special cards that, for example, redirect the mud back to the thrower or spread it out on all other players. Other players can add to someone's attack in order to make the perfect mix of mud &ndash; e.g., adding a 1-value water to a muddy mix of 5-value sand and 4-value water &ndash; and by making the perfect mix, they get to redirect the attack at any player.&#10;&#10;After the mudball hits its target or splats on someone's shield, each player refills her hand to seven cards, then the player who was hit in the previous round starts the new round by choosing a target and throwing. The game continues until the deck runs out of cards, in which case players shuffle discarded cards in order to finish the final round. Players then tally the sand and water points in front of them, and the player with the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.70315;1.0

Each player gets a set of one colour.&#10;The explosive cards show briefcases with positive values from 1-8 on one side, and bombs with negative values from 1-8 on the other side. They are shuffled and a number of explosive cards equal to the number of players plus one are laid out, positive side up. The remaining explosive cards are set aside.&#10;&#10;Players try to win as many positive explosive cards as possible. They take turns placing one of their number cards in front of one of the explosive cards. Whoever places the highest total on each explosive cards gets to take that card.&#10;&#10;Rules for card placement:&#10;&#10;     You cannot play another card directly on top of one of your own cards.&#10;     Each number can only be played once per explosive card, i.e. if another player has already played the 4 on an explosive card, you cannot play a 4 on the same explosive.&#10;     8 is an exception; there is no restriction on how many 8s can be played on one explosive card.&#10;&#10;&#10;If there are already 7 number cards on an explosive card, a player can blow it up by adding an 8th card. The explosive card is then turned from its briefcase side to the bomb side, and the player who wins it gets negative points instead.&#10;&#10;A round ends when all players have played all their cards. Card values on each explosive card are added up, with the last card in a row earning its owner an extra two points. The player with the most points in one row wins that explosive card.&#10;&#10;Players get back their number cards and a new round starts with new explosive cards.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all explosive cards are gone or there aren't enough left to start another round.&#10;Players add up the points from all their positive and negative explosive cards.

1099;Downspin;"The players have between them a screen with five knobs in it. These knobs link chutes running from the top of the game to its base. The top chutes are loaded with your coloured discs in sequence (1 through 5). On your turn, you twist one of the knobs so as to move one of your discs down. The knobs don't have the same indentations for either player, so you're never sure if you're helping the opponent or not.&#10;&#10;First one to get his discs down to the base in sequence wins. You also win if you force the opponent's discs to get to the base out of sequence. Several variants are offered in the rules.&#10;&#10;1994 Mensa Select&#10;&#10;";1970;5.51095;1.1304
1101;Flying Carpet;"A card-playing race game, where you have to avoid obstacles (placed by the players collectively at the start), maneuvering your carpet between the clouds and utilising the wind to be first to the destination.

1105;Titus;"Theme&#10;The cards show coins, possibly Roman, but this is a very abstract card game with a memory element.&#10;&#10;Goal&#10;Players try to collect as many victory points as possible by collecting series of four consecutively numbered cards.&#10;&#10;Game play&#10;The 54 coin cards have values from 1 to 19 printed on both sides. The value on one side differs from that of the other side by a maximum of two.&#10;The goal of the game is to collect series of four coins with consecutive values (e.g. 1-2-3-4 or 9-10-11-12). Series of four are exchanged for victory point cards. There are 12 victory point cards with values from 18 to 7. The first player to collect a series gets the 18-point victory card, the next series is worth 17 points and so on, so the sooner you complete series, the better.&#10;&#10;On his/her turn, a player has the following choices:&#10;&#10;     They can take the top card from the draw deck and use it in their own card display.&#10;     They can give the top card from the draw deck to one of the other players and get a single (i.e. not part of a series) card from that player's display. Before they can add it to their own display, they have to turn the card over, so its value can be up to two points lower or higher than what they originally saw.&#10;     They can take the top card from a completed series for which another player has already scored points. That card has to be turned over and used with its other side up too.&#10;&#10;&#10;If a player manages to incorporate a card into his/her card display, they get another turn (limit: 3 consecutive turns). There is no limit on how many rows a player can start in his/her display.&#10;&#10;The game ends when there are no cards left in the draw deck.&#10;The player with the most victory points wins the game.&#10;&#10;";2000;5.21236;1.6

1111;Taboo;"In the party game Taboo, you're trying to give clues to your teammates so that they'll guess a particular word, but you can't say just anything you like. Some clues are off limits!&#10;&#10;When you're the active player, hold the deck of cards so that you and the opposing team can see the top card. At the top of the card is the word your teammate must say to score the card, and you can anything you want to help them figure out what to guess other than the word itself (duh!) or the five words/phrases listed on the bottom of the card.&#10;&#10;For example, can you get your teammates to say &quot;bacon&quot; without saying &quot;pig&quot;, &quot;eggs&quot;, &quot;breakfast&quot;, &quot;sausage&quot;, or &quot;eat&quot;? If you do, you score the card, then move on to the next card, trying to guess as many cards as possible before time runs out. However, if you say a taboo word (or make gestures), the opposing team will buzz a buzzer and score the card themselves.&#10;&#10;How well can you describe things without breaking the taboo?&#10;&#10;";1989;6.30988;1.2063
1115;Poker;"Poker is played with a standard deck of 52-cards, and sometimes Jokers are added as wild cards. The object of the game is to win the pot which contains all the bets the players have made in a deal.  Players are dealt cards which are usually reduced to a Poker hand of five (5) cards. Betting and bluffing are used in rounds until all bets are squared up, or until all other players have conceded the pot (folded). If all bets have been squared up, the rounds are followed by a &quot;showdown&quot; in which all hands are fully revealed; the one with the best combination of a Poker hand of five (5) cards being the winner.&#10;&#10;The following table describes and ranks the standard Poker hands:&#10;&#10;Five of a Kind (Only if wild cards are in use):  Four cards of the same rank and one wild card (eg: A, A, A, A, Joker).&#10;Straight Flush: A straight with all cards of the same suit (eg: A, K, Q, J, 10: all spades). (The highest Straight Flush is nominally called a Royal Flush)&#10;Four of a Kind:  Four cards of the same rank (eg: A, A, A, A, K).&#10;Full House:  Three of a kind in one rank and a pair in a different rank (eg: A, A, A, K, K). &#10;Flush:  Five cards of the same suit (eg: A, K, Q, J, 9: all spades)&#10;Straight:  Five cards in sequence of rank (eg: A, K, Q, J, 10).&#10;Three of a Kind:  Three cards of the same rank (eg: A, A, A, K, Q).&#10;Two Pair:  Two pairs of different ranks (eg: A, A, K, K, Q).&#10;One Pair:  A pair of cards of the same rank (eg: A, A, K, Q, J).&#10;High Card:  High card without any other higher combination (eg: A, K, Q, J, 9).&#10;&#10;";1810;6.71161;2.4309
1117;You're Bluffing!;"Classic bidding and bluffing game. The deck consists of sets of farm animals, 4 cards per animal. Players auction off the top animal of the deck, or try to complete their set by trading with another player. Highest bid wins, but auctioneer always has the choice to buy the animal for the same price as the highest bid.&#10;Trading is a blind bidding system: both players place their bid face down on the table and reveal them simultaneously to each other. High bidder gets the other player's animal. Both players swap their bid. It's best to bid just a little bit more than your opponent, but just how much did he bid?&#10;&#10;reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;Kuhhandel Master (2009)&#10;&#10;";1985;6.58203;1.6261
1125;Big Shot;"Big Shot is an auction game in which a set of colored cubes is put up for auction each round based on a random die roll. Whoever wins the bid, places those cubes in areas on the game board. Once an area has seven cubes in it, that area is locked and no more cubes can be added. Whoever has the majority of cubes in that area owns it &mdash; except that ties for majority are disregarded, so in a spread of 3/3/1 cubes, the player with only one cube owns that area!&#10;&#10;Players have a limited amount of money with which to bid. They can take one loan each turn, but the first loan gives them only $9 more, while the second loan gives them $8 and the third $7. At the end of the game, the player must repay $10 for each loan taken, with that money coming from the value of the property they now own.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players tally the value of what they own (with some properties being doubled in value if the player owns that region's doubler as well as areas within that region), then repay all loans. Whoever has the most money wins!&#10;&#10;";2001;6.88964;1.9787
1127;Encounters;"Encounters is a light, &quot;take that&quot; sort of card game with a  D&amp;D / fantasy theme.  The game features a deck of cards consisting of heroes, monsters, weapons and treasure.  Each player starts the game with a party of adventurers (hero cards) on their side (think clerics, fighters, elves, etc.).  During your turn you draw two cards and play two cards, allowing you to perform actions like sending monsters to fight other players, equipping your heroes with weapons, or placing acquired treasure in your personal vault.  A simple combat system is used to resolve monster attacks (which can kill your heroes), and then play passes to the next player.&#10;&#10;Adding some complexity and theme are a number of special ability rules that apply to the different heroes and monsters, such as spells, turning undead,  armor abilities, fiery breath, etc.  When only one player has heroes left standing, that player gets a gold bonus and the round ends.  The cards are collected and a new round begins!  Rinse and repeat until the winning player reaches a certain level of accumulated wealth.&#10;&#10;Re-issued as a CCG with more cards in 1995 under the name Fantasy Adventures.&#10;&#10;";1982;5.892;1.6667
1129;Archimedes;"This is a strategy game for 2-3 players. It takes place on a 6 sided game board with pieces moving on the triangles. Each player has 4 pawns in the form of dice. The triangular fields of the board are molded so that a corner of a die exactly fits in. The die can be moved from space to space with a simple nudge at the top.&#10;&#10;Object of the game is to get your 4 dice across the board.&#10;&#10;PREPARATION FOR THE GAME WITH TWO ? The younger player chooses a color and puts his 4 dice into four edge spaces of his side of the board.&#10;&#10;WHAT DOES A TURN CONSIST OF?&#10;&#10;1.) Each turn must be executed completely. One might not skip a part of the turn. You may not move a die less than its actual movement unless you reach the finish without completing your die roll  &#10;2.)   Dice may not touch. So a die will block 3 spaces. (2 spaces if on an edge.)&#10;3.)   If a player has no legal move, he skips his turn.&#10;&#10;GAME RULES FOR THREE PLAYERS All rules of the normal game for two persons are valid also for the game with three. &#10;Additionally you must follow these rules: 1.) Set up is different .

1133;Organized Crime;"The object of the game is to be the ONLY surviving player.  A player is removed from the game when his Boss is rubbed-out.  Much of the game involves moving Hit-Men about a circular board in an attempt to build up your influence via corrupt politicians, illegal activities and business investments.  Occasionally, Hit-Men can be penalized for making mistakes (cards are drawn and effects are carried out), sometimes attempts at rubbing out mob bosses may occur.  There are also opportunities for negotiation &aacute; la:  &quot;If you help me with a vote of support, I will pay for the next business venture you land on.&quot;  Cards, money and promises are all possible bargaining chips.

1135;Quest For Power;"Quest for Power is billed as a &quot;Game Masterless Role-Playing System&quot;. In actuality, it is a fantasy-themed board game where the board is constructed each play session from randomly dealt cards. It has all the trappings of a role-playing game: character generation, multiple races and professions, skills, spells, weapons, etc. But the actual game play is very much a board game: move along the board, turn over unexplored cards, and deal with the situation given on them. Players can compete against one another, or work cooperatively. Like any good multiplayer game, there are alliances and treacherous betrayals among the players. In the end, in order to defeat the evil lord in his castle (the main objective of the game) at least some of the players will need to team up because the castle lord is more powerful than any one character can handle.&#10;&#10;Evidently the publisher had visions of making a whole series of games based on the R.A.G.G.S. (Random Adventure Game Generating System). The sub-title for the game is &quot;Darkness in the Light&quot; and it is called a &quot;Starter Set for Character Levels 1 - 3&quot;, presumably because other scenarios and rules for higher level characters were planned. As far as I know, no expansions for the game were ever produced and Infinite Imagination, Inc. is no more.&#10;&#10;";1997;3.125;2.0

1139;Fantastische Ballonreise;"Fantastische Ballonreise [Fantastic Balloon Voyage] is a dice game for 2-5 players. The idea is to fly as quickly as possible. Whoever can land at his destination first wins. Fantastische Ballonreise will take you flying all over Germany and its neighbors following a &quot;must visit&quot; list set at the start of the game. At the various stops you will read a card which is descriptive of the folklore of the location and has a special effect on play, including trivia contests, drawing pictures or singing songs. This game was developed as a promotional item for the soft drink manufacturer Fanta. Includes five miniature plastic balloons which go up and down on stands to show their current altitude. Players race their balloons, and special dice are used to determine the change of orientation of a large wind rose, which indicates the amount of movement permitted in each direction, but lines on the board indicate which directions can be travelled in from each space. Cards are dealt out to indicate start position, end position and four intermediate points in each player's route. Very nice item.&#10;&#10;";1977;3.5;0.0

But a throw is also a &quot;to-hit&quot; roll which may go into another's balloon and force it downwards. In addition, it may hit a crewmember, knocking them out yet causing the target balloon to once again rise.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.1;0.0
1143;Warrior Knights;"Players vie against each other to take over as many cities on the map as they can.  The player who controls more than half of the un-razed cities of the kingdom wins.  Warrior Knights is a game where players use armies to conquer cities and rout opposing forces.  Cities provide income which pays for armies and city improvements.  The interesting aspect of the game, though, is the Assembly where players vote on various motions drawn from the deck of Assembly cards.  These motions are mainly for titles and appointments such as governors, ambassadors and other offices which give the holder additional troops, or for concessions which create additional income for the holder.  As in any game of this nature, alliances are forged and broken between players in order to further goals until one player emerges victorious.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Warrior Knights&#10;&#10;&#10;";1985;6.62575;3.2203

Dragon Strike takes the HeroQuest game play and goes a step further in a few directions:&#10;&#10;1) The Wizard and Elf have more spells at their disposal and a greater variety to choose from,&#10;&#10;2) Dragon Strike comes with 4 different game boards (vs. HeroQuest's single board), one of which is outdoors,&#10;&#10;3) a slightly more advanced combat system which uses different polyhedral dice (instead of all six-siders) and has concepts like flying creatures which can only be hit with spells and missile weapons, and&#10;&#10;4) a (cheezy) 30 minute VHS video tape which introduces players to the game and sets the &quot;mood&quot; for playing.&#10;&#10;";1993;6.37611;2.3091

1155;Capitol;"&quot;Architects of the Eternal City&quot;.&#10;&#10;Rivalry in old Rome for the most spectacular buildings and dominance in the Roman prefectures. Whoever uses the 90 blocks and 40 roofs best will win. There are four rounds to a game: Each round has a building phase, an auction phase, a scoring phase and a card drawing phase. In the building phase, players decide on the height of the buildings and build them at the side of the board; if they have the necessary permit, they can build on the board itself. A building is finished when it has a roof; the first roof in a prefecture determines the shape of all other roofs. In the auction phase players can auction for temples, wells and amphitheaters, earning extra points. This is a beautiful production.&#10;&#10;This game by Alan R. Moon and Aaron Weissblum is a mix of territory acquisition, resource management and even a little auctioning thrown in for good measure.

Now movie cards can change hands.&#10;&#10;Debts and bankruptcy&#10;If a player must pay a sum and no longer has sufficient cash, he must sell his movie cards and/or Golden Suns. The player chooses what he would like to sell. The bank pays the sums printed on the cards, and Golden Suns fetch the same amount. Sold movie cards are turned face down again, and the screens and Golden Suns go back to the reserve. How-ever, the bank only takes back cards and Golden Suns if a player is insolvent.&#10;&#10;A player who cannot settle his debts must declare bankruptcy. He gives all his remaining cash, miniature screens and Golden Suns back to the bank. The movie cards are turned face down again. The player retires from the game. If movie cards are turned face down in the second game phase, the game returns to the first game phase. Therefore, takeovers of movie cards that belong to other players cannot take place.&#10;&#10;Negotiations &#10;All players are allowed to negotiate with other players anytime, even if it is not their turn. Movie cards may be bought, sold or traded. Players can also negotiate in order to pay debts. They need not necessarily sell to the bank if they receive better purchase offers from players.  Players can also negotiate whether owed sums on opponents&rsquo; movie cards can be reduced or even free of charge.&#10;&#10;Ending the game&#10;The game is over when only one player remains. He is king of Hollywood!&#10;&#10;&#10;";1979;3.42855;1.0
1177;Die Ritter von der Haselnuss;"Publisher summary (user edited): Die Ritter von der Haselnuss is a memory game, where the squirrel has to collect and store nuts for the winter.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: The player whose turn it is throws a die and moves the squirrel knight according to the number shown - but he can chose which way on the board he moves. If a player lands on a bush he can pick up a card - will he get a nut or does the bush hide a fox or some other animal? With a good memory the players can protect themselves from the nut thief ... otherwise they will lose all the nuts they have collected.&#10;&#10;Die Ritter von der Haselnuss is a game suitable for the youngest players in the family, with easy rules and short playing time.&#10;&#10;";1996;5.89227;1.1
1179;Tendix;"PROCESS OF GAME&#10;The player whose turn it is draws one tile from the bag and places it on any free space.&#10;The colour on top is decisive for the effect of the tile. All tiles in the distance that corresponds to the colour (straight line) are turned upside down. Diagonal distances do not count here. Violet (zero) up means of course that nothing is turned. Only a just placed tile can have an effect, there are no chain reactions.&#10;Example: If I lay down a tile with orange up, all tiles that are exactly two spaces away from that tile are turned around, but not those who are one or more than two spaces away. The games lasts until all tiles are placed and the board is completed.&#10;&#10;from the rules translation&#10;OBJECT OF THE GAME&#10;At the end of the game every player counts separately the number of tiles showing his two colours on the top. Now he subtracts the lower number from the higher one. That is his final result.&#10;Example: With red and green as my colors, eight red tiles are tying up and three green ones. Thus I have five points.&#10;If the final result, of two players is the same, the player with more tiles up (sum of the two colours) wins the game.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.5625;2.0

1183;Walkabout;"A hike in the Australian Outback&#10;&#10;Players must construct the landscape. Roll out the board and place the bits on the board. Advanced players may add other objects, like dry moss, other animals, or stranger things.&#10;&#10;Each player projects themselves into the game board in a spot. He imagines himself in that position at a certain facing. The object is to report his position on the board.&#10;&#10;He does not speak but instead draws a sketch of what he sees on the notepad. The sketch is marked with his name.&#10;&#10;The sketches are all then turned up. Each player takes the little maps of the game board and locates each player on the map. Also draw an arrow to indicate the facing.&#10;&#10;Speed is good. The first player to slap his guess face down gets bonus points.&#10;&#10;";1996;5.9375;0.0
1185;Casablanca;"Players move around the board, trying to reach a symbol that corresponds with the symbol on the currently revealed card. If a player reaches that symbol, he gains the card. The bigger the amount of cards with the same symbol the player has, the more money is gained.&#10;&#10;The twist: movement is done by selecting chit, checking the back for a number, and moving however far you want to move, without revealing the actual number to the opponents. The opponents then have to accept your move or challenge the number on your chit.&#10;&#10;If they challenge the number, the player may either confess to cheating and pay a nominal fine or start a poker like bidding system in which the challenger must match his bid before he can see the chit.&#10;&#10;";1977;5.18421;1.5
1187;The Fellowship of the Ring;"The Fellowship of the Ring is a wargame centered on the action of the first book of the Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien.  One player plays the Fellowship, deploying Heroes in an attempt to misdirect and deceive the other player, who plays Sauron with control of the evil Nazg&ucirc;l and Balrog. It takes many of the ideas from the character game of SPI&rsquo;s War of the Ring and expands upon them.&#10;&#10;";1983;6.1998;3.5745
1189;The King's War: The First English Civil War 1642-1646;"A strategic game about the English Civil War.&#10;&#10;This game uses a point-to point system for movement. The counters represent infantry and cavalry regiments of resp. 1000 foot and 700 horse. The leader counters represent leaders of both factions, each leader has its own unique ratings for seniority, army handling, movement and tactical skills.&#10;&#10;The map shows Wales, England and a small part of Scotland.&#10;Aim of the game is to force the other side below 50 Victory Points. This can be done by conquering certain key cities and the counties.&#10;Sequence of play is easy and only contains 3 separate phases: Movement (incl. interceptions, break contact, combat and training of units), Siege and the Desertion &amp; Recruitment phase.&#10;&#10;";1989;7.09682;3.4
1191;Card Caper;"Each player is dealt a Hidden Card to begin.  The object is to accumulate points by deducing the opponents' Hidden Card as quickly as possible.  Next, each player is dealt an equal portion of the remaining deck, and must give information to the opponents; s/he must lay down a card of Higher Value, Lower Value, Different Value, and Different Suit.  Players are given notepads in the style of Clue to make notes about what cards are played, and what can't be the Hidden Card of each player. Then, each player takes it in turn to roll the die, and either reveal more information, or guess at the identity of an opponents' card.  Wrong guesses give no penalty, so you may as well try.  If you're right, you get one point for each card remaining in that player's hand.  This creates reverse suspense: players race to be first, because cards are dropped each round, and five points for last with a Hidden Card unguessed isn't enough to overcome someone who nailed two Hidden Cards early on.  After everyone has revealed their card, whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;";1997;4.88646;1.0
1193;The Bottom Line;"The idea of The Bottom Line is to accumulate $5,000,000 and land on the Bank, so as to buy it.  Not as easy as it sounds.  You have $1,000,000 cash, $2,000,000 in debt and 2000 oz. of gold to begin. There are several different businesses, and you can buy parts of them for anywhere from $100,000 each for Residentials, to $600,000 for Casinos.  When someone lands on a property you own, you get $50,000 per property of the same kind you own.  But the big money comes when you collect a full set of property.  Land on a Drive-in Realtor and you can collect multiple millions for selling your set.  There are also Options, which allow you to buy lots from your opponents at nauseatingly low prices, and gold is bought for $600,000 a brick (or in that area) and sells for over $1 million.  Gold seems to be the fast way to money, but you must have the appropriate card, or you'll get fined $100,000.  As players get out of debt (or deeper in it), they will find themselves in a die-rolling race to land on the Bank, or square 17, which allows you to go anywhere you want.  A good finance game, but it was only printed for a year in America. Copies do pop up on eBay (where I got mine).&#10;&#10;";1985;5.50481;1.8333
1195;Cloudbusters;"A wargame set on a world where only high plateaus are habitable. The only way that people can get around is by airships. Each players starts with a small fleet of airships on a plateau in the corner of the map, and attempts to expand and conquer as many other plateaus as possible. Each captured plateau provides additional income (used for building more airships, and possibly also for buying extra movement dice) and a special ability token.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.33333;2.0
1197;Blink;"The two-minute-long, two-player card game Blink bills itself as the fastest game in the world. Without taking turns, players race to empty their hands by matching the color, shape, or number of symbols on their cards in hand to the top card of the two discard piles in the center of the table. As soon as a player lays down one card, they can draw another, up to the hand size of three cards. If both players can't play, they can both draw a card directly onto the discard pile at the same time and then continue play. The first player to empty their hand and draw pile wins.&#10;&#10;The rulebook includes variants for three- and four-player games.&#10;&#10;Blink: Bible Edition is the same game with Christian faith icons.&#10;&#10;";1995;5.94543;1.0656

The wizards are all different, being small, medium or large, and having different coloured shoes, cloaks, hats, and spells.&#10;&#10;Twelve cards are placed face up in the centre of the table, along with the face-down deck. One player turns over the card on top of the deck. All players now try to identify a card from the table which has nothing in common with the new card.&#10;&#10;";1998;4.94971;1.0

1203;Witch Trial;"Players represent lawyers in this humorous, pseudo-Colonial courtroom trial card game.&#10;&#10;Each player attempts to prosecute victims and make money by winning the case. All lawyers pair a Suspect with a Charge card to represent the case they are prosecuting. However, money can also be made by defending the cases that other lawyers are working on. When a case comes to court, players add their Evidence cards, and make Motions and Objections, in order to sway the jury to their side. Then the case is either settled by plea bargain (an agreement by lawers to divide the case money) or by the jury (a 2D6 dice roll of 13 or more which includes all card modifiers played on this case). A fun game in which the lawyer with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Awards&#10;    2001 Origins Award Nominee: Best Abstract Board Game&#10;    2001 Listed in GAMES Magazine's GAMES 100&#10;&#10;&#10;";2001;6.24041;1.6957
1205;Luxor;"Players try to excavate the most valuable mummies from the pyramids by placing tiles into the vertical board.  Each match allows the player to manuver their explorers around the pillars.

1207;Big Deal;"Big Deal is a game of corporate business deals. Players are big investors (and I mean big - the smallest notes are $50 million and billions of dollars change hands) and wheeler-dealers.&#10;&#10;Players acquire shares in companies, primarily randomly (picked up as cards), but also possibly through purchase of other players' previous sales. To form the companies they must also acquire resources, which are bought from 4 sets. The pricing mechanism for these is like Palmyra and McMulti - each purchase increases the price and each sale decreases it. Once an appropriate set is acquired for a matching set of (at least two) shares in a company, the company can be formed. Companies pay income to their owners each turn. They can also be sold off at a premium, or split up (provided the owner has enough shares and resources) to gain double income. The real heart of the game comes in the option to conduct hostile takeovers. A player lays one or more shares in a company owned by another player and then starts a bidding war to takeover the company. Each player is bidding to buy the shares of the opponent (bids are per share). The &quot;winner&quot; gets the company and all the shares, the &quot;loser&quot; is paid off at the final bid price. Who is actually the winner and loser depends, of course, on the balance of the final price.&#10;&#10;There is a sudden death variable finish, when assets plummet in value, so there is a tense few final rounds when players can try to realize assets while they are still valuable. During this period the judgment of takeover prices becomes even more tricky (and a gamble).&#10;&#10;";2001;5.55558;3.0
1209;Pax Britannica: The Colonial Era 1880 to the Great War;"Pax Britannica is a Victorian Era multi player wargame of empire, diplomacy, and global confrontation. The Great Powers of United Kingdom, France, the US, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy, Russia, and Japan vie throughout the world for the wealth and esteem conferred by vast colonial holdings in the far-flung corners of the Earth. Each player maneuvers his administrative and military assets to establish control over the choicest and most strategic areas, keeping a wary eye toward encroaching opponents whose colonial ambitions are every bit as great. Conflict between national wills is more often resolved through peaceful negotiation than through war; but when national honor is too severely tried, war can occur- on a scale that threatens to evolve into the War to End All Wars!&#10;&#10;Time scale = 4 years per turn; Map scale = abstract; Unit scale = Corps/Fleet, Division/Task Force, Regiment/Squadron; Playing time = approx 4 to 7 hours.&#10;&#10;";1985;6.74813;3.8529

There are two sets of cards showing ten objects, a camera, a ball, a coconut etc. Select 7 objects, lay one deck out for all to see, shuffle the other deck and draw one randomly and hide it. Then deal the remaining six cards face up very quickly and cover the last with your hand. Players must now determine which card was removed. Think it's easy? No it's not!

1217;The Secret Labyrinth;"Part of the Ravensburger Labyrinth Games series, it's Labyrinth transposed in a circular format, and with a rock-paper-scissors &quot;combat&quot; system added.

The first player who captures (or steals from another player) seven treasures or seven trolls wins the game.&#10;&#10;";1998;4.78877;1.4375
1219;Labyrinth;"Labyrinth (formerly The aMAZEing Labyrinth) has spawned a whole line of Labyrinth games. The game board has a set of tiles fixed solidly onto it; the remaining tiles that make up the labyrinth slide in and out of the rows created by the tiles that are locked in place. One tile always remains outside the labyrinth, and players take turns taking this extra tile and sliding it into a row of the labyrinth, moving all those tiles and pushing one out the other side of the board; this newly removed tile becomes the piece for the next player to add to the maze.&#10;&#10;Players move around the shifting paths of the labyrinth in a race to collect various treasures. Whoever collects all of his treasures first and returns to his home space wins!&#10;&#10;Labyrinth is simple at first glance and an excellent puzzle-solving game for children; it can also be played by adults using more strategy and more of a cutthroat approach.&#10;&#10;";1986;6.40908;1.3405
1221;Crossed Wires;"Six telephones are placed around the board and connected over seven hexagonal tiles through a spaghetti-like maze of wires.  A die is rolled to determine a start phone. The players follow the tangled lines with their eyes -- no fingers, please!

1223;Fat Cats;"Age 10+&#10;The players simultaneously bet on meal cards; if you bet correctly (i.e. nobody else bet on that particular meal), you move up around the table, closer to the softest cushion (and victory).  The heftier the meal, the more you advance.  Some of the meal cards have a ghost on their back; if you win one of those, you move back instead of forward.  You also have a silver platter; you can use that to send the ghost to another cat --but he'll then have the silver platter for later, and you won't...&#10;&#10;One final note: when multiple players bet on the same meal, their betting tokens remain on the card for the next betting round --this mechanic forces the implicated players to choose something else, and can signal an opportunity for the lone player to be in a position to bet on that meal...&#10;&#10;Simple and fast playing.&#10;&#10;";1993;5.32857;2.0
1225;Quest;"&quot;A family game of knights in search of the magical ring, set in the age of myths.&quot;&#10;&#10;Each of the four states of Tirad, Urgad, Galad and Elgad has one large city.  Life in a city flourishes for the inhabitants only when the magical ring is there.  Unfortunately, the ring never stays long in one place.  A band of brave knights is gathered together in Galad where they hear rumours that the ring has been seen in Tirad.  The Quest begins...&#10;&#10;Each player tries to find the ring and transport it to the cities.  As a reward, they receive the seals of these cities.  Collect three different seals to win.  Many obstacles are to be overcome and dragons slain before a knight's quest is complete.&#10;&#10;This is a fairly abstract game.  Each player has three extra &quot;lives&quot; and loses one when defeated by a dragon or when attacking another player.  These lives are replenished by visiting cities.  The ring allows its bearer some significant advantages such as passing through obstacles.  Special spots on the map allow new obstacles to be placed or existing ones to be moved, so a player can be affected even by other players far from him.  The end game can drag a bit as all the other players coordinate their efforts against the leader.&#10;&#10;";1984;5.13993;1.7857
1227;Stonewall;"Designer/Publisher's Description:&#10;&#10;The object of Stonewall is to race your opponents from your starting point to your diagonally opposite corner of a 144 square grid board and back again by the roll of the dice.  Every time you move you may place one wall piece of any length (single,double or triple)on the playing board to help your path or hinder your opponent.  Rolling a four will get you an extra turn and landing on an occupied square will send your opponent back to the start.  Once you have made it to your opposite corner on the turn you pass around it you must change one wall that has already been placed, this can be done to speed up your path home or to force an opponent to go backwards if they are winning.&#10;Stonewall has great strategy play patterns but the dice play throws the element of luck into it.  As a two player game Stonewall is very competitive yet as a four player game it is very social.  New Zealand Consumer Magazine has rated us as the top game in there December 2000 issue after having the game independently play tested,and we are now starting to sell thousands throughout New Zealand.&#10;&#10;";1996;6.12821;1.5
1231;Bandu;"Players take turns choosing blocks and giving them to each other to place on their structure.  A player may pay a certain number of 'beans' to refuse a block and it gets passed to the next player.  When a player's structure falls, they are out of the game.  Last player standing wins.&#10;&#10;Description of Bandu (1992, Milton Bradley, 2-6 players):&#10;Bandu is based upon the game of Bausack. Each player is given a base block and a number of beans. During a turn, a player chooses a wood block from a common supply and either holds a Refuse or Use auction. All player bid with their beans and the winner/loser must place the piece on their tower. If your tower falls you are out of the game. The last tower standing wins.&#10;&#10;Description of Sac Noir (Rio Grande Games, 2-8 players):&#10;There are five variations on how to play. The goal in all of them is to build a tower. The bag contains very different wooden pieces (i.e. an ashlar, an egg, a ring, a fir tree etc.) as well as a sack of beans for the &quot;auction variation&quot; of the game. Depending on the variation you choose, either each player builds his own tower or all build one together. The &quot;auction variations&quot; are the most suspenseful and surprising. One might end up spending quite some beans to avoid building an especially difficult element. Gambling and bluffing abilities are needed just as much as a feeling for statics and construction skills. It's a game with almost endless building possibilities. It's a challenge for steady hands and shaky suspense for clever tacticians.&#10;&#10;";1987;6.79668;1.2862

A category is selected for each class and the players and five letter tiles are drawn. The players have 5 minutes to come up with an example that begins with each letter for each class/category. There are also variations on the game to make it harder (like using the same letter for all five words) or to allow children to play against adults competitively with easier questions.&#10;&#10;2007 update: Now part of University Game's Bookcase Series.  The game has been updated to remove many of the esoteric categories (foreign words, spelling, authors of ______ descent).  It's now much more a test of pop culture trivial knowledge and there is no longer the option to select a category only.  One must now pick a Category and Topic (the term 'class' was removed).

1235;Yellowstone;"The eternal turning of the seasons has come full cycle once again. Spring in the hight country enters with a wash of fresh green and the warming chinook, while the show still lies deep on the mountain peaks. As the snow recedes, wild flowers of every hue splash across the lush meadows of the Northern Rockies. The small life in burrow and den creep forth, the birds sing loudly in the pines. Spring is the true beginning of the new year in the awakening wilderness of the Yellowstone.&#10;&#10;The old buck raises his head and turns his gaze to the horizon. The time has come - now to lead the herd to the summer pasture where the bounty of this land will drive away the hunger of winter past. But other animals have come forth from their dens with the spring - the coyote, grizzly bear, mountain lion, and the deadliest predator of all - Man. The natural dangers of this magnificent, rugged land loom ahead. Yet the herd, to prosper, must take to the well-worn trail, seeking to cross the migratory paths of the other grazing masses. As the young gambol and explore, every instinct of the old buck must be devoted to the trek. Without hesitation, he takes the first step toward the future.&#10;&#10;Yellowstone is a less complex game dealing with moving your herd from Winter Pasturage to Summer Pasturage back to Winter Pasturage.  Players control one of the following herds: bison, elk, sheep, or mule deer.  Along the way, you try to pick up Food Points and avoid predators.  You can move the animals in your herd a certain number of hexes in a turn; males are the fastest, females are a bit slower, babies are really slow and should be accompanied by females.  However, when you finally get back to Winter Range, you score more for babies and females than you do for males -- so you may find it necessary to sacrifice a male or two to predators.  Predators are controlled by your opponents, but you get to control them on your turn.  They are not major threats, but inducement to keep moving.  Collect those food points!  You'll need them for winter.&#10;The game's map centers on the Yellowstone Park area and some of the land south of there.&#10;&#10;";1985;5.74021;1.7812

1245;Isis & Osiris;"User Summary&#10;Each player receives the same quantity of wooden disks of a colour and a face down pile of cardboard tiles with positive and negative values.&#10;On your turn, you can either place one of your wooden disks on the gameboard, or draw one of the face down tiles, display its value to your opponents and place it face down on the gameboard.&#10;Turn by turn repeat this until the board is completely filled. Now the cardboard tiles on the board get revealed and you score each of your disks by totalling the values of the cardboard tiles that are orthogonal to your disks. Depending on the tiles the value can be positive, neutral or negative. Your score is the sum of values of all your disks.&#10;The player with the most positive points wins.&#10;&#10;From the box&#10;According to legend, Osiris brought agriculture to Egypt, the foundation of its culture. Together with Isis, he ruled the country with great wisdom until he was betrayed by his envious brother, Seth. Now Isis must search for her husband, and she punishes anyone who dares to stand in her way.&#10;&#10;New Release&#10;With same design, different size box and additional variant by Abacusspiele, 999 Games and Devir in octobre 2010.&#10;&#10;awards&#10;&#10;     Game by Game 2011, Recommendation&#10;     The Book Of Games 2002, Recommendation&#10;     Speelgoed Van Het Jaar 2001, Nomination&#10;&#10;&#10;";2001;5.83964;1.3494

1253;Limits;"A color based card game where players try to track the number of cards played in each color vs.  a limit card with maximums for each color.  Successful challenges result in points for the winner and penalties for the loser.&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;Deal each player 5 cards (show one of 5 colors), then reveal the top Limit Card. Limit Cards specify limits (0 - unlimited) for the number of allowable cards in each of the 5 colors. Players place one of their cards face down in front of them -- these will modify the limits, adding one per card played this round. In turn order, players either challenge a previous player's play, or play card(s).&#10;&#10;Challenging: may &quot;call&quot; any player's last played card. Figure out which card they played last, and count how many of those cards have been discarded. Reveal all face-down cards and add those matching that color to the limit on the Limit Card. If the total exceeds the Limit, you get +1 VP and the challenged gets -2 VP; otherwise, vice versa.&#10;&#10;After resolving a Challenge, flip discard pile face down and place under draw deck WITHOUT shuffling. Players return their Limit-modifying card to hand; reveal a new Limit card and play again (player who got the -2 VP plays first).&#10;&#10;Playing Card(s): place a card to the discard pile, then draw a card. OR, if you have a set of 4 matching cards, you may draw 2, then discard 2 of the matches and place the other 2 matches on top of the draw deck; take a +1 VP card bonus.&#10;&#10;Game ends after all Limit cards have been played; most VP wins!&#10;&#10;";2001;5.97172;1.1379
1255;Vegas;"Vegas is set in a casino with a game board that shows a series of fourteen gaming tables (made up of squares). The game includes a cut-out figure of 'Mary Chip', a 'gold' die (numbered 1 to 6), two special dueling dice, and markers/counter/cards for each player. Players try to gain control of the best tables, thereby receiving the gold chips. The highest total value of chips at game end is the winner. Endgame is controlled by the movement of 'Mary Chip' as she progresses from table to table.&#10;&#10;Maginor is a reworking of this game with some rule changes and a new theme.&#10;&#10;";1996;5.04874;1.5625
1257;Starbase Jeff;"Starbase Jeff is a pipe-laying game where players maximize their profits by strategically placing and building onto sections of a starbase.  Whoever makes the most money by the end of a given number of rounds wins the game.  Any number of rounds can be played with each round lasting approximately 20 minutes.

1261;Medina;"The year is 1822.  After years of decay, it is time to rebuild the medina, located at the foot of the Atlas mountains. The architects and engineers of the city work to erect large and beautiful palaces and to renovate the damaged city wall. As the reconstruction of the old city progresses, the city's inhabitants flock through the alleys, and the contours of the new city gradually reappear!&#10;&#10;Each turn, players must place two pieces on the board, either augmenting an existing building or starting a new building if the current building of that color is finished. Each player will claim one building of each of the four colors by the end of the game, giving one point per wooden piece attached to the building.&#10;&#10;Also, if you own the largest building of a particular color you get a bonus for that color. Finally, there are bonuses for the player who most recently connected one of their buildings to the walls, which grow from the four corners of the city.&#10;&#10;Medina is a tense game by the great designer Stefan Dorra.&#10;&#10;In 2014, Medina was re-released with new components, as well as changed and 2-player rules. See Medina (Second Edition).&#10;&#10;";2001;7.02172;2.777
1263;Knights;"Knights, a.k.a. Knatsch, is a dice game in which players attempt to capture cards to fulfill the victory conditions. Players may win by capturing four castles, capturing three castles and toppling the King, or capturing two castles and winning three tournaments.&#10;&#10;Each card displays a dice combination that must be beaten to win the card. Dice are rolled several times with the player saving good dice, throwing out sixes, and rerolling others for a better score. Special cards add a lot of flavor to the dice battles. Some special cards add an extra roll or an extra die for combat; others help you defend or attack castles.&#10;&#10;Trivia: Some editions of Coloretto have contained one (or more) &quot;Creepy Castle&quot; cards that serve as expansion cards for Knights.&#10;&#10;";2000;5.62612;1.3596
1265;Mystery Rummy: Jekyll & Hyde;"It's still rummy at heart, with multiple suits of 5 cards each, with the twist being that the suits are designated J for Jekyll, H for Hyde, or J/H for suits that count as both Jekyll and Hyde. The unique mechanism in this version of MR is that there is a two sided card (the 'identity card') on the table next to the draw deck, which has Jekyll on one side, and Hyde on the other. At the start of the game, Dr. Jekyll is showing, but this can change if a &quot;potion&quot; card is played (one of the three gavel cards, cards you can only play one of on your turn). You then flip the identity card over, and draw 2 cards from the draw deck. This is important, because you can only play melds whose suit matches the identity that is currently showing.&#10;&#10;The identity card is important in scoring as well, because any melds that match the identity card when scoring count double, and during scoring if all your meld suits match the current identity card, you shut the other player out! This makes for a tense endgame, especially if you're trying to go for a shutout, because there is a card 'transformation that can change the value of your or an opponents meld from one suit to another.&#10;&#10;Add in one more gavel card type ('work in lab') which lets you draw three cards from the draw deck and keep one, or the top of the discard pile, but only if the card you take matches the identity currently showing. The round ends when one player goes out, and scoring then occurs. Cards in your hand count as negative points.&#10;&#10;This is #3 in the Mystery Rummy series.&#10;&#10;";2001;6.63664;1.531
1267;Polar Dare!;"Race your penguins across ice floes, while avoiding the hungry polar bear. The gameboard is a 4x4 array of movable ice floes; more exactly, each one is either on the right or left of its square, and this is critical for adjacency. You split your movement points between your penguins and moving the ice floes (which is good when you can shift several carried penguins), but sometimes the die has you move the polar bear instead. He chases after penguins, sending them back to the starting area.&#10;&#10;The game has some similarities to the German game Im Reich des wei&#195;&#159;en B&#195;&#164;ren that was designed by Charles Lerue and published by Schmidt Spiele in the same year (1991).&#10;&#10;";1991;5.53254;1.2105
1269;Skip-Bo;"Each player is dealt a stockpile of 30 cards. The winner will be whoever manages to empty their stockpile first. Cards are played onto four shared building piles in numerical sequence from 1 to 12. On each turn, a player draws until they have five cards in their hand, and then plays cards from: their hand, a top card of their discard piles, or their stockpile. At the end of their turn, a player must discard onto one of their four personal discard piles. Strategy involves the organizing of cards into the discard piles, care in not setting up the next players for good plays, knowing when to play from which option, and especially the timing of playing a valuable &quot;Skip-bo&quot; wildcard.&#10;&#10;Skip-bo is based on Traditional Card Games: Spite and Malice.&#10;&#10;";1967;5.61886;1.1979
1271;Volltreffer;"Volltreffer (Bullseye) is a trick taking game with three phases. In the first phase you buy your hand of cards one at a time, until all players have 8 cards. In the second phase, each player may play melds (3 of a kind, all 5 colors, smallest sum etc.) for points. The third phase is a standard trick-taking card game where you must follow suit with each trick worth points. The winner is the player who comes closest to the target score of 66 points.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.86796;1.8
1275;221B Baker Street: The Master Detective Game;"221B Baker Street is the London address of the world's most celebrated fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes, and his dedicated companion, Dr. Watson. In this game you start at 221B and travel through the streets and alleys of London picking up clues and attempting to solve the most intriguing cases Holmes and Watson have ever faced.&#10;&#10;Each player assumes the role of Holmes and matches wits with the other players to determine who possesses the most skillful powers of deduction.  Each case is represented by a card that features a crime told in story form, a selection of probable suspects and a list of locations involved in that crime. Clues are hidden throughout London, one in each of fourteen locations. Players must collect clues from each location, noting them down on their checklists as they attempt to find the answers to the questions listed on the case card.&#10;&#10;Naturally, the crime scene will often contain vital clues, and a prudent detective always checks with the neighbors. Still, you can learn something vital almost anywhere in town.  The first player to figure out the correct answers to a particular mystery or crime, return to 221B and announce the solution, is the winner.&#10;&#10;The original 221B Baker Street Board game was created and copyrighted by American writer Jay Moriarty (dba Antler Productions) in 1975.  The Brazilian version of this game is known as Scotland Yard, not to be confused with the 1983 Spiel des Jahres winner also called Scotland Yard.&#10;&#10;";1975;6.01244;1.798

1289;All The King's Men;"This is a strategy game similar to chess.  The board is layed out like a chess board and each player sets up their men just like in chess.  Unlike chess, the board for Smess has various types of arrows printed on each square of the &quot;chess&quot; board.  Movement is determined by the direction of the arrow or arrows in the square.  The pieces are similar to chess in that the Brain is like a king in chess, Ninnies are like pawns, and Numskulls are like rooks or bishops.  This is a fun game that is much simpler than chess at first glance. However, the game will vary in difficulty depending on the skill of the opponent.  The goal is to capture your opponent's Brain.  The fact that both players can &quot;see&quot; all possible moves to and from a square can make the game harder than you'd think!  A fun game!&#10;&#10;The game was later released with medieval themed pieces under the title All the King's Men.&#10;&#10;";1970;5.73121;1.9412
1291;Input;"Input is a two player game by Milton Bradley.  Each player gets the same set of pieces, and must deploy them to eliminate the opposing side.  Each piece has a movement track printed on it, and can only move from one space to the next in the program.  Used pieces can either exit the playfield, or repeat the path.&#10;&#10;";1984;5.67365;1.8
1293;Boggle;"Boggle is a timed word game in which players have 3 minutes to find as many connected words as possible from the face up letters resting in a 16 cube grid.  When the timer runs out, players compare their lists of words and remove any words found by multiple players.  Points are then awarded for remaining words, depending on how many letters are in the word.  (In the original Boggle, all words must contain 3 or more letters to score points.)&#10;&#10;An example grid given in the French Canadian rules (of Deluxe Boggle) holds an amazing 459 words!&#10;&#10;A number of variants have been produced by Parker Brothers over time, including Big Boggle (which uses a 5&times;5 grid of letters and forces players to search for longer words).&#10;&#10;Boggle is a word dice game.&#10;&#10;";1972;6.24135;1.4568
1295;Pente;"Pente is an abstract strategy game.  Players place glass markers on intersections of a 19-by-19 grid (the same as in Go).  The object of the game is to get five of your own markers in a row (4 with more than 2 players) or capture five pairs of your opponent's pieces.  The first to do either wins.  Capturing takes place when exactly two pieces are sandwiched between pieces of the opposite color. There are multiple variations of the game for greater challenge and complexity.  The 20th anniversary edition is a deluxe version of the game with a large color game instruction book, quality game board, and six sets of different colored glass markers that allows play with up to 6 players.&#10;&#10;Other five-in-a-row games include Go-Moku and Renju (which do not feature capturing), and Ninuki-Renju (which does).&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;&#10;    5ive Straight&#10;    Take 5&#10;    5 in a Row&#10;    Go-Moku&#10;    Renju&#10;&#10;&#10;";1977;6.65741;2.0803

1299;Trivial Pursuit: Genus IV;"Each player has a circular playing piece with six pie-shaped holes. The goal of the game is to collect a pie in each color. The colors correspond to different question categories.&#10;&#10;The board consists of a circular track with spaces in seven different colors. Six of the colors correspond to question categories while the last color gives a new dice roll. Six spaces along the track are &quot;pie spaces&quot;, and from these there are &quot;spokes&quot; of track leading to the middle of the board.&#10;&#10;Players roll a die and move along the track in any direction they like. When a player stops on a color they get a question of the appropriate category. If the player answers a question correctly while on a pie space, they get a pie of that color (assuming they don't already have it). A correct answer on another square allows the player to roll again.&#10;&#10;Once the player has one pie in each color, she can move along the spokes to the middle of the board to win the game.&#10;&#10;The trivia game of general knowledge questions.

1301;Netrunner;"Netrunner is a cyberpunk-themed collectible card game.  The two players are the Corp (who wins by completing Agendas) and the Runner (who wins by infiltrating the Corp and liberating Agendas).&#10;&#10;Each side has a limited number of both actions and bits (money) to spend per turn; bits are gone once used, and actions must be spent to gain more.&#10;An important thing when evaluating the power of cards is to see the Bit per action ratio.&#10;&#10;One unique feature of this game is that the Runner physically moves on the &quot;board&quot; created by facedown Corp cards.  It has the feel of a &quot;capture the flag&quot; game, with the Runner moving in dataforts to steal Agendas from the Corp.&#10;&#10;Another unique feature is that the Cards are NOT the primary strategy of the game; in fact, players can win by simply &quot;playing with the rules&quot; itself (a concept difficult to understand if you've never played Netrunner).&#10;&#10;Both players play as both Corp and Runner in a game, one after the other, with each player's Runner going against the opponent's Corp.  A winning match provides 10 points and the loser scores points equal to the number of agenda points scored/liberated. The winner of the game is the one who has the most points in the 2 submatches.&#10;&#10;Though Netrunner is traditionally a two-player duel, there are formats that allow for more players (called &quot;The Big Sell Out&quot;).&#10;&#10;";1996;7.44651;2.9336
1303;The Squirrel Game;"A cute game for 5-10 year olds.&#10;   You are a squirrel running around the forest in a figure-eight track, picking up pine cones to bring back to your hoard (which you can enter once every lap).  The first squirrel to gather 15 pine cones in his hoard wins.  Spaces on the track give you one to three pine cones when you land on them, and the special die makes you lose your move now and then --instead, every squirrel gets a free pine cone.&#10;   The tricky part is that your wheelbarrow tips over and loses its contents whenever you exceed its capacity: six pine cones.  Every other squirrel laps the track in the opposite direction to yours, so there are plenty of squirrel encounters.  Every time you leap over another squirrel (going one way or the other), you can steal from or give to him up to three of your cones.  Therein lies all the strategy.&#10;&#10;";1987;5.3131;1.125
1305;Ulysses;"A map of the Mediterranean features cities linked by lines. Move Ulysses' ship along these lines to four secret destinations to win the game.&#10;&#10;Players accept the lead player's choice of direction or object and challenge this destination. Alternative destinations are proposed and one winner will emerge. It is important to be the lead player, as this person has a choice of actions that no other players have.&#10;&#10;";2001;6.14494;2.0833

Each player has a small board in front of themselves with all 8 characters on it. There is also a deck of cards each showing only 7 characters at a time. Flip a card and whoever calls out the missing character first gets the card. The person with the most cards when they are all gone, wins.

1309;Die Magier von Pangea;"A game with a modular board in which landtiles can be moved around on a sea, hence Pangea. There are five different tile types, for each of which there is a tribe that can produce goods there. Each player has tribes in only three types. A tile has a maximum number of inhabitants, no production takes place if there are more tribes on a tile.&#10;&#10;The game is won by obtaining amulets, these can only be bought from opposing tribes which are currently producing. Amulets increase the magical power of a player. Magic can be used create new tribes or move neutral ones around, but can also be used to move landtiles around.&#10;&#10;";2001;6.2096;2.3276
1313;1826: Railroading in France and Belgium from 1826;"1826 is an 18xx game set in France and Belgium and reflects the full period of Franco-Belgian railroading, from the origins to the present day. Both countries developed their railroad systems under close Government supervision and this is reflected in the game. The two major French nationalizations are covered, as are the post-war electrification and the introduction of high-speed rail (the TGV).&#10;&#10;1826 is a moderately complex game, designed for experienced players who are looking for something different than the usual round of 1830, 1856 and 1870. Due to the nature of the French political environment, this is not a game for extensive stock market manipulations, nor is it primarily a game of financial management. 1826 is an operationally-centered game in which technology management--getting the right trains on the right companies--is key.&#10;&#10;Companies are incrementally funded, and can buy and sell their own stock. Companies start out as five-share companies and can convert to ten-share companies upon reaching their destination. The first four train classes, including the first-generation permanent trains, have a range in hexes (2, 4, 6 or 10) rather than cities: the last two train classes, which are permanent, have a range in cities. There are two merger corporations, one of which may form relatively early (when the green tiles become available) and the other somewhat later (its first opportunity to form is when brown tiles become available).&#10;&#10;";2000;7.39317;3.8
1315;Africa;"In Africa, players take on the role of explorers in uncharted Africa. The circular playing counters are placed upside down in random locations upon the various circles of the board. Each turn the player may elect to move his explorer to a revealed location anywhere on the board, or move twice, each turn moving 0, 1, or 2 adjacent revealed spaces. The explorer may then take an action (such as reveal an unrevealed tile, or move various revealed tiles to other locations). The tiles represent trade goods (of various sets), nomads, herds of animals, gold, diamonds, and monuments. When the 11th monument is revealed, the game ends. Players tally up their points and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;This being a Knizia game, there are various methods of scoring the revealed tiles, including immediate points, delayed points, opportunity points, and end points.&#10;&#10;Awarded &quot;Best Family Game&quot; title by Games Magazine in 2002.&#10;&#10;";2001;5.99858;1.7664
1317;Auf falscher FÃ¤hrte;"The title means &quot;On the wrong track&quot; and, in this trick-taking game, that's just where you can find yourself.  Players compete to take either the most or the fewest tricks, depending on the total value of a few hidden cards played at the beginning of each hand.  Problem is, however, players aren't sure whether most or least is good until after all 4 cards are revealed...&#10;&#10;";2001;6.75026;1.3333
1319;Magic Hill;"The players are wizards who control five goblins each. Each wizard is trying to be the first to get one of his goblins to the top of the magic mountain. This is done through card play. Two or three numbered cards may be played per turn. The first card determines which goblin moves. The second/third cards determine how far the goblin moves. Goblins ascend the five-tier, 3-D board by landing on top of another goblin. There are also special event tiles that can help or hinder players, and magic stones, which can increase the number of cards in a player's hand.&#10;&#10;";2001;5.95437;1.5625
1321;Catch the Match;"A pattern recognition game. There are 15 large, sturdy cards depicting an array of various objects such as kites, balls, pencils, fish, etc. Each card shows the same 15 objects, but the objects are all different colors and are in different locations. Any two cards always have one and only one object that is identical. Be the first to find this object!&#10;&#10;";1995;6.1096;1.0

1325;Wild Pirates;"A children's trick-taking card game of racing pirate ships around a series of islands to reach the treasure.  The card play is straightforward with four suits, called trump, and following lead suit.  The number of tricks won determines how many spaces a ship moves, but certain spaces move your ship forward or backward, limit your movement, or force you to take the long way around an island; therefore, there are times when you may not want to win as many tricks as you would be able.  Landing on an opponent's ship sends them back to the closest harbor.  The first ship to land on the treasure wins!&#10;&#10;";1989;5.59144;1.25
1329;Hyle;"Hyle (or Entropy) is played on a board with 5x5 spaces. During each round one player (Chaos) randomly draws and places colored wooden disks on a vinyl/cloth map. After a disk is placed, the other player (Order) may move any disk on the grid horizontally or vertically in order to form palindromes (sequences of colors that run the same forward as backward, for example, red/blue/yellow/blue/red).&#10;&#10;The game is played over two rounds (so that each player assumes each role once) and points are awarded to Order equal to the length of the palindromes formed: blue/blue=2 points, blue/red/blue=3 points, etc. (Note that blue/blue/blue is worth 7 points because it contains two 2-point palindromes and one 3-point palindrome.)&#10;&#10;Hyle 7 is the same game on a 7x7 grid instead of 5x5.&#10;&#10;";1979;6.85123;2.8667
1331;Showdown Yahtzee;"Yahtzee meets a board game.  Players move pawns around a board with 12 open spaces and 4 'wild' spaces.  If you land on an open space, you can try to complete one of the 12 standard Yahtzee combinations (not counting the 'Yahtzee' -- more on that later).  If successful, you place the card for that combination on the space and a certain number of your chips to signify ownership.  If another player lands on that space later, they have to match or beat your roll to steal ownership of the board space.  Once a combination has been assigned to a space, it stays there -- so the number of combinations available to fill a blank space on the board decreases throughout the game.  If a player lands on a 'Wild' space, they can try for any combination, then move their piece to the appropriate space and steal ownership.  Also, if a player gets a Yahtzee, they can ignore the space they're on and claim ownership of any space on the board.  Once all combinations have been claimed, each player gets one more turn in which they're allowed to keep playing as long as they keep stealing ownership of a card.  Whoever has the most chips on the board at the end of the game wins.  A very interesting twist on the classic Yahtzee mechanism.&#10;&#10;";1991;5.80561;1.2667
1333;Boom-O;"Boom-O is a simple elimination card game from the makers of Uno. Each player gets 7 cards in hand and three time bomb cards in front of them. Most of the cards in the deck either increase or decrease the timer total. Other cards include familiar commands such as Skip, Reverse, Draw 1 (or 2) and Trade Hands. Player discard one card per turn trying to clear their hand while keeping the timer total under 60. If a player can't play a valid card, they must flip over one of their three time bombs. If a player clears their hand, all other players flip one of their time bombs. Whoever flips all three of their bombs is out of the game. Survivor wins.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;5 Alive&#10;&#10;";2000;5.38297;1.16
1335;Gnadenlos!;"Gnadenlos! (Merciless!) is a game in which players enter a prospecting boom town and try to accumulate the most prestige points. Rather than doing the dirty work themselves, players hire adventurers to pan for their gold, fight their gun battles, and sit in for them in the poker games. Since the money hasn't yet come in, these rough-tough folk are hired merely with pieces of paper - IOUs. But on pay day the IOUs come due, and if a player can't pay off debts, then the vultures swoop in.&#10;&#10;Players bid for adventurer cards that will be used in various events - Gold Fever, High Noon, and the Poker Game. Each adventurer carries a number (a rating) for each of the three events. When it's time to play out an event, players place an adventurer card face down. All players simultaneously turn the cards over. The adventurer with the highest number pertaining to the event wins; the lowest loses (ties are usually kept as ties, with both receiving the benefits or penalties). In Gold Fever the winner and second highest receive gold, which may be exchanged for prestige points or used to pay off debts. In High Noon, the winner gets to pick back up two IOUs (not necessarily his or her own); the loser is shot and loses the adventurer card. Also the undertaker advances one space along a timing track. In the Poker Game, the winner moves forward on the prestige track; the loser moves backwards. The IOU cards used in bids for the adventurers are placed in rows along the board, each beside one of six dice symbols (showing 1 through 6). When as many rows as there are players in the game are filled, it's Pay Day. A die is rolled and the outermost card beside the corresponding die symbol is turned up. The player who owns that IOU must pay up. This continues until either all cards of one die symbol have been turned up, or a player cannot meet a debt. The unfortunate player in this case gets a vulture chip and moves back 5 spaces on the prestige track. The game ends either when one player has 3 vulture chips; a player reaches or passes the winning space on the prestige track; or the undertaker reaches his final space. When the game ends the player farthest along the prestige track wins.&#10;&#10;";2001;5.91477;1.925
1337;Kuba;"Similar to Abalone, Traboulet has marbles to be pushed singly or in rows along an open 7x7 grid of holes. Each player has two clusters of four marbles each in opposite corners. Thirteen red neutral marbles in diamond shape start in the center of the grid. Players can push on any open end of their marbles to push the neutral or opposing marbles off the edge. Every time a player pushes a marble off the edge, they get to move again. First player to push off 7 red marbles or all of his opponent's movable marbles wins.&#10;&#10;";1994;6.25622;1.9
1339;Dungeon!;"In many ways &quot;Dungeon!&quot; is similar to Dungeons &amp; Dragons, although much simplified and transformed into a board game. Players explore a dungeon that is divided into levels of increasing difficulty, fighting monsters for valuable treasure. As players venture deeper into the dungeon, the monsters become more difficult and the treasure more valuable. Several character classes each have slightly different fighting abilities &ndash; most notably the wizard, who can cast spells. Combat is simulated using dice; players roll the dice to attack a monster, and if unsuccessful, the dice are rolled to determine the effect of the monster's counter-attack.&#10;&#10;The winner is the first player to bring a certain amount of treasure back to the Dungeon's entrance.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Classic Dungeon&#10;    The New Dungeon&#10;&#10;&#10;";1975;5.99413;1.5548

1347;Simple GBoH;"A significant simplification of GMT's popular Great Battles of History series, this is a set of rules that allows you to play scenarios from many of the various GBOH games and their expansion modules. Many of the more fiddly aspects of the system have been dramatically simplified (shock combat, missile combat, orderly withdrawal, elephants, leader activation), or eliminated entirely (rout/rally, individual orders, strategy ratings, momentum, trumping). The rules for SGBOH are the same across all the GBOH settings, so there is no problem moving from game to game. Scenarios also play much faster, from 1-3 hours instead of the old 4 hrs and up. Scenarios provided list approximate playing times as well as balance assessments for all the scenarios (of 53 scenarios, 11 are rated as &quot;even&quot;).&#10;&#10;Note that this is not a standalone game; ownership of at least one GBOH title is required.&#10;&#10;Games that only require SGBOH rules (have SGBOH scenarios and game-specific rules included)&#10;- Chandragupta&#10;- Chariots of Fire&#10;- Devil&#039;s Horsemen&#10;- Hoplite&#10;&#10;Games requiring SGBOH playbook&#10;- Alexander&#10;- SPQR&#10;- Caesar: The Civil Wars&#10;- Caesar: Conquest of Gaul&#10;- Cataphract&#10;&#10;Games requiring SGBOH battle manual&#10;- Many C3i scenarios from above&#10;&#10;Games that are not supported by SGBOH&#10;- Ran&#10;- Samurai&#10;- Lion of the North&#10;- War Galley&#10;- Caesar in Alexandria - but it is very SGBOH-like apparently&#10;- Siege of Alesia&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;- Simple Great Battles of History Rules (Nov. 2004 edition has updates for several scenarios)&#10;- Simple Great Battles of History Charts&#10;- Simple Great Battles of History Playbook containing SGBOH scenarios for Alexander, SPQR, Julius Caesar, Conquest of Gaul and Cataphract.&#10;&#10;In March, 2017 GMT released a new Second Edition of Simple GBoH.&#10;&#10;";2000;7.51605;2.9211

1351;Legend of Heroes;"From the back of the box -&#10;&#10;In a far land there is a Legend, as old as time itself.&#10;The Legend tells of a green mountain...of an ancient dungeon labyrinth buried deep beneath it...and of the priceless treasures to be found there. It also tells of the fearsome monsters and deadly traps which await all who seek those riches, and how only the boldest and most resourceful of Heroes can ever hope to enter the dungeon...and return alive!&#10;&#10;In the Starter Game, players take the parts of heroic warriors venturing alone into the labyrinth in search of fame and wealth. Great are the rewards, but great also are the dangers to be face along the way. In the Expanded Game, the warriors are joined by other heroic adventurers - magic-users, rogues, clerics and dwarves - as each player now pits a group of Heroes against the perils of the dungeon.

1353;Time's Up!;"Time's Up! is a charades-based party game for teams of two or more players (and is best with teams of two). Before the game begins, each player looks at several cards featuring famous historical or fictional characters and chooses some of them. Each player's cards are shuffled to form a deck, and this deck of famous names is used for each of the game's three rounds.&#10;&#10;In each round, team members take turns trying to get their teammates to guess as many names as possible in 30 seconds. In round 1, almost any kind of clue is allowed, and the cluegiver cannot pass on a card. In round 2, no more than one word can be used in each clue (but unlimited sounds and gestures are permitted); the cluegiver can pass on any card he likes, and the teammates can give only a single answer. In round 3, the cluegiver can use no words at all and can pass as often as he likes; again, teammates are allowed only a single guess. Give good physical clues in round 1, and they'll pay dividends down the road when you need to keep your mouth shut and gesture like a maniac before time's up!&#10;&#10;Time's Up! is based on the public domain game known as Celebrities.

1365;Olix;"Olix is a 2-player abstract strategy game.&#10;&#10;Each player places one piece on the board each turn. Once placed, pieces are never moved nor captured. The board is a simple 11 by 11 square grid.&#10;&#10;The players are attempting to form the largest formation in each of the four different types:&#10;&#10;    O = A rectangle occupying all exterior spaces of the rectangle (meaning there can be a hole or even filled with a friendly or opposing piece).&#10;    L = An L shaped formation (horizontal and vertical - not diagonal) with each leg having at least 3 spaces.&#10;    I = Any horizontal or vertical line of spaces of at least four spaces long.&#10;    X = Any diagonal line of at least four spaces long.&#10;&#10;&#10;Adjacent to the board is a scoreboard showing the lowest possible values for each formation:&#10;&#10;    O = 4, 6, 8, 9&#10;    L = 5, 6, 7, 8&#10;    I = 4, 5, 6, 7 &#10;    X = 4, 5, 6, 7 &#10;&#10;&#10;The player with the largest O, L, I, or X, marks its value on the scoreboard. If both players are tied for the largest formation of a type, both mark their scores on the scoreboard.&#10;&#10;The game ends when either player has an automatic win or when they concede that no further higher scoring formations can be made. The board should be about 66% full at this point and there simply won't be room for any higher scoring formations to be placed. The winner is the first player to form a formation larger than the scoreboard can handle (an automatic win), or at the end of game, the player who won more scoring columns than their opponent, wins. Ties are broken by the player with the furthest advanced scoring marker.&#10;&#10;Originally published in spielbox magazine.&#10;&#10;";1994;5.98636;2.1429
1367;Grand National Derby;"This is the precursor to Titan: The Arena (later known as Colossal Arena) and Galaxy: The Dark Ages.&#10;&#10;The theme is horses racing in a steeplechase.  Each round represents a fence that the horses must jump.&#10;&#10;Players bet and then place speed cards on each horse.  When all of the horses have a speed card on them, the one with the lowest speed card is eliminated.  When there are three horses left (which happens after 5 rounds), the players are paid for their bets on the surviving horses.  Earlier bets are worth more.&#10;&#10;The game in each case is essentially similar to Titan: the Arena except:&#10;-  There are no special powers, nor special cards.&#10;-  The deck goes to 0-9, not 0-10.&#10;-  There are no secret bets.&#10;-  In four or five player games, each player gets 4 bets.&#10;-  If there is a tie for lowest card when a round ends, the tied horse furthest on the left is eliminated.

1371;Mustangs;"This game is about dogfights between fighters in WW2 using a very abstracted and simplified method to &quot;simulate&quot; flying.  The game is played in a number of impulses, with faster planes getting to move more often.  A maneuver can take several impulses to complete and is marked with a maneuver marker in the hex that shows the plane's final position.  The object is simply to shoot the other players down before they shoot you down.&#10;&#10;The basic game is relatively simple and pays some attention to realism (e.g., it has a unique system of simulating different maneuvers).  Some attempt was made with additional rules to attempt to add some sense of &quot;realism&quot; (with added complexity):  ammo and fuel limits, critical hits, pilot quality, spotting, multiple planes on each side, etc.&#10;&#10;Includes 95 counters.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;     Mustangs: Expansion Module &#10;&#10;&#10;";1991;6.63527;2.2759

1377;Danger;"In Danger, players draw numbered and colored cards, trying to collect as many points as possible in each color each round without exceeding the limit of 15 points.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player draws the top card from the deck and places it in front of her in a row for cards of that color; some cards are multicolor, and the player chooses in which row to play these cards. After laying a second card in the round, a player has the option of securing a row at the end of each turn. To secure a row, the player must not have the lowest total in that color when compared to the other players; the player secures a row by turning the last card in that row 90&ordm;. A player can secure only one row each turn.&#10;&#10;If a player exceeds a total of 15 points in a row, that row is now blocked and worth 0 points; the player turns those cards face-down.&#10;&#10;If a player draws a colored card for a row either secured or blocked, she must discard the card. The next player in turn order has the option of taking this discarded card instead of drawing randomly from the deck.&#10;&#10;Once the fourth row of any player is secured or blocked, the round ends immediately. Whoever has the fewest points in a color (with blocked rows worth 0 points) scores nothing for this color; all other players score points equal to the numbers showing in this color in their row. Players then empty their rows and continue playing with the cards remaining in the deck. After five complete rounds, the player with the highest total score wins.&#10;&#10;";2001;4.42288;1.125

1387;Alaska;"Players compete to collect their container blocks from a central island and return them across the ice sheet to their respective camps before the Spring thaw.&#10;&#10;The game runs in two parts; Winter as the players lay ice tiles across the hex board to the central island, and Spring as the thaw allows the players to remove ice tiles. In your turn, you draw from deck 1 which shows a 1,2 or 3 hex tile and a number on the winter/spring header/footer. After placing the tile in the hex-board, you then draw an action card from deck 2. Most are played immediately (Polar Bear, Frostbite, Found Container) but others you can save and use later (Robbery, Fog, Helicopter). Then the player can move their truck up to free places.&#10;&#10;A 3-hex ice tile counts as one space, so a player with a shorter route may profit early, but when the thaw comes, the other players can quickly remove the shortcut. The Polar Bear acts as a barrier and is often moved around. The other action cards can be beneficial (Found Container means you simply put a container in your truck where you are) or hinder you (Frostbite means you must drop the container and your truck jumps to your camp). Players can only rob dropped containers, not other trucks.&#10;&#10;The Spring thaw only comes when all the ice tiles that can be placed are down. You keep using deck 1, but simply read the alternative symbol for the thaw. There are fewer thaws, so the ice sheet stays active for some time, forcing players to make longer detours. You cannot remove an ice tile if it holds a truck or the bear, and tiles with dropped containers only go last. The game sort of stops when no containers can be collected, but since Helicopter action cards allow you to jump from place to place, the actual end-point is not precise.&#10;&#10;";1979;5.88974;1.4516
1389;Alles oder Nichts;"Game material&#10;48 playing cards&#10;42 trick indicator cards; 6 colored sets with values of 0 - 6&#10;1 scorepad&#10;1 pen&#10;1 rulebook&#10;&#10;Description of the game&#10;The main task of the 3 - 6 players is to correctly assess their cards. They use a trick indicator card to declare the number of tricks they expect to take. If they're right, they get a bonus. It's also up to the players to decide whether they will openly announce the tricks they expect to take or whether they keep it secret. But beware! A face-up trick indicator card increases the possibility that the other players will be able to influence the outcome. With increased risk it's true that you get: &quot;Alles oder Nichts (Double or Nothing)&quot;.&#10;&#10;A game last for seven rounds. Each player receives:&#10;in the 1st round - 6 cards&#10;in the 2nd round - 5 cards&#10;in the 3rd round - 4 cards&#10;in the 4th round - 3 cards&#10;in the 5th round - 4 cards&#10;in the 6th round - 5 cards&#10;in the 7th round - 6 cards&#10;&#10;After the cards are dealt, the dealer turns over the top card of the remaining cards. The color of this card is the trump color. After distributing the cards, players take the playing cards into their hand. Each player now judges for himself how many tricks he thinks he can take. Players select the appropriate card from their trick indicator cards and place it face-down in front of themselves&#10;&#10;Once all players have made their decision, the dealer, starting with the player to his left, asks each player if he wants to openly announce the number of tricks he plans to take (by turning over his trick indicator card) or if he wishes to keep it secret. Once each player has indicated his decision, the dealer asks the other players in clockwise order until all players, including the dealer have indicated their decision. Turning over the trick indicator card brings a higher risk but also potentially more points.&#10;&#10;Rules of play:&#10;&#10;Players must follow suit (play the same color as the card that was lead) if it is possible for them to do so.&#10;&#10;If a player cannot follow suit, he has two possibilities:&#10;1. Play trump - play a card of the trump color&#10;2. Throw off - play a card that is neither the trump color nor the color that was lead. You can never win a trick when you throw off.&#10;&#10;If no trump was played, the player who played the highest card of the suit that was lead wins the trick.&#10;If trump was played, the player who played the highest trump card wins the trick.&#10;&#10;If the trump color was lead, it must also be followed. If a player does not have any cards in the trump color, he must throw off a card with another color.&#10;&#10;Scoring&#10;Secret trick indicator cards:&#10;Players whose trick indicator cards were face-down get one point for each trick that they took. Players who took exactly as many tricks as noted on their trick indicator card get a 3 point bonus.&#10;&#10;Openly declared trick indicator cards:&#10;Players whose trick indicator cards were turned face-up only get points get if they take exactly as many tricks as they predicted. If they fulfill this condition, their score is equal to the number of tricks they took multiplied by 2 plus the 3 point bonus.&#10;&#10;Goal of the game&#10;The goal of the game is to have the most points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;";1988;5.05882;2.0

1393;Basta!;"... 38... and five makes 43... and seven makes 50... and that is the Finish, the End, Enough! Nobody may go over 50 points! However many special Action cards give the players the chance to push their luck for as long as possible before exceeding the limit. The one who finally gets caught, however, gets stuck with a penalty chip. The winner is the player with fewest penalty chips at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;";1994;5.61429;1.0
1397;Crash Pilot;"Crash Pilot rewards players who can quickly match shapes and colors. There are six rows of cards representing airplane stunts, and no row may contain two cards of the same color or shape. Each turn a player draws a card from his pile (or on the first turn from a neutral pile), then all players try to find a legal placement for that card; the first player to do so draws a card from his pile to start the next turn. Calling an incorrect row earns that player a crash chip, and three crash chips eliminates him from the game. The first player to run out of cards wins.&#10;&#10;Crash Pilot has also been published with a grocery store theme as Check Out.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.42768;1.125
1401;Crash!;"Demolition Derby on a small hex grid. Players have six cars each and roll dice to smash vehicles off the board.&#10;&#10;Published in 1992 as Crash! by Franjos and in 2007 as Manoover by Kadon. The published versions do not accommodate 3 players.&#10;&#10;Kadon has, by special order, a 2-sided gameboard that has the 2 player board on one side and the 3 player board on the reverse. (It comes with enough pieces for the three player game, of course.)&#10;&#10;";1992;6.27846;1.4
1403;Turn the Tide;"Players are dealt a hand of 12 from a deck of 1-60 (the remainder go back in the box for the whole game), and then lay out marker cards that show the other players the strength of their hand. Another scoring deck of 24 has values of 1-12; two cards from this deck are laid face up.&#10;&#10;Players choose one card from their hand in secret and reveal them simultaneously. The highest value played takes the lowest scoring card, which goes face-up to a pile in front of you. The second highest takes the other card likewise. Remaining cards are discounted. Then look at everyone's face-up deck: the highest scoring player turns one of his or her marker cards over! (The original game had cockatoos becoming cuckoos; this edition is themed on lifesavers). At the end of a round, players score according to their markers cards that they managed to save (cockatoos or life-savers).&#10;&#10;There is a further twist! Players then pick up all their playing hand, and pass it clockwise. So as each round commences, you are using the cards previously used by your neighbor! Are you smarter? Can you make a better fist of the same hand your neighbor had? Play out rounds until all players have had each hand. Top score wins.&#10;&#10;";1997;6.77993;1.5183

1407;Alcatraz;"Players try to escape from the prison island Alcatraz in this quite abstract game. Board resembles a chess board, it's a 9x9 grid where players must move their pieces from one end to the other. Each piece can move horizontally or vertically as many spaces as the player wishes, but there are few complications: the guards. Each row has a guard. Whenever a piece moves to a row, the guard on that row moves as many spaces towards the piece as the piece moved (if you move three rows up, the guard on that row moves three spaces towards you). If the guard catches you, the move is illegal. Of course, it's legal to make the guards catch other players' pieces... The first player to have three of their four pieces escape wins.&#10;&#10;Alcatraz is fun, quick game and a nice brain-teaser, especially with more than two players when the board gets quite crowded.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.51649;1.9091
1409;Spawn: The Game;"While this is essentially a Parchessi variant, the game mechanics were well adapted to the comic book character Spawn, as he was expressed at the time.&#10;&#10;Players play cards from their hands which may affect themselves, affect another player or function as tiles on the board.  In this case, they alter the movement point cost to enter that space.&#10;&#10;Next, players roll dice to build up power (movement) points and move their figure appropriately.&#10;&#10;As in Parcheesi, the first player to complete one trip around the board wins.&#10;&#10;Other items spice up this mix.  Power chips may be spent to add to your roll, but must be spent before you roll.  The Violator pawn sends a Spawn pawn back.  The Overtkill pawn makes it harder to enter its space.&#10;&#10;";1995;4.41241;1.0

1413;Attack Sub;"Attack Sub is a card based wargame similar to Up Front. The topic is modern submarine warfare (Mostly US/Nato vs. Soviet/Warsaw Pact, but there is an occasional Falklands War scenario.)&#10;&#10;Each player has one or more submarines and/or surface ships. Each ship is represented on an individual large card with counters showing current contact status and damage.&#10;&#10;Each player plays cards to increase their &quot;contact level&quot; relative to their opponent. Contact level abstractly represents relative position and sonar readings. It is possible for one ship to have a better contact on his enemy than the enemy has on him. When high enough contact level is reached, torpedoes can be fired.&#10;&#10;";1991;6.65731;2.2424

1417;Alibi;"The Whodunit Card Game: &quot;Murder in the big city, and you must solve the crime.  Brenda's dead, and foul play is suspected. To win, find out who did it, where, when, how, and why.&quot;&#10;&#10;This is a card game that shares some similarities with Clue, but adds some other questions to the mix, like what time of day did it happen, and what was the killer's motive? To the usual process of elimination and deduction found in most Clue-type games, they've added scoring elements.  You can collect sets of clues and reveal them to score points.  Obviously, though, this aids the other players as well by eliminating some categories.&#10;&#10;You start with a number of cards, each of which contains a specific clue. As play progresses, you can attempt to accumulate all the clues in a category, which will earn you points based on what turn you choose to reveal your set.&#10;&#10;Each turn, you are allowed to direct a question to a specific player.  The question must be answerable with a number.  For example, you may ask &quot;How many Cookie Carpenter cards do you have?&quot;  or  &quot;How many Jealousy cards have you seen?&quot;  Doing this will help you eliminate some of the icons (clues) on your score sheet.&#10;&#10;Your other option during your turn is to make an accusation. You need to be careful though, since this also will end the game! On the other hand, you do get some bonus points for being the First Accuser.&#10;&#10;Cards are passed after each player's turn. For the first round it is only one, but it increases by 1 for every round the game lasts.&#10;&#10;Once someone decides to accuse, all players can make any guesses they want to, filling in the answers they've come up with for each category (Suspect, Place, Weapon, Emotion).  You can also fill in the specific answer within a category for more points. The problem with guessing, though, is that wrong answers result in negative points, and the First Accuser loses double!&#10;&#10;";1993;5.51394;1.7925
1419;Pylos;"In Pylos, you want to be one who places the final ball on top of the pyramid. Sounds simple enough, right?&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player has fifteen balls, either light or dark, and they take turns placing them on a game board that has sixteen indentations on it in a 4x4 grid. Once four balls have been placed next to one another in a square, a ball can be placed on top of them, forming a second level of play. Players can then place balls on this second level, eventually allowing a ball to be placed on the third level &ndash; and once that level is full, which requires only four balls, a final ball can be placed on the fourth level, with that player winning the game.&#10;&#10;If a player forms a square of his own color &ndash; that is, four balls placed next to one another on the same level &ndash; that player can remove one or two of his balls (that don't support anything) from anywhere on the board and place them in his reserve, thereby giving him more balls to place in the future. Whenever a player forms a square that's not entirely his own color, he can &quot;stack&quot; one of his pieces &ndash; that is, he can take any ball and place it on this square, locking some pieces in place and making a move without having to place a piece from his reserve.&#10;&#10;The rules include a variant for children (that removes the square bonus) and one for experts (that allows a player to return 1-2 balls to his reserve when he creates a line of his color).&#10;&#10;Reimplements&#10;&#10;&#10;    Strat-O-Sphere&#10;&#10;&#10;";1993;6.30625;1.9187
1421;Lost Worlds;"&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;        GAME SYSTEM&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         This entry is to allow for discussion/rating of the game system as a whole. It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10; Lost Worlds is the most popular entry in Alfred Leonardi's line of book games, which also includes Ace of Aces.  Each player has a character card and a booklet (and sometimes special Tactics, Luck, or Spell cards) for one of about fifty (and growing) medieval-fantasy characters.  Characters can range from barbarian warriors to animated skeletons to elven archers to unicorns &mdash; even two different dragons.  Booklets are traded and, as each player selects a move, a reference grid in the books determine the results (wounds, off-balance maneuvers, and so on).  Combat continues until one fighter or the other expires.&#10;&#10;An interesting feature of the Lost Worlds system is that, under some versions of the rules, characters may improve their abilities as they gain experience.  In theory, you are supposed to keep track of your progress with each character, and if one is utterly killed, it will have to start over without its improved skills.&#10;&#10;Part of the Lost Worlds series of books.&#10;&#10;";1983;6.55732;1.6905
1423;Storm over Arnhem;"This is the first of the Area-Impulse games done by Avalon Hill which later included Thunder at Cassino, Turning Point: Stalingrad and Breakout Normandy. The game simulates the ferocious battle for the Arnhem Bridge on September 18-21, 1944.&#10;&#10;The game begins with the British holding the area around the bridge, surrounded by the Germans. They try to hold out for as long as they can.&#10;&#10;Each full turn covers 8 hours and includes many mini-turns (or impulses). Each impulse, the player can move or fire a small number units. Once moved or fired, the units are &quot;committed&quot; and cannot move or fire again until the next turn.&#10;&#10;Combat is handled by calculating attack and defense values with each side adding the roll of 2 dice. The difference (if the attacker has the higher total) in final point values is the number of casualty points the defender must lose by retreating or destroying units.&#10;&#10;The games is of relatively low complexity for a wargame and rates 3 (out of 10) on AH's difficulty scale.&#10;&#10;";1981;7.19343;2.8992
1425;Raid on St. Nazaire;"This solitaire wargame simulates the March 28, 1942, British raid on the Nazi-occupied French port of St. Nazaire.&#10;&#10;In the first part of the game, the player moves the British boats and destroyer HMS Campbeltown (camouflaged as a German ship) to their landing areas, while determining the results of the many shots from the harbor defense guns.  Upon landing, the remaining force tries to reach targets  (sub pens, caissons, docked ships, supply tanks, etc.) and destroy them.&#10;&#10;The German guards are handled by the game system and arrive via random draw and placement and move by most direct route to the nearest British commando.  As the game progresses, the German units get tougher and better organized.&#10;&#10;The game ends when either all British units are killed or escape and they score for the targets destroyed.&#10;&#10;";1987;7.25939;3.0198

When a germ is surrounded, it dies.&#10;&#10;The petri dish contains 4 goal areas.  The first player to gain exclusive control of 3 of the 4 areas, wins.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a board (representing the petri dish), 16 red and 16 blue 7/8&quot; poker chips (the germs), 2 pages of rules, and 2 reference/illustration cards.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.53846;2.0
1431;War at Sea (Second Edition);"War at Sea is a simple, strategic wargame covering the Battle of the Atlantic and naval warfare in the Mediterranean in WW2.&#10;&#10;The game divides the contested seas into 6 areas.  Each turn the players move their ships from home ports to one or more of the areas.&#10;&#10;After all ships have been moved a battle occurs.  After a number of rounds, until one side or the other retreats or loses all of his/her ships, the player with ships left takes control of the area and scores a number of &quot;Points of Control (POC)&quot;.  If German U-boats survive anti-submarine combat they may stay in the area, even if the area contains Allied ships, and prevent the Allies from controlling the area and scoring points for it.&#10;&#10;The Allied player has the additional challenge of escorting convoys across the Atlantic. Any that reach England score one POC. If one reaches Russia it scores a BIG three POCs.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill&#10;&#10;";1976;6.55929;1.9559

1443;Alpha Blitz;"Alpha Blitz consists of two different games.&#10;&#10;Alpha is a word game for 2 players. there are 98 cards with letters on them and 10 blitz cards showing a lightning bolts. These are shuffled together and six are laid out between the players. Each player gets 3 cards in their start hand. On your turn you try to make the longest word possible with the six letters showing on the table using each letter as many times as you want. For example you could make the word letters with the letters L, E, T, R, and S showing. Each turn you must cover one letter with a card from your hand and then draw another card. You may do this before or after you make a word. If you cover a letter with a blitz card that pile is permanently out so as the game progresses there are less letters to use. You receive 1 point for making a word. 1 point for every letter in the word more then the number of letter piles. You also get 1 point for each J, K, Qu, X and Z you use. The game ends when there are only 2 letter piles left.&#10;&#10;Blitz is a word game for 3-6 players. Each player has a hand of 3 cards. 2 cards are placed face down in front of each player. All cards are turned up at the same time. The first player to call out a word that can be formed with the letters showing gets 1 point plus 1 point for each J, K, Qu, X and Z they used. The second player to call out a word gets 2 points but the word must be longer then the previous word. This continues until all players have called out a word or passed due to not seeing a legal word. Each round is started by covering a letter from your hand. The game ends when one player has both letter piles covered with a blitz card.&#10;&#10;Alpha Blitz was awarded the title &quot;Best Word Game&quot; by Games Magazine in 1999.&#10;&#10;";1998;4.875;1.8333

1447;1841: Railways in Northern Italy;"1841 is the apex (or nadir depending on your point of view) of 18xx stock-market manipulation. Set in Northern Italy during a period of rapid political change (borders for playable hexes change twice during the course of the game) the game is one of the most difficult even for experienced 18xx players.&#10;&#10;The greatest innovations center on the ability of companies to own shares in other public companies and the merging of companies. Train obsolescence is rapid and unforgiving, and it is quite possible for forced-purchase trains to be obsolete before they get a chance to run. Capitalization is on a per-share basis throughout the game and train prices are steep &gt;1400 for an 8 train - the largest.&#10;&#10;There are 8 historical corporations and eight, named but ahistorical &quot;generic&quot; corporations. These are normally used simply as investment vehicles to maximize the amount of capital available to &quot;successful&quot; companies close to Milan. Northern Italy is mountainous, especially near the off-board Alpine areas and to the South of the map, making progress slow and expensive for the outlying historical companies.&#10;&#10;1841 has a reputation as a very long game, but is not necessarily much longer than games, such as 1870, which have a very large bank. It can be completed in four hours.&#10;&#10;Chris Lawson's game kit is one version that is available and is of his usual high (for a game kit) quality. A large amount of time with scissors and craft knife to cut out the stock and tiles can be expected.  Deep Thought Games now publishes 1841v2 which incorporates changes by Manlio Manzini to address some of the perceived shortcomings with the original which was designed by Federico Vellani with Manlio as a co-author.&#10;&#10;Description by Steve Thomas:&#10;&#10;1841 is the 18xx game of choice for many players, though some hate it. Designed, and originally published as 1839 by Federico Vellani, it is set in northern Italy. The McGuffin here is that 1841 is the 18xx game which is least about actually building a railway and most about manipulating the stock market and managing the extremely fierce train obsolescence. Route development has its place, but unless the players can get the rest of the game about right they are doomed, and it is this which polarizes players' views of the game. When it first became available it whetted the slightly jaded palates of some players since the dividing line between success and abject failure is so narrow. 1841 achieves this by allowing companies to buy and sell shares in each other, and to merge with one another. These factors result in frequent and hard-to-predict changes to the order in which the companies operate. It's exciting and dynamic, and the only real downside, at least for &quot;the financiers who've had enough of the engineers&quot;, to misquote the 1853 box art, is the length of the game. At typically seven hours it cannot sensibly be played in an evening. Even so, the game is usually well worth the investment of time, though it's certainly not for the novice.&#10;&#10;";1994;7.91335;4.4773

The board is constructed before each game so it will always be differant. It is a double track with a picture of a dice in the center of each space.  The pawns are wide at the base so when you place them in a space they cover the picture of the dice.  At the start of your turn you chose one of your 4 pieces, state the number under it and then if your memory was correct move the pawn that many spaces.

Each player, armed with a fistful of dice, starts his turn by rolling 5 dice and placing as many of them as possible on a card, though you must always place at least one if you can.  Each card has 6 rows, with from 1 to six dice pictured in each row.  These are in various combinations, and dice must be placed in order in each row.  As long as you place at least one die, and you have not used all of your 5 dice, you can then choose to roll again.  If you choose to stop, or you roll dice with no legal placement available, your turn is over.&#10;&#10;Scoring is achieved by placing the last die in a row and scoring can be a negative.

While XXXenophile's theme and artwork were rated R, Girl Genius can be played by families without grandma getting embarrassed.  (However, a couple cards do feature scantily dressed women.)&#10;&#10;Each player gets a five-card hand and 12 cards are laid out face-down in a patchwork pattern.  Each card has colored symbols along each side, a point value, and special instructions. On your turn, you turn over one face-down card then spin any face-up card 180 degrees.  After spinning, if any of the symbols on the edges of the spun card match the symbols on one or more of the surrounding cards, you &quot;pop&quot; the card(s) with the most matching symbols.  &quot;Popping&quot; a card means you must follow the instructions on the card (whether helpful or harmful) and then (usually) add it to your score pile.  Cards in your hand are used to replace any popped cards.  The game is played until one player has 100 points or has captured a combination of submarine and dirigible cards.&#10;&#10;Unlike most of Cheapass Games's games, this one is professionally manufactured with full color, laminated cards with rounded corners.&#10;&#10;";2001;6.04974;1.9355
1465;Wizard;"The trick-taking game Wizard uses a sixty-card deck that consists of the traditional 52-card deck (1-13 in four suits) along with four Wizards (high) and four Jesters (low).&#10;&#10;Players compete over multiple rounds based on the number of players, and whoever ends with the highest score wins. In each round, players are dealt a hand of cards &mdash; one card in the first round, two cards in the second, three in the third, etc. &mdash; then trump is determined by flipping the top card of the undealt deck; if a suit is revealed, that suit is trump, while if the card turned up is a Jester, it is turned down and there is no trump for that round. If the card turned up is a Wizard, the dealer chooses one of the 4 suits as the trump suit. The dealer cannot choose &quot;no trump&quot;. On the last round of each game all cards are dealt out so there is no trump. Players then state how many tricks they expect to win in the round.&#10;&#10;The playing and winning of the tricks uses mostly standard trick-taking rules. If a player leads a suited card, then all other players must follow suit, if possible. If a player leads a Jester, then the second player determines the suit led. If a player leads a Wizard, then those who follow can play whatever they want. However, in all cases a player may always play a Wizard or Jester, even if they hold cards in the suit led.&#10;&#10;After each player has played a card, determine the winner of the trick as follows: If one or more Wizards were played, the player of the first Wizard wins the trick, collects the cards, and leads to the next trick. If not, whoever played the highest trump wins the trick. If not, whoever played the highest card of the suit led wins the trick. If all players played Jesters, whoever played the first Jester wins.&#10;&#10;After all tricks have been played, players tally their score for the round. If a player matched their bid, winning exactly as many tricks as stated at the start of the round, they score 20 points, plus 10 points for each trick taken. If a player missed their bid, they lose 10 points for each trick that they were off, whether they took more or fewer than predicted.&#10;&#10;A common variant in Wizard is to not allow the total number of tricks bid in a round to match the round number, thereby forcing (at least) one player to be off each round.&#10;&#10;";1984;6.98469;1.7061
1467;Abduction;"The players take the role of victims of an alien abduction trying to escape from captivity on an alien ship.  The object is to be the first to escape...&quot;the others better not get in the way&quot;.  Cards are placed by the players throughout the game to determine the ship's layout, and represent the exploration of the ship.  Other cards allow players to find weapons, or use other special powers, by holding a specific card or playing other cards as events.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;     CCG Workshop (no longer available)&#10;&#10;&#10;";1998;5.25791;1.4643
1471;Gangsters;"Players are &quot;bosses&quot; of organized crime in Chicago during the Prohibition era.  Rival gangs fight over Speakeasies, Gambling Joints, and Protection Rackets.  They try to direct the public into their &quot;stablishmunts&quot;, whilst keeping the donut-boys-in-blue out.  Using their Racketeers, Thugs and Vamps the players try to obtain joints and make money from the &quot;unsuspecting&quot; public who just happen to walk in to them.  The game is fast moving, as each players turn is timed, and has some dire results.  For example, when a hit is made the player who was shot gets a soaking (one trigger press only) with the *included* water pistol!  There are numerous paths to victory that the players can take with their gang, with the twist that in the five player version one of the players has to play the cops...short-straw anyone?&#10;&#10;";1992;6.30588;2.4857
1473;Barbarians: 70 BC - 260 AD;"Barbarians recreates the situation along the Rhine-Danube frontier of the Roman Empire in the years 70 BC to 260 AD.&#10;&#10;The game has 32 scenarios which can be played solitaire or by 2 players. Some scenarios can be adapted for play by 3 or 4 players. Scenarios range in playing time from 2 to 20 hours.&#10;&#10;It has an 8 page rulebook and is a straight forward UGO/IGO hex and counter war game. It is very much the unofficial expansion to Caesar&#039;s Legions. The rules are 99% similar to Caesar&#039;s Legions.&#10;&#10;Enemies of Rome depicted in the game include Roman Rebels, Germans, Britons, Pannonians, Gauls, Batavii, Sarmations (Roxolanni and Iazyges), Goths, Vandals, Bastarnae and Dacians.&#10;&#10;In the Designer Notes Keith Poulter acknowledges:&#10;&#10;&quot;The point of departure for the design was a fine game originally published under the title Eagles, and subsequently by Avalon Hill as Caesar&#039;s Legions.&quot;&#10;&#10;In the Designer Notes Keith Poulter asked for feedback on the game as:&#10;&#10;&quot;Such feedback will be valuable, as we planned multi-scenario expansion kits (7 additional maps in all) covering western and southern Gaul, Spain, and Britain.&quot;&#10;&#10;These expansions were never published.&#10;&#10;However, a related game (by different designers) using the Caeser's Legions system is Caesar in Gaul.&#10;&#10;";1994;5.40105;2.8462
1475;Careers;"Careers is a game where the players set their own victory conditions.  A player may choose to pursue Fame, Happiness, Money, or a combination of all three.  The limitation being that the total number of &quot;points&quot; earned in the 3 categories must total 60.  eg. 60 Happiness, 0 Fame, 0 Money; 20 of each; or any other combination.  The players endeavor to fulfill their goal by going through any number of different &quot;occupation paths&quot;.  All paths have some prerequisite for entry, and benefits accrue from going through any of the paths more than once.  The different occupations are designed to be suited to different strategies, eg. Hollywood is good for fame points, while &quot;Going to Sea&quot; is good for happiness.  In the end it is the player (or team of players) who gets to their pre-set goal first who will be the winner, and achieve everything they ever wanted in life.&#10;&#10;";1955;5.86639;1.4865
1477;Days of Decision II;"Days of Decision II is a strategic level game about the politics and conflicts that created the Second World War. The period covered is 1936-46, and the players can make (or choose not to make) many of the decisions that led to the war.&#10;&#10;The game is very detailed in its political aspect, and is more a political game than a wargame. Each country affected by the war is represented on an &quot;ideological&quot; chart which tracks the movement of the powers into the different spheres of influence: Fascist, Communist and Democrat.  Where each country lies on this chart is vital to which country controls their decisions and forces.  Political decisions are chosen from a large array of IPOs (International Policy Options) and a number of Political Options available only to the country that you're playing.&#10;&#10;The game is based on the original Days of Decision (I) but is almost a new game. The old one had 4 million possible outcomes, this one has over one hundred trillion (according to the game designer).&#10;&#10;";1994;6.36797;3.6875

You have to discover your mystery identity by interrogating the other players: Am I dead? Am I fat? Can I sing? Am I a bore? Personalities range from cartoon characters, to politicians, to movie stars. There's a limit to how many questions you can ask - so choose carefully.

All the special roles are up for grabs: &quot;Man falling off roof&quot;, &quot;Crying woman&quot;, &quot;Stagecoach driver&quot;, &quot;Dead man&quot;, and more. Yes, they're all available, and if you're good enough &ndash; that is, if you progress up through the &quot;hack&quot; levels represented by the number on your character's die &ndash; you may even get to play that complicated character part &quot;Rear-end of Horse&quot;!&#10;&#10;In Deadwood Studios USA (originally published as Deadwood), players wander across the backlot each day, looking for acting jobs. Your actor is a six-sided die, and the number on top represents your status. (These dice are never rolled; they just show your status.) After you take a role in the movie, you can roll a die and try to &quot;act&quot;, or you can &quot;rehearse&quot; to improve your odds. As you work, you'll earn money and fame, and you can trade those things at the casting office for higher status, which brings you the ability to take better-paying roles.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, you add up your money, fame, and status points, and the player with the highest score is the best actor at Deadwood Studios!&#10;&#10;";1999;5.89203;1.5057
1491;Outpost;"Players compete to build the best outpost.  They must build and staff factories to produce resources, which are then used to build more factories, and purchase any of 13 outpost improvements that give different advantages (ranging from production technologies, resource storage, and increased population maximums to resource producing stations).  Improvements are purchased through auctions, and each player may win several per round.  There are 3 phases in the game, and with each phase after the first, a new set of improvements is available to purchase.  Each staffed factory and improvement is worth a certain number of victory points (ranging from 1 pt for an ore factory to 20 points for a moon base), and the first player to reach 75 points wins.&#10;&#10;This game's mechanisms were later reused in The Scepter of Zavandor and, to a lesser extent, in Phoenicia.&#10;&#10;";1991;6.80236;3.1138

It involves five-foot-six and metre gauges, hills, mountains and the Himalayas, contract bids and government mails. The technical challenges of building a railroad network in difficult country stand on a par with the financial market manipulation which usually dominates the 18xx games.&#10;&#10;Time to play is listed as 4-7 hours.

1495;Stash;"From the same people who brought the politically incorrect Dog Eat Dog comes an even more politically incorrect game of drug selling.  You and up to 4 other dealers travel around a Monopoly looking outer track buying drugs and picking up the ever present action card.  In this case it is a rock concert card.  You buy drugs (properties) and then you can enter the inner map which is a representation of New York neighborhoods in an attempt to sell them.&#10;&#10;The more money you make selling drugs the more you can skim off some of the drugs to get high on.  Getting high gives you karma points but beware the bad trips.  If you gain 40 karma you win.&#10;&#10;The game is actually very involved and not just a different version of Monopoly.

1497;Dino Hunt;"A collectible card game from Steve Jackson aimed directly at the kids.&#10;&#10;The core game comes with everything you need and boosters just add more options.  Each player gets 10 action points each turn to go back in time and collect dinosaurs.  You start your turn by rolling a die and putting out that many new dinos for hunting.  You travel to different time periods and hunt the dinos by rolling a die and comparing the total to a list on the card.  A good roll allows you to capture the dino but a bad roll can have other consequences including ending your turn prematurely.  Each dino cost variable action points to hunt and moving from one time period to another also costs action points.  You also collect various items that can help you and there are action cards that have good and bad effects.  When the stack of dinos has been exhausted and all dinos have been captured or have escaped the game is over.  Whoever has captured the most dino points wins.&#10;&#10;The beauty of this game is not in game play but the cards themselves.  There is a large picture of the dinosaur and enough info to put a reference book to shame.  As a bonus there is also a phonetic spelling of the name.  Without the special cards this game can be played by 5 year olds with a little help.&#10;&#10;";1996;5.37472;1.4516

Five full-colour maps portray all the theatres of war: Europe, Russia, Africa, the Middle East, India, Asia, the Pacific, the Atlantic and (most importantly) Australia.&#10;&#10;[...]Counters represent the armies and corps, the aircraft carriers, the naval task forces and the air groups that took part. Everything you need to re-fight the greatest conflict in history.&#10;&#10;Two to six players make the strategic decisions that decide the fate of nations.

1501;Masterpiece;"Van Gogh, Rembrandt, Renoir --- paintings by the world's most famous artists are on the auction block, for sale to the highest bidder. How high will you bid before the tension and bluffing get to you? And how good's your eye --- can you spot a forgery when you buy one?&#10;&#10;The MASTERPIECE game combines the excitement of a fast-paced board game with the glamour and sophistication of a game that deals with fine art. Some of the world's greatest paintings, illustrated in full-color postcards, are an integral part of gameplay.&#10;&#10;The high-stakes world of international art --- and the power plays of an auction --- will entertain and enlighten as you join a particularly eccentric group of collectors who've all come in search of a MASTERPIECE.&#10;&#10;Each player takes the role of an art collector and tries to amass the greatest fortune in cash and the value of art pieces in their collection.&#10;&#10;The painting cards are randomized and placed face down in a stack.  Matching size value cards are also mixed and placed face down in a stack.  These value cards indicate the worth of the painting ranging from forgery (zero) to $1,000,000.  Each player receives an equal sum of money and one painting with value card which are clipped together so that all players can see the painting and only the owning player can see the value.  When paintings are drawn from the stack, a value card is clipped to them in this fashion.  Players move around the board by die roll and land on spaces that allow the player to collect money from the bank, receive a painting from the stack, sell a painting to the bank for its value, sell a painting to the bank for a specified amount, auction one of their paintings to the highest bidding opponent, or auction the top painting in the stack to the highest bidder.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the painting stack is exhausted.  Players add the values of their paintings to their cash on hand.  The player with the largest total wins.&#10;&#10;";1970;5.76056;1.4408
1503;Mid-East Peace;"Mid-East Peace is one of those great games where luck really doesn't play a part, once initial country selection is made.&#10;&#10;The game is set during the pressure cooker situation of the early 90's and the tension of the game certainly reflects this. Players out-maneuver and out-bluff one another so as to gain the riches of the region, while making sure they spend enough of the &quot;oil/money&quot; to ensure the safety of their state. The tension is kept up by secret deployment of forces and the continual angst of balancing resource spending with the saving necessary to come off the winner. It is, usually, the richest player, the one who has probably spent least on 'defense' throughout the game that will come off the victor. But, the twist is that the game can end in war or peace, and there are different victory conditions depending on which of the two outcomes it ends in. A very hard balance to maintain.&#10;&#10;";1990;5.13079;2.4375
1507;Isis;"A beautiful solid-wood game that uses a reproduction of an Ancient Egyptian game's components (board and pieces; unfortunately, this game's original ancient rules are lost) and adapts them with thoroughly modern rules.&#10;Players maneuver neutral pieces into a position where they can be personalized, and then try to maneuver the personalized piece onto one of two throne spaces to claim victory.&#10;How much a piece moves depends on how many pieces there are in its section of the board.&#10;A perfect information, non-random game, it becomes very tense with several players as the consequences of your move take several turns to become clear.&#10;&#10;";1992;5.92857;2.5
1509;Dogfight;"Dogfight is one of the American Heritage games in the &quot;Command decision&quot; series of wargames published by Milton Bradley circa 1961-65. Definitely not for the hardcore wargamer, Dogfight is a light version of WWI air combat. The Germans and Americans each get 6 biplanes divided into 2 squadrons of 3 planes each. Each squadron gets a hand of combat maneuver cards and players move one plane from each squadron engaging and evading each other. For each plane shot down you receive an ace token that entitles you to hold a larger hand of cards. Anti-Aircraft guns guard each home squadron and the lucky flyer has the opportunity to strafe the enemies planes on the ground. A great introductory wargame with easy to learn rules.&#10;&#10;";1963;6.37854;1.4528
1511;Outdoor Survival;"Lost and alone, you must survive and escape the woods.  There are 5 different scenarios from inexperienced hikers lost in the woods to a rescue party trying to find a lost person.  You will have to deal with animals, finding food and water, mother nature and sickness without dying to win.&#10;&#10;";1972;4.901;1.7692
1513;The Republic of Rome;"The Republic of Rome is an abstraction of over 250 years of history.  It simulates the politics of the Roman Senate during the republic.  The players take the part of various factions vying for the control of the senate.  They control the various powerful families of the time, who compete for state offices, military command, economic concessions and new adherents.  To win the player must get their faction to become the most powerful in Rome.  While doing this, however, a balance must be maintained.  A hostile world situation, and the vagaries of the public of Rome means that the players must also cooperate so that Rome herself doesn't go down under this pressure.  If Rome does not last, neither does the senate, and all players lose!&#10;&#10;Players make proposals to the Senate which other players then vote on. A player's ability to make proposals is determined by which Offices his/her Senators hold. A player's influence in votes is determined by the number of Senators they have recruited and the level of influence those Senators have obtained. Proposals may include assigning Senators to govern provinces (generating revenue), recruiting an army to fight an external foe, addressing the concerns of the Roman people, assigning offices or prosecuting previous office holders. Players have to co-operate to overcome the various threats that the game sends against Rome (wars, famine, unrest, bankruptcy) whilst working to build their own Senators' and Generals' positions and undermine that of their opponents. A powerful General or an influential Senator may become Emperor (thus winning the game) but equally may suddenly fall to the plague or an assassin's blade.&#10;&#10;";1990;7.53984;4.3686
1515;Upwords;"Players take turns forming words on either an 8x8 (original and Winning Moves &quot;new classic&quot; versions) or a 10x10 (most later versions) grid. Words may be formed horizontally or vertically, as in Scrabble, but, as the title suggests, the letters may also be stacked.  This allows already played words to change into different words by stacking new letters (up to a limit of 5 high). For example, LATE could be changed to CATER and then to BELATED. Instead of having different values for each letter, when a new word is formed, the number of tiles used in that word is counted.  If the whole word is one tile high (no stacking), then the word scores 2 points per tile.  However, if there are any stacked tiles, you score one point per tile in the word, including those underneath.  This results in scoring that increases as the game continues, even for simpler words.&#10;&#10;";1982;5.75108;1.6767

You move your characters in groups around the board trying to get items. As you do you will set off disasters that have to be dealt with. Sometimes they guard a site but a lot of them start roaming the board looking for fights.

The world we see around us is an illusion hiding True Reality, a horrible illusion fabricated to keep humanity at bay, and to prevent our awakening.&#10;&#10;That is the premise to the darkest of the CCGs.  You play an Archon or an Angel of Death.  You lay beings or regions around you and to the side in a Tarot type layout.  On these cards you can play influence cards.  Your spell casters can play spells and there are commandments that you can play that have instant effects.  On your turn you try to influence the population at large by moving population counters onto your outer cards then to your inner cards then onto the card representing you.  With 2 players there are 9 population markers and the first to sway 5 wins.  Of course along the way your beings will be throwing everything but the kitchen sink at each other.&#10;&#10;Between the subject matter and the dark and very graphic cards this is not a kids game.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.91337;2.5238

1523;Pharao;"This is the third in the Pharao-Brettspiele series of games, the other two being Isis and Ramses.&#10;The board is an Ancient Egyptian Senet board, and the game can be played as such if one supplies the throwing sticks (randomizing devices that eventually evolved into dice; available in commercial Senet sets or easily home-made).  Note, however, that there are only 4 pieces per player instead of the almost-standard 5 (historically, the number of pieces per player varied between 5 and 10), so a fifth piece would ideally need to be supplied.&#10;H. A. Renz chose, once more, to use the components for an entirely different, modern abstract strategy game.  Each player uses two special dice to move both his pieces and his adversary's (this is the only game of the triad to have a random element).  The object of the game is to either &quot;push&quot; all adversary pieces into the water (a special square), occupy the &quot;happiness&quot; square with one's last remaining piece, or box the adversary in so he cannot move.&#10;Note how driving towards one victory condition (by adversary elimination) actually opens up a victory opportunity for the adversary --a neat twist.&#10;Remarkably, the starting position is asymmetric because the board is asymmetric.  There does not seem to be much of an advantage or handicap to being one side or the other.&#10;&#10;";1984;6.63158;1.5
1525;Dixie: Bull Run;"Gather your armies and fight over 3 positions.  Cards represent infantry or cavalry regiments or artillery batteries.  The uniform colors and styles are the uniforms that the regiments actually wore (according to the designers).  You also have cards representing the participating generals , terrain and the ever present special events.&#10;&#10;It is a collectible card set but with a flat rarity.  There is the original set of 200 cards representing the Battle of Bull Run.  The second set at 400 cards was the Battle of Shiloh.  The third set at 250 cards was the Battle of Gettysburg.&#10;&#10;All artwork and graphics in the Dixie series were created by RPG/Historical artist, Eric Hotz.&#10;&#10;";1994;6.3285;2.0435

1529;Ramses;"Each of the two players is trying to maneuver his four pieces onto specially marked squares or to box his adversary in (if he cannot move any piece, he's lost).  On your turn you move first one of your own pieces, then one of your adversary's.&#10;&#10;The pieces move orthogonally (as long as they don't go twice through the same square during a move) by as many squares as there are pieces in its starting column and row (using the larger number, counting itself).&#10;The game has Chess-like qualities since there is no randomness at all, and each player has perfect information.&#10;&#10;";1988;6.315;3.0
1531;Ritter ohne Furcht und Tadel;"Depending upon the number of players, each player receives 1 or 2 knights.  Each of these knights lists a series of dice pips on the card, some of which are red in color.  These red numbers are the knights defensive abilities, and he will block these numbers if rolled by an opponent during a competition.  For instance, Upollonius Wolkenburg has a 1, 2 and 3 in red.  Thus, he will block one of each of these numbers each time dice are rolled by an opponent in a competition.  Some knights have less numbers in red, but they usually have a greater attack strength, meaning they can roll more dice in combat.  This mechanism borrows very heavily from many role playing and fantasy games.&#10;&#10;In addition to these 'defense' numbers and the attack dice chart, each knight card also has charts for prizes won (1 - 15) and damage points (1 - 10).  There are also nice illustrations on each card ... about the only kind thing I can say about the game.&#10;&#10;Each player also receives a 'lady' card.  Each lady possesses a number of characteristics, including hair color, build, height and personality.  When granting her favor to a knight (which is indicated by placing a corresponding token onto a knight card), the idea is to seek out a knight who desires similar characteristics in a lady.&#10;&#10;The start player challenges an opposing knight with one of his knights.  A challenge cannot be refused.  These two enter battle, which involves each player tossing a number of dice equal to their attack strength into the tournament field.  In mounted combat, any 1's, 2's or 3's thrown strike a blow, unless these are blocked by the opponent.  If any of these dice strike, the knight falls from his horse and the knight suffers hit points equal to the number of blows which were landed.  If only one knight is struck and falls from his horse, the opponent wins and earns a prize for himself and for his lady.  If both knights fall from their horse, then the match continues on foot.  This involves more dice rolling, but 4's, 5's and 6's now strike.  This continues until one knight concedes or reaches 10 damage points, at which time he is out of the tournament (and out of the game).&#10;&#10;The next player in turn order then challenges a knight.  This process is repeated until there is only one healthy knight remaining. The round then ends and victory points are doled out to the knight and lady who won the most prizes.  There are also potential bonuses which add to the players' scores.&#10;&#10;";1998;4.34;1.6154
1533;Ghost Chase;"One player takes the role of Max, the ghost.  Max hides himself in the Canterville castle.  The other players are the ghost chasers and search for Max in the castle.  Max and the ghost chasers begin the game in rooms of their choice.  The Max and his chasers move room to room.  Max moves invisibly, showing himself only from time to time.  The creatures living around the castle determine when Max must show himself.  After each game round, one animal is removed from the board.  When all animals of one type have been removed, Max must show which room he is in and how he got there.  Max has a code of honor and will not enter the same room twice during the chase.&#10;&#10;Unlike Max, the chasers may enter each room as often as they like.  They try to force Max into a dead end to catch him.  All the chasers win if one of the chasers enters the room where Max is.  If the last animal is removed from the board with Max having not been found, the player playing the role of Max is the winner!&#10;&#10;";2001;6.25675;1.6757
1535;Formula 1;"A simple racing game where speed and movement is decided by the driver and not the dice. Only when exceeding safety speeds on the bends are dice used to decide the penalty incurred.&#10;&#10;The players use &quot;dashboards&quot;, cardboard cutouts resembling dashboards, complete with a speedometer and tire and brake wear gauges.  Maximum acceleration is fixed, tire and brake wear may happen as a result of cornering too quickly&mdash;then there are the dreaded spinouts.  A few tight spots exist, so blocking is also an effective tactic.&#10;Tactic cards (you get 5 for the entire race) put a few aces up your sleeve.  They can give you an extra burst of speed or of cornering ability.&#10;&#10;Pit stops will get you fresh brakes and tires but you must reach them by exact count&mdash;otherwise you're forced into another lap.  Also, pit cards throw a monkeywrench in&mdash;usually you'll lose a turn, but now and then you'll get extra fast service, a burst of speed in coming out of the pit, or special brakes good for one extra corner.&#10;&#10;The race runs for up to 10 laps; the player furthest past the finish line when all players have had the same number of turns wins.&#10;The game's simplicity makes it accessible to younger players, whilst it remains enjoyable by adults.&#10;&#10;";1962;6.69123;1.7049

Lead your fleets in battle to conquer the universe.&#10;&#10;Space Empires is an intriguing multiplayer game of interstellar conflict. The special weapons and abilities of the contending races give this game a unique flavor.&#10;&#10;Rulebook Excerpts&#10;&#10;The conflict begins as players build armadas of Starships to conquer worlds. The player's purpose in Space Empires is the imposition of his form of government on other alien races and to gather new allies in the conquest of the known universe...&#10;&#10;A player wins the game by controlling seven or more races for two consecutive victory phases . . . Alternatively, the players may agree on a time limit, the player at the end of the game with the most races wins, with ties being resolved in favor of the player with the highest production point total . . . Any other result is a draw.&#10;&#10;User Summary&#10;&#10;A relatively simple hex-and-counter game of space conquest in a galactic zone populated by twelve alien races. Players seek to expand their control over the star systems scattered across the map. This increases the player's production capabilities which allows more starships to be built.&#10;&#10;The interesting twist, sort of a Cosmic Encounters &quot;lite,&quot; is that each alien race has a special ability. When a player conquers the home world of an alien race, the player can then start building starships for that race. The special powers of the alien starships include the paralyzing ray of the Amoebas, the Gort repulsion field generator, Parasite energy absorption, and the cloaking device of the Slinkers.&#10;&#10;";1981;6.41111;2.2

Monsters include such loathesome creatures as trolls, ogres, zombies, goblins, lycanthropes, men, and the horribly alluring succubus.  Each has an offensive potential as well as a defensive capability based on the type of creature vs. the Hero's weapon and how mightily he wields it.

TACTICS II is a direct descendant of this original board wargame.&#10;&#10;TACTICS II is sort of like military chess. Different pieces, called &quot;units&quot; in wargames, have different capabilities just like chess pieces. The major difference is that a player can move all his pieces each turn, and after all his pieces are moved, battles are resolved against the enemy units his pieces are next to (adjacent to).&#10;&#10;The other major difference between wargames and chess is that wargames have a mapboard, divided into squares or hexagons for movement purposes. TACTICS II has a 22&quot; x 28&quot; mapboard portraying a fictional continent with two countries, Blue and Red. Terrain includes roads, rivers, woods, mountains, beaches, and cities.

The Red Capital is on an island and can only be reached across one of several bridges or by an amphibious invasion.&#10;&#10;Game features include special functions for headquarters units, terrain effects, invasions, airborne assaults, weather effects, replacements, isolation, and even nuclear weapons. Units represent infantry (25 per side), armor (6), mountain (2), airborne (2), headquarters (1+2+4), and amphibious troops (2) and 6 counters without symbol (You can use as replacement for headquarters having fired their nuclear missile; the 3 types of headquarter have different nuclear missiles). 100 counters in all.&#10;&#10;TACTICS II was almost always part of the Avalon Hill game line, primarily because it was sold as an introductory wargame for a number of reasons. The rules introduced many basic board wargaming concepts and were relatively low in complexity. The rulebook is divided into a basic game and a tournament game (advanced game). Both are balanced and relatively quick playing. As the opposing armies are identical in size and composition, victory is gained by a combination of logic, foresight, luck, common sense, and skill in military strategy and tactics.&#10;&#10;In 1981, an unauthorized hex map version, called Opera&#195;&#167;&#195;&#163;o MX-1, was released in Brazil.

1577;Source of the Nile;"Designed to be an educational and challenging game in which players compete primarily with Nature and with each other, luck tends to be an element in the game, but can be overcome by careful play. Because the situation is forever changing, there is no single best strategy; however,players must weigh risks against gains with every decision they make and good judgment will pay off.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a mapboard showing Africa from Khartoum to Capetown and Lagos to Mombasa. The periphery of this map, showing the territory known ca. 1820, is filled-in; the center is blank. A hexagonal grid is superimposed on the map to regulate movement and to delimit territory explored. In the course of play, each player moves a token (representing his explorer) from explored hexagons to blank hexagons one at a time.; terrain, native tribes and other discoveries within the hexagons are then semi-randomly determined, with allowance made for previous discoveries in adjacent hexagons. The player interacts with the discoveries (e.g. negotiates with new natives for guides) and records them on the mapboard using wax crayons. The mapboard surface is erasable. If the explorer dies before returning to Europe to publish his discoveries, all hexagons which only he has explored will be erased and &quot;subsequent explorers will find that his discoveries were only rumors&quot;; i.e., when other players explore the erased hexagons later they will have to generate new discoveries there.&#10;&#10;When explorers do return to civilization, however, they may publish their discoveries, after which they are safe from erasure. Players may also emulate real explorers by withholding some of their discoveries since they will enjoy some advantages when moving through terrain or dealing with natives known only to them. Points are scored for discoveries as they are published and once scored will not be lost if the explorer dies or is retired by his player. A player may retire his explorer at any time and then start a new explorer in Europe.&#10;&#10;Before each trip to Africa, explorers will have to raise money to support their expedition. New explorers with no discoveries to their credit must do this by drawing chance cards for several turns until they feel their finances are adequate. Experienced explorers can accelerate this process by publishing discoveries, which allow them to draw additional chance cards.&#10;&#10;Originally published by Discovery Games and re-published by Avalon Hill as a more card-based rather than dice-based system.

1578;RoadKill;"Description text from the back of the game-box:&#10;&#10;Cross-Country Demolition Racing in the 21st Century (or &quot;Armored Leapfrog&quot; as its adherents refer to it) brings visions of Mad Max in all his infinite glory to your tabletop in an easily played card game format. Each player competes in an armored racer equipped with an assortment of &quot;accessories&quot; not commonly found in your average Auto Parts store. Road hog won't let you pass? No problem&hellip; debate the right of way with a burst of your front machine-guns. Annoyed by that tailgater? &hellip;a few well-timed grenades should scrape him off your bumper. Reckless passer? &hellip;well, if your smoke screen doesn&rsquo;t discourage him, a nudge from your scythe-blade hubcaps should do the job. And these are just the &quot;standard&quot; accessories. In the Advanced Game, you can customize your car into something even James Bond would envy.&#10;&#10;Running low on fuel &hellip; better pull into the next Rest Stop, but beware of sabotage or theft. Only losers nap during RoadKill. Besides, what better time to salt the track with tire spikes or change a road sign or two. Everything goes in Roadkill, an uproarious game of highway combat more vicious than the Santa Monica Freeway.&#10;&#10;Players vie for the lead so they may lay the next section of the course. For example, a player with a Nuclear Fuel Cell will want to lead the others on a merry chase through mountainous terrain to sap their fuel. However, someone already running on fumes will opt for a desert straight-away to finish the race before he must pit and relinquish the lead. But pole position has its price-attracting more than its share of misfortune, while slipstreaming provides opportunities back in the pack.&#10;&#10;As if the players don't heap enough mayhem upon each other, the game throws an endless series of monkey wrenches into play as cars breakdown, the road widens and narrows or comes to a temporary stop in a blizzard, rock slide, or drawbridge (or does it?). You never know what is around the bend in Roadkill.&#10;&#10;";1993;5.9137;2.3947
1579;Wrasslin';"Wrasslin' is a quick-playing fighting card boardgame that simulates the rough and tumble world of professional wrestling. Wrestlers of varying size, skill, and disposition wreak havoc upon one another by playing various Hold cards to batter their opponents senseless en route to a quick fall or submission.&#10;&#10;Each of the 24 wrestlers has his own unique set of abilities (Strength, Agility, Skill, Weight, Recovery, etc.) that determine what he can do in that spotlit ring on your table at home. Using Action Cards depicting a variety of holds - both legal and illegal - you must use your wrestler's strengths to their best advantage and minimize his liabilities in order to overcome your opponent. Victory depends solely on your skill in using your wrestler's abilities and the Action Cards that come your way.&#10;&#10;Play is fast and furious; most matches last but a few minutes. This is a simple, light-hearted, yet challenging game - ideal for family or social events, and for those rainy days when the lastest ringside seat at the arena isn't available. Whether you are a fan of the glittering world of pro wrestling, or a skeptic, you've just got to crawl into that ring at least once.

1580;Legends of Robin Hood;"What red-blooded lad hasn't imagined himself fighting at the side of Robin Hood against the evil Prince John and the Sheriff of Nottingham? Cops and robbers, cowboys and Indians, Robin Hood and his Merry Men are all part of a young man's rite of passage from childhood flights of fancy. Long the stuff of screen legend, Robin Hood now lives again in a game format for the entire family.&#10;&#10;So come with us back to the greenwood in twelfth century England as our heroes Robin, Little john, Friar Tuck, Will Scarlet and Allan A&rsquo; Dale scour the countryside with quarter staff and long bow rob the rich and save the poor from the oppressions of nobles and clergy. Each player assumes the role of an outlaw clad in Lincoln green and tries to outdo his fellows in amassing the most gold by winning archery contests, recruiting stout yeomen, or robbing wealthy travelers. But beware; the woods are full of the Sheriff's men. Ambushes by Prince John or Sir Guy of Guisbourne could land you in irons in a castle dungeon.&#10;&#10;Play is extremely simple as each player maneuvers his band across the map using playing cards that both dictate the action and define the sequence of play with little or no reference to the rules. Yet, strategy is important. You can opt to stick to the relative safety of the woods and dine on the King's deer or don a disguise to sneak into Nottingham Castle to cudgel the Sheriff himself.&#10;&#10;";1991;5.77419;1.5143
1581;London Cabbie Game;"Armed with a cab you travel the twisted streets of London picking and dropping off fares.&#10;&#10;Each car has 20 points of movement each turn. Passenger cards with the pickup point listed are placed in 5 piles. Any player can pickup any passenger showing. When a passenger is picked up the player takes the card and a new card is turned over in that pile keeping 5 passengers available at all times. You can only have one passenger at a time. Upon picking up a passenger you also draw a destination card and you must drop off the passenger at that location. The fare is paid out from a chart that is very much like the payout chart in Rail Baron. Fares also pay out a small tip. Once a player has obtained 3 pounds (it's a British game) he can add another cab but you still have only 20 movement points to use.&#10;&#10;The very large board is a true maze of one way and two-way streets. Cabs cannot move through other cabs and this can block streets that only have one lane. There are also 2 traffic jams placed each turn that block areas from movement and this also adds to the mayhem. Because of this the second cab can come in handy as it can allow you to use your full 20 points each turn but it will add to the congestion.&#10;&#10;The victory conditions are left up to the players. &quot;The winner is the player with the most money earned in a specified time. Say an hour and a half, or two hours. Or a money limit can be set on the game. The first player to make 15 (pounds) or 20, being the winner.&quot;&#10;&#10;";1971;5.85151;1.1667

This retains the system wide standard ground movement allowances and movement point costs. Air unit ranges have been doubled (to reflect raw range) as they are not affected by the time scale change. Land units represent Brigades, Regiments, Battalions, Companies &amp; KamfGruppes.&#10;&#10;The game includes a few shorter scenarios plus several different start-dates for the campaign games, based on the various critical events of the campaign. &#10;Playing time can be a couple of hours for the shorter scenarios, but as with all the OCS games the real money is in the various campaigns, which - while quite manageable on the scale of these things - still can take from one to two full weekends to play to completion.&#10;&#10;This is certainly the most rules-intensive of all the OCS games with air, ground, and naval units (including aircraft carriers!), airdrop capability on both sides, and the invasion and naval supply transport rules.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1/4 week&#10;Hex: 2.5 miles / 4 Km&#10;Units: Company to Corps&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;Two 22 x 34&quot; full-color maps&#10;Five dual-side printed countersheets (1,540 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 40-page OCS v2.0i system rules booklet&#10;One 36-page Sicily specific rules booklet&#10;Two OCS Charts &amp; Tables booklets&#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;";2000;7.75517;4.0
1583;Barbarossa: Army Group Center, 1941;"Historical Setting&#10;June 1941 -- Army Group Center hurls itself through the Soviet border defenses, and its two Panzer groups race headlong toward Minsk. Behind them lie the remnants of the Soviet Western Front -- almost a million men in four armies. The Soviets are stunned by the German Blitzkrieg. Their responses are slow, confused, and governed by pre-war contingency plans made obsolete by the speed of the German advance. In little more than a week, the German panzer spearheads meet east of Minsk. Though isolated units continue to fight, the entire Soviet Western Front has ceased to exist!&#10;&#10;The Germans' next target is Smolensk, but the Soviets resist more effectively. Entire armies are dispatched from other parts of the Soviet Union as the true scope of the Minsk pocket disaster and the magnitude of the German threat become known. Soviet counterattacks, especially around Lepel, are thrown back with horrific losses. Once again the Panzer Groups charge eastward, creating yet another huge Soviet pocket west of Smolensk. The Soviets resist savagely. Smolensk falls on July 13th, but the pocket does not close. Many Soviet units escape to fight another day.&#10;&#10;Hitler now makes a fateful decision and overrides his generals. Over half of Army Group Center's armored and air formations are diverted south to take Kiev or north to isolate Leningrad.

Most of the details of the campaigns are covered in a playable manner. Perhaps the most obviously interesting detail is the sequence of play, which is asymmetrical to account for the difficulties the Soviets labored under.

1585;Burma: The Campaign in Northern Burma, 1944;"Burma - The Campaign for Northern Burma, March-August, 1944, is the sixth game in the Operational Combat Series (OCS) from The Gamers, and covers covers the 1944 campaigns beginning with the Japanese &quot;U-Go&quot; offensive and ending up as what would be know as Imphal-Kohima, the most dramatic defeat ever inflicted on a Japanese army.&#10;&#10;In the spring of 1944, two equally matched opponents faced each other in the jungles and mountains of Northern Burma. During that spring and summer, three independent, but simultaneous, dramas unfolded. In the west, the Japanese launched an all-out offensive to capture Imphal. In the center, the Chindits landed in the Japanese rear area. In the east, the Chinese/US forces moved toward Myitkyina against stubborn Japanese defenses. These battles took place in horrible terrain under the most difficult conditions imaginable with troops whose quality ranged from the world&rsquo;s best to the world&rsquo;s worst.&#10;&#10;Burma contains British, Indian, US, and Chinese troops of varying qualities with ample opportunities for both sides to attack and defend.&#10;&#10;While mainly a British and Indian show, the campaign would end up involving US (Galahad) and Chinese troops as well. Burma is the most markedly different of the OCS games, with a wide variety of unit types and qualities, the extremely dense terrain and lack of roads creating a challenging supply situation for both sides, and a more balanced situation as both sides have opportunities to attack and defend. There is more of the &quot;cool stuff&quot; too, with Galahad, Chindits, Gurkhas, lots of air supply, elephant and oxen transport options creating some interesting situations, and the ever-enigmatic and unusual Japanese Army. Imphal-Kohima is by far the most interesting ground campaign of the PTO (from an operational perspective), and it's conversion to OCS is remarkably smooth, with a fairly modest set of game-specific rules.&#10;&#10;Unlike some other OCS games, Burma has an excellent range of scenarios, from a couple very short scenarios (1-2 hrs) through to a good selection of longer (6hr) scenarios and on up to 3 monster campaign games (30-60 hrs).&#10;&#10;Scenario Info:&#10;&#10;    Learning Scenario: 1/8th of Map B; 5 turns&#10;    Short Scenario 1 - Operation Thursday: 1/4 of Map B; 9 turns&#10;    Short Scenario 2 - U-Go: 3/4 map of Map B; 10 turns&#10;    Short Scenario 3 - Merril's Marauders: 3/4 map, but requires both maps to play; 24 turns&#10;    Short Scenario 4 - Sato's Dilemna: 1/2 map of Map A; 11 turns&#10;    Short Scenario 5 - Imphal: 1/2 map of Map A; 17 turns&#10;    Campaign Scenarios 1, 2, and 3 (which use both maps, obviously); 45, 41, and 31 turns respectively&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 1/2 week&#10;Hex: 5 miles / 8 Km&#10;Units: Battalion to Division&#10;&#10;Game Inventory (Burma II - printed 2008):&#10;Two 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheets&#10;Three dual-side printed countersheets (2 combat, 1 markers - 840 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 48-page OCS version v4.0 rules booklet&#10;One 40-page Burma II specific rules booklet&#10;Two 4-sided OCS v4.0 Charts &amp; Tables booklets&#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;Players: 1 or more (also suitable for solitaire and team play)&#10;Playing Time: 1 to 60 hours&#10;Complexity: High&#10;Solitaire Suitability: Moderate&#10;&#10;";1999;7.85034;4.0

1588;Bauernschlau;"The theme of this game is building sheep farms. Each farmer (player) owns a farm consisting of hexes radiating out from the center of the board, and whose boundaries (and therefore, sizes) are initially undefined. The placement of fences -- each of which is shared by the two surrounding farms -- defines the boundaries. Some hexes are clearly going to be in certain farms; others will be fought over (either to acquire or avoid!) fiercely.&#10;&#10;The goal is to complete one's own farm by having the fences on both its sides reach the outer edge of the board before the game ends (without which one cannot win), and to have the most enclosed points among all such completed farms (which wins).&#10;&#10;The sheep are on thick cardboard disks, printed on one side with values ranging from 5 (the best) down to -3. One sheep can fit onto each board hex.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player gets to do one of several actions:&#10;&#10;1) place a sheep blindly from the supply face-down onto an empty board space after secretly looking at it; 2) turn up a face-down sheep tile in place (thereby freezing it for the rest of the game); 3) use the cool wooden sheepdog to blindly &quot;herd&quot; a face-down sheep from one hex to another, where it is then flipped up and frozen; or 4) lay a fence piece on either of the two fences surrounding his farm.&#10;&#10;Certain board hexes, symmetrically distributed, act as multipliers for the sheep that ends up in that space.  There are a few special situation rules and a few rules governing fence placement. There are strong elements of bluff and memory in this game.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player's completed farm is filled with pieces (either face-up or down sheep, or the dog). Whoever has the highest number of points on face-up sheep in his/her farm after applying multipliers is the winner.&#10;&#10;";1991;6.06458;1.6

Also includes other weaponry not commonly seen such as drones (homing missiles).&#10;&#10;Players allocate energy and plot movement before each turn, then move all of the ships simultaneously.  Weapons are fired at will during the turn (i.e., not plotted before-hand like movement).  Ships have shields and armor for protection.

1593;Down with the King;"Down With The King is a political game set in a fantasy world.&#10;&#10;Players are nobles who plot to overthrow the king. Players must cooperate to defeat the king, but only one of them can take the crown thus backstabbing is always a concern.  The game is played through various decks of cards.  Players strive to gain prestige and influence points so that they can recruit characters to their side.  They also use natural disasters, plagues, interrogations, and other political problems against their opponents. Of 19 possible actions each turn, a player can only perform 2, thus creating a tension and need for strategy. Player interaction is very high because players can perform actions during opponent turns and because nobody is eliminated early from the game. A player who is killed just misses a turn and then returns as the former player's heir, usually with revenge in mind.&#10;&#10;";1981;5.79886;3.0517
1594;Federation Space;"&quot;Federation Space&quot; is a strategic-level Science-Fiction board-wargame set in the Star Trek universe from the original TV series.  Players control an entire fleet of starships for one of eight different races of the Star Fleet universe in an attempt to destroy the fleets of their opponents.  In addition to a general melee or &quot;free for all&quot;, 26 different scenarios are provided that cover everything from a Klingon rebellion to the death of the Federation.&#10;&#10;Tactical combat can be resolved using the simple system included or the more detailed Star Fleet Battles rules, if desired.  This gives players the ability quickly resolve those conflicts that are unimportant or heavily weighted towards one side, and use the detailed Star Fleet Battles rules for engagements that are pivotal or very closely matched.&#10;&#10;";1981;6.42944;2.9091

1596;Nevo;"Nevo is a two-player strategy game played on a 7x12 grid.  Each player has twelve checkers on his side of the board.  On his turn, a player may move one checker one square in any direction, including backwards.  Each checker must always be adjacent to one of its teammates, or it is removed from the board.  The further a checker is advanced into enemy territory, the more it scores: the first rank is worth 2 points, the second rank 5 points, and the third rank 8 points.

1597;Streetcar;"Given a a secret set of stations and trolley line, players use tiles to build a common network of track.  They attempt to build a path that travels from one terminal to the other while passing the required stations.  After all their connections are made, a player may begin to race their trolley through the network. The first player to race their trolley from one terminal to the other and visit all their required stations wins.&#10;&#10;The game was originally published as Linie 1 by Goldsieber.  In 1996, it was published by Mayfair as Streetcar with different end-game rules and artwork.  Later, it was published by Olsen in Sweden as San Francisco, again with different artwork.  Some versions, e.g. the Finnish one, seem to accommodate 2-6 players.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.45619;2.0621

Mars raid to capture the Web Mind Generator from a heavily defended area near Nix Olympica's massive caldera. The Webbie revolutionaries are deep in their tunnel complexes surrounded by strong points and infantry. The raiders will use infantry, laser tanks, lifters and the tunnel blasting BOAR drill. If they fail man's future may fall to the telepathic, religion/machine Web Mind of Mars.&#10;&#10;OLYMPICA is the clever tactical creation of Lynn Willis. His future history of the Martian revolution of 2206 hinges on the crucial U.N. raid. The game is easy to learn, fast playing, and challenging. Like the other Microgames, it is ideal for beginners and fun for pros. OLYMPICA is the perfect game for those who've never tried science fiction games.&#10;&#10;Components for the game include a 24 page rules booklet, play counters, and hex gridded map of the Nix Olympica region.&quot;&#10;&#10;";1978;6.31393;2.2222
1599;StarGate: The Final Space Battle for Galactic Freedom;"SPI's Space Capsule game #2.  SPI seeing the popularity of Metagaming's Microgames started publishing small format science fiction and fantasy games in the late 1970's and early 1980's.  From the rulebook&#10;&#10;&quot;Streaming through the mysterious stargates, the power-hungry Virunian forces have wracked the Milky Way for nearly 80 years in the War of Purification.  Remnants of the civilizations devastated by the Virunian Tri-Ships, banded together in a determined coalition, awaited the moment to launch their counter-stroke.  In 2519 AD, the moment had arrived: the Virunians encounter their nemesis and, retreating headlong to the source of their power, find themselves dispersed and without their potent unified command.  Coalition telepaths, sensing the Virunian confusion, direct their forces to the Nullgate, arriving just as the first helpless Virunian vessels tumble forth from the stargates.  The battle to ensue will decide the Virunian fate in the galaxy.  StarGate re-creates this climatic battle using a stylized, semi-abstract system of movement that allows combatants to conceal themselves from one another in the various planes and dimensions created by the Nullgate.  Players use cardboard playing pieces, representing units of the Virunian and Coalition forces, to maneuver and engage in combat.  Simple probability charts reveal the outcome of combat and various game functions.&quot;&#10;&#10;";1979;5.8908;2.25
1600;Russian Roulette;"Each player selects a different doubles and places a marker on the board to signify that it is his. All players then ante one chip to the jackpot. The first player then takes the dice and rolls and continues to roll until he rolls a 7. Each rolled number is kept track of unless a 7 or doubles is rolled.&#10;&#10;If a double is rolled the player who has the double marked adds it to his score and must ante a chip into the jackpot. On a seven the total that the player has rolled is added to his score and a new round is started. If a 7 is rolled by way of a 6 and a 1 the player forfeits his entire score and must ante 1 chip. The first player to achieve a score of 252 or better while it is his turn to roll wins the game and collects the jackpot.&#10;&#10;The rules do not assign any significance to the jackpot so I can only think that it is supposed to be a betting game. The rules are provided in English and Spanish.&#10;&#10;";1986;3.25;0.0

Each rung of the ladder has a corresponding space on the outer (Monopoly like) track of the board and you must land on that space to progress.

You cannot land on a space occupied by another player (the only interaction) and there are the ever present &quot;chance cards&quot; here in 2 flavors, credit and society.

1602;The Royal Game of Ur;"The game has been published under different names but it is a simple race game very much like Backgammon. This edition has a board that is a reproduction of the original found in the Mesopotamian city of Ur. Each player brings their 7 pieces in to play and takes them off of their outer track. Opposing pieces come into conflict on the inner track that they must travel on to the exit. If you land on a space occupied by a single opponent's piece you send it back to the start. If you land on a space occupied by 2 or more opponent's pieces then your piece goes back to the start.&#10;&#10;The four dice give a marked or blank result. They are tetrahedral (four-sided) dice.&#10;&#10;Each die gives a &quot;1&quot; or a &quot;0&quot;. You can roll 0,1,2,3, or 4. Statistically, 2 is most common- a good thing to bear in mind. The rosette in the central track is a &quot;safe&quot; place from which you cannot be bumped, but you can be bumped on others. Landing on any rosette allows you to roll again, but you don't need to move that same piece.&#10;&#10;All moves must be made by one piece only.&#10;&#10;First to bear off all 7 of his pieces wins.&#10;&#10;Note - Rules update in line with guidance from Irving Finkel from British Museum.&#10;&#10;The game may be a relative of Senet and Aseb.&#10;&#10;";-2600;6.2224;1.2453

1607;Blurt!;"Players attempt to be the first to move their pawn all the way around the board.  Each turn a reader will read the actual definition to a word as found in a children's dictionary (so they're simple).  The first player/team to correctly blurt out the word that fits the definition gets to move their pawn forward the number of spaces rolled on the die.  There is no penalty for guessing incorrectly, so things tend to get a bit raucous!&#10;&#10;The player to the reader's left becomes the new reader and a new round begins.  If a pawn land on certain spaces or the same space as an opponent, a &quot;one-on-one&quot; contest is held just between those two players with the victor getting to stay on the spot and the loser having to move back to where the trailing player started.&#10;&#10;In Blurt!

1608;Ambush!;"from the back of the box:&#10;&#10;Ambush! is the solitaire wargame of combat, adventure, and heroism in World War Two France. Using a ground-breaking development of the programmed paragraph solitaire system, Ambush! gives the player control of an American squad, faced with a variety of missions against an ever-changing, hidden German foe.  The variable events, innumerable tactical options, and wealth of unexpected occurrences make Ambush! a solitaire gaming experience unlike any that has gone before. The easily learned rules are specially designed to get the player into the action within minutes.  The player selects and arms his squad, providing each soldier with command and initiative ratings, perception, weapons skill, driving skill, and movement capability. After selecting one of the eight missions provided, the player sends his squad into a mission map to conduct operations called for in the mission.  Soldiers move freely, as far as the player wishes, checking for events each time they move...until the sequenced action rounds are triggered by the whine of German bullets!&#10;&#10;";1983;7.51744;3.2553
1609;Creature Features;"Creature Features is a Monopoly-style game in which the players attempt to make a fortune through producing classic monster movies, using actual films and stars from the twenties through the early seventies.  The relationship to Monopoly is so blatant that at the start of the rules (and in the rules' largest font) is this quote: &quot;This game plays similarly to the famous Monopoly game.&quot;&#10;&#10;The board features a rectangular track with spaces for each movie featured in the game (akin to Monopoly properties).  There are also Tombstone Award and Dead or Alive spaces (causing card draws, as with Chance and Community Chest in Monopoly).  Finally, there are Ghoul Agency spaces that allow you to draw and purchase actor cards.&#10;&#10;As you travel around the board, you buy movies and acquire stars.  There are two actors associated with each movie and upon landing on a Ghoul Agency space you draw three actors for possible purchase.  You can attempt to buy any actors who are in a movie that you already own or, if none match, you may still choose to purchase one of the three cards drawn.  The price of an actor card is determined by a roll of the dice, multiplied by a base dollar amount.&#10;&#10;Completing a production (acquiring the movie card and both associated actor cards) requires other plays to pay you a fee if they land on the movie's space on the board (making the actors somewhat like adding houses to a property in Monopoly).  Also, having a completed production allows you to draw a card when you land on an award space.  If you win a major award, you place it on the movie and anyone landing there has to pay you a premium (similar to having a hotel on a property in Monopoly).&#10;&#10;";1975;6.76552;2.2
1610;The Worlds of Boris Vallejo;"From the 30 world tiles (each featuring a different painting by Vallejo) each player, 1 at a time, chooses one and places it so that it touches at least 1 other tile. This is done until each player has placed 5 tiles. This makes up the playing board.&#10;&#10;Each player then receives 8 cards from the card deck. Cards come in 4 flavors. World cards, which are not shuffled into the deck, have info about each world tile. The player who owns that tile takes the card for reference. Character cards have a base strength, class and a home world indicator. They can be played to a tile that you own as defense against attack. If they are played to their home world their strength is doubled. Scroll cards can be placed on worlds and used by characters that can wield magic. These cards boost the base strength. Artifact cards can be used by any character. They boost strength and sometimes have special powers.&#10;&#10;Each player picks a world tile to be his home and places 5 of their 8 cards there to defend it. Players also have a pawn that represents their army.&#10;&#10;During a turn a player first draws 3 cards from the deck.&#10;&#10;Second a player may play up to 2 cards. These cards can be played from his hand to a controlled world, from a controlled world to another controlled world or from a controlled world to his hand.&#10;&#10;Third a player may move his pawn 1 or 2 worlds. If he enters a world controlled by another player he must stop.&#10;&#10;Although not stated in the rules I would assume if a pawn is in a world not claimed by another player he could claim the world and play cards there. If a pawn is in a world occupied by another player you would then have a battle. A battle is fought between the cards on the tile as defense and the cards from the attacking players hand. Calls from allies can be made and other players can contribute to the battles as well.&#10;&#10;The first player to control 8 worlds wins.&#10;&#10;";1984;4.73939;1.8333

1621;Mutant Chronicles: Siege of the Citadel;"Precursor of the Mutant Chronicles miniatures Game and a kissing cousin of Heroquest stands Mutant Chronicles: The Siege of the Citadel&#10;&#10;Setting: In Mutant Chronicles, players control one of five corporations: Imperial, Cybertronic, Mishima, Capitol, or Bauhaus. Each player begins with two of their own unique Doomtroopers imbued their Corporation's special ability.  They make decisions and plan strategies to prevent the Dark Legion and its leader, the vile Nepharite, Alakhai, from conquering the solar system. Each successful mission brings a new one with the modular Citadel and events that can help or hinder you in battle. Each promotion gives credits to access more powerful weaponry!  Grab a Punisher Shortsword and Plasma Carbine to make your mark in the Mutant Chronicles!&#10;&#10;Gameplay:  The game begins by choosing which of the 5 players will be the Dark Legion Player for the current mission.  A player fulfills this role by setting their Doomtroopers aside for the current mission and controlling the enemies.  The Dark Legion player can earn promotion points for their inactive Doomtroopers by wounding the other player's Doomtroopers.  Thus, taking a turn as the baddies is not totally thankless.  10 different scenarios are included with the game.&#10;&#10;The Corporation players take their Player tray and 2 Doomtrooper miniatures, two Doomtrooper cards and a Secondary Mission card if specified by mission (these allow extra points if the requirements of the card can be met).  The Dark Legion Player sets up the current mission's Citadel layout with the modular boards and gathers his mission specified Force Cards.  The Force cards are deployed in rooms face-down and are revealed when a Doomtrooper enters and the corresponding Dark Legion miniatures are placed on board.  All miniatures may move 3 squares per move action and most figures get 2 actions per turn.  A figure can do one of the following: Move then Attack, Attack then Move, Attack twice or Move twice.  Corporation Players go first.  Order is determined by flipping over a face-down Corporation token.  The revealed player (Doomtrooper or Legion) takes their turn  and the next Corporation token is flipped.&#10;&#10;Play is semi-cooperative for the Corporation players as they compete for points, but want the overall mission to succeed.   The weapon card the Doomtrooper has equipped determines whether he can attack long range, close combat or both.  There are various miscellaneous equipment that can be equipped in addition to the weapon (healing kits, laser targeting, Grenade launcher etc...).  Attacks are carried out by rolling dice and comparing the number of hits to the armor value of the target.  If the number of hits exceeds the armor value of the creature it is eliminated.  In addition Doomtroopers can use a Doomtrooper card to affect the game in some way.  These cards list two effects but only one can be used per card and are then discarded.  The possible effects range from modification of combat or movement to messing with your opponents (jamming their gun for example).&#10;&#10;The Dark Legion(DL) Player at the start of his turn draws the top event card, reads it out loud and follows the instructions.  The DL player then receives the reinforcements listed on the card and places them on the board.  The DL player then looks to see if any Force cards are still face-down. If there are, the player reveals one and places the revealed units in the same room the card was in.  The DL player then takes his actions with all of his creatures.  Play continues in this way until mission is successful or the time runs out and it fails.&#10;&#10;Game End: Successful Doomtroopers receive promotion points for the creatures killed in battle and credits specified for the mission.  If they gain rank Doomtroopers improve the combat dice they use and gain extra actions.  With their credits Doomtroopers can purchase improved weaponry and gadgets (Gehenna Puker, Nimrod Autocannon).  The Dark Legion player's inactive Doomtroopers gain 1 promotion point per point of damage inflicted upon the opposing players' Doomtroopers by creatures.&#10;&#10;A rare poster-magazine called &quot;Sinkadus&quot; 41# &amp; 42# that was produced by Target Games AB only in Sweden, added an expansion to Siege of the Citadel.  It added to the base game Brotherhood Characters (Inquisitor Nicodemus and Mortificator Sebastian Crenshaw), new equipment, spells, and two new baddies: the Pretorian Stalkers. All the minis were given their own stats and paper models for representation.&#10;&#10;";1993;6.99734;2.2333
1622;Strata 5;"The Strata 5 challenge is to build and scale a structure that's 5 levels or 5 strata high. To do so, you must move your pawns and position building block playing pieces&hellip;and you must do both of these actions on every turn. As you and your opponent position blocks, move your pawns up the levels searching for the fastest way to the 5th strata. On each turn, you must move two pawns and position one block. If you climb with caution and construct with cunning, you'll move one of your pawns onto the tip-top strata first and win the game. When moving and building, try to trap the enemy pawns inside the structure, blockade them so they cannot move, or capture them and move them as your own. Strata 5 enforces strict building codes on pawn movement and block placement. But if you're &quot;level-headed&quot; enough to build, climb, block, and capture strategically, you'll reach the 5th level first!&#10;&#10;";1984;5.77171;2.3333

The attacks of each Pok&eacute;mon have a difficulty, and if you roll one of the numbers that make the attack succeed, the attack succeeds.&#10;&#10;A clever and simple system, the D6 system is a very good way to run some simplified RPG games with your non-dicechucking friends.  It goes great with games similar to Heroquest for those who don't like difficult rules.&#10;&#10;This game is also a great way of getting younger players into the gaming hobby and introduce them to RPGs.&#10;&#10;";2000;5.18462;1.25
1626;Krull;"From the rulebook:&#10;&#10;&quot;You and your opponents are battling to save Princess Lyssa from the Beast. (He's taken her from Prince Colwyn and carried her off to the Black Fortress!) You must capture the Glaive card. Don't let opponents take it from you! And locate the Black Fortress card, while keeping its whereabouts a secret from others. Once you have the Glaive and can expose the Black Fortress, battle the Beast and try to rescue the Princess. Defeat the Beast and you're winner!&quot;&#10;&#10;Based on the movie of the same name&#10;&#10;";1983;5.0407;1.4
1627;XXXenophile;"The xXxenophile collectable card game is a game based on introducing different people, places, and things and hope they &quot;pop.&quot; Based on the erotic comic of the same name by Phil Foglio, the game retains the humor of the comic, but the images are less explicit. Where the comic is definitely rated &quot;X&quot;, the card game's pictures would receive a soft &quot;R&quot; rating.&#10;&#10;The basic mechanic of the game is laying out the cards in a certain pattern face down, flipping one of the cards, and then attempting to match the edges of the cards with edges of the same color. Each card has a different point total, and the first player to 100 points wins.&#10;&#10;Each player brings his or her own deck to play, and the decks get hopelessly intermingled during play. Half the fun of the xXxenophile game is gaining cards that you did not originally have.&#10;&#10;The cards are not painted in an insulting way, are no more demeaning to women than they are to men, and there is material for people of all sexual preferences within the artwork. The game is still not appropriate for children by the standards of its country of origin (the United States).&#10;&#10;Cheapass Games&rsquo;s James Ernest, the game designer who designed Kill Doctor Lucky and Button Men, created the design for play of the game.&#10;&#10;";1996;5.80645;1.6522
1628;Elric;"Based on Michael Moorcock's Elric series, this wargame attempts to bring the various nuances of the novels together. War, politics, magic, and the balance between Chaos and Law are all simulated.&#10;&#10;While armies, as in most wargames, are essential, individual characters also play a vital role. Magic is also important as spell casting affects the cosmic balance between Chaos and Law.&#10;&#10;There are 6 scenarios provided for 1 to 4 players plus an encouragement to create your own.&#10;&#10;All in all a very faithful rendition of the books.&#10;&#10;";1977;5.80732;2.4737
1629;Air War: Modern Tactical Air Combat;"(from the box lid:)&#10;&#10;Air War: Modern Tactical Air Combat is a unique, ultra-complex simulation of almost every facet of modern aerial combat.  Thirty of the most important aircraft types to emerge since 1952 - from the Soviet Union, United States, Great Britain, France, Israel and other nations - do battle in historical scenarios from the Middle East to Vietnam, from Korea to India-Pakistan, and in various hypothetical scenarios that include World War Three.  The game is played on a geomorphic map across which playing pieces move through a hexagonal grid, which functions like the squares of a chessboard in regulating movement.  Probability charts reveal the outcome of various game functions.&#10;&#10;Contents: 48-page rules booklet; 16-page booklet of additional rules &amp; scenarios; 72-page chart booklet; 700 die-cut cardboard playing pieces; eight 8-1/2&quot; x 11&quot; soft map sections; and various play aids.&#10;&#10;Level of Complexity: Very High&#10;Average Playing Time: 2 hours&#10;Suitability for Solitaire Play: Very Low&#10;&#10;&#10;(BGG description:)&#10;&#10;At one point called the most complicated wargame ever. This modern air combat game has a scale of 1 airplane per counter, 500 feet per hex and 2.5 seconds per turn.&#10;&#10;The rule book is 48 pages long with 28 of those being rules. There is a large display for keeping track of each plane (4 per display) with a separate track for throttle, weapons, acceleration, turning at 5% increments, altitude and attitude giving each plane a true xyz position.&#10;&#10;Included is a 16 page booklet of 39 charts and tables. There are also individual sheets for each plane with info, charts and tables. There are also individual charts and tables for each type of missile.&#10;&#10;The game rightly suggests that you fly an individual plane around at first to learn how a plane operates before adding weapons. The game for all its detail is not without controversy as to realism. The energy rules and the claim that some aspects of the game are based on educated guesses because of the info on some planes being top secret, have caused this feeling of fudging.&#10;&#10;All in all one of SPI's most ambitious projects. There is also an expansion - Air War Update Kit.&#10;&#10;";1977;5.40991;4.6957
1630;Galileo;"Bit by bit, players reveal sky tiles that show 1-3 stars or 1-3 planets. Players wager on which will predominate. When the 4 planets nearest to a telescope are revealed, wagers are resolved. Though the game steadily progresses, it's not completely static, as face-up tiles can be replaced with facedown tiles drawn from a bag. A light memory game with a nice tactical element.&#10;&#10;";2001;5.5;2.0
1631;Barbarian Prince;"From the game box:&#10;&#10;Barbarian Prince is a solitaire game of heroic adventure in a forgotten age of barbarism and sorcery.  No opponent is necessary, as the Event Booklet takes you through a pre-programmed sequence of encounters which is different each time you play the game.  For each event, you, as the Barbarian Prince Cal Arath, must make the decisions which will make your quest successful - or may cost you your life.&#10;&#10;Barbarian Prince is a new concept in Adventure Gaming.  No rules reading is required; the programmed event sequence lets you begin play as soon as you open the box.&#10;&#10;";1981;6.67744;2.3548
1632;Shapeshifters;"Two wizards bent on killing each other have the ability take on the forms of a wide variety of different animals, some real, some mythic.&#10;&#10;Using replaceable spell points, the wizards change forms to get an upper hand on each other.  There is a cost for transforming and maintaining a form so it is not always best to transform to a large, dangerous animal.  Animals are rated for movement, movement type (flying, ground, diving), size, attack, defense, reflexes and special ability.  There is a flow chart showing cost of changing from one form to another.  The game is played on a hexagonal grid map.&#10;&#10;";1991;6.11378;1.5714
1633;Spies!;"Spies is a game of espionage and intrigue for up to five players, set in the turbulent European era of 1933-1939.  You control the secret service of one of the major powers of that era - Germany, Italy, Russia, France, and Britain - in the constant struggle to gather your opponents secrets and return them safely to your own capital while protecting your own country's secrets.&#10;&#10;";1981;6.45094;2.4524
1634;Warhammer Quest;"Warhammer Quest is the original game in the Warhammer Quest Series.&#10;&#10;From the Main Rulebook:&#10;&#10;In Warhammer Quest each player takes the role of a warrior, one of four brave adventurers willing to test their courage in the search for wealth and glory. Each hero comes from a different people. The Barbarian has traveled far from the savage north, a land of bitter cold and ferocious warriors. The Wizard hails from the cities of the Empire, the largest and most important of the realms of men. The Dwarf is drawn by the goldlust for which his race is famous. Dwarfs are grim and rather abrupt, but they are good fighters and loyal friends who remember debts of gratitude as readily as debts of coin. The Elf comes from the green woods of Loren where his kin spend their days hunting and making merry, protected from evil by the strange magic of their land. Elves are incredibly quick and agile, and they are also the best archers in the world.&#10;&#10;In the Warhammer Quest game the players enter a dark and forbidding dungeon. Together they must face the horrific dangers that wait for them. They will be attacked by monsters such as Orcs, Goblins, Skaven and Minotaurs. Other perils lurk in the darkness: scurrying venomous things like spiders, deadly pit traps, and decayed tunnels that cave in at the slightest touch. If they complete their quest the players will be rewarded with gold, treasure and artefacts of magical power. The more gold and treasure you can discover the better.., and the player whose warrior amasses the greatest fortune has done best of all!&#10;&#10;Warhammer Quest is probably unlike other games you have played. Rather than each player competing against the others, all the players must co-operate if they are to win. Also, there is no single board. Instead, the different rooms and corridor sections are clipped together to make a dungeon that is different every time you play. The game rules may seem a little complex at first - but don't worry a lot of the rules are designed to extend the game and are not vital to begin with. The actual game rules you need to play are in this book or printed on the various cards. The hugely thick Role-play Book is all extra and alternative material that introduces you to a whole new hobby of role-playing Warhammer Quest.&#10;&#10;- Warhammer Quest Contents -&#10;&#10;    4 Warrior models: Barbarian, Dwarf, Elf and Wizard&#10;    6 Orc Warrior models&#10;    6 Orc Archer models&#10;    6 Goblin Spearmen models&#10;    6 Night Goblin Archer models&#10;    12 Skaven models&#10;    3 Minotaur models&#10;    12 Giant Spider models&#10;    12 Giant Bat models&#10;    12 Giant Rat models&#10;    12 Snotling models&#10;    10 Dungeon Doorways&#10;    32 Page Rule Book&#10;    16 Page Adventure Book&#10;    192 Page Role-play Book&#10;    1 How to Play sheet&#10;    50 Page Adventure Record Pad&#10;    19 Event Cards&#10;    23 Dungeon Cards&#10;    30 Treasure Cards&#10;    17 Blank Event Cards&#10;    15 Spell Cards&#10;    4 Warrior Cards&#10;    4 Battle-level Cards&#10;    4 Equipment Cards&#10;    4 Warrior Counters&#10;    6 Dungeon Rooms&#10;    5 Objective Rooms&#10;    7 Corridors&#10;    1 Steps&#10;    3 T-junctions&#10;    1 Corner&#10;    1 Portcullis Marker&#10;    1 Cave-in Marker&#10;    3 Pit of Despair Markers&#10;    6 Webbed Counters&#10;    15 Power Tokens&#10;    10 Luck Counters&#10;    24 plastic shields&#10;    18 Scenery Markers&#10;    6 Large Dice &amp; 12 Small Dice&#10;&#10;&#10;";1995;7.50746;2.6901
1635;Demonlord;"Demonlord is a game of strategy for two players. It vividly recreates the grand sweep of empires in conflict in an age of sorcery and enchantment. Infantry and cavalry sweep across the land to meet in battle or besiege fortresses, as winged troops wheel overhead. Priests invoke friendly spirits, as magicians prepare potent battlefield magic, or summon great beasts to their aid. And controlling it all, the dread Demonlord, and the Captains of the Hosar alliance with their retinue of personalities and special powers.&#10;&#10;A print-and-play version of this game is available for free&#10;&#10;";1981;6.79613;3.0
1636;The Quest of the Philosopher's Stone;"A unique game that combines strategy with puzzle solving.  Players or teams move their pawn around the board trying to gain two wisdom cards for each of the four territories.  Wisdom cards are earned by correctly answering brain teaser questions from the Book of Challenges.  Wisdom cards, in turn, allow a player to obtain an alphabetical clue for that territory.  The four alphabetical clues, correctly unscrambled, form a word related to the medieval theme of the game.  The first player to correctly decipher the word wins the game.  The board also contains areas to help the players move around the board and/or interfere with the progress of their opponents.&#10;&#10;";1986;5.47778;2.3333
1637;Situation 7;"Situation 7 is a game in which two players or teams race with each other to put together the pieces of a puzzle. Each player has a complete puzzle which, when assembled, covers the entire playing board. The two puzzles are identical except for the background shade and the pieces of each puzzle are interchangeable with those of the other.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to win more points than any other player. Points are won by completely covering sections of the board which are outlined by black grid lines on the board and by covering special objectives that have additional point values.&#10;&#10;Sequel to Situation 4.&#10;&#10;";1969;6.22727;1.0
1638;Archimedes;"A completely different game from the &quot;Archimedes&quot; published in 1995 by egSpiele. The game is played on an 8x8 board, with each player controlling one King pawn. On your turn, you must move your King (as a normal chess king) and then place a pyramid on the board. Once your King has become completely surrounded by pyramids and cannot move, you are out of the game, unless there are two pyramids of the same color (there are eight pyramids in five different colors) leading out in a straight line from your King, in which case you can move the one closest to your King to anywhere else on the board, and then move your King into the empty space.&#10;&#10;Oddly, the box this game came in is completely devoid of any extraneous info (including game designer and year of publication), and even the manufacturer's initials are in tiny print with a &copy; symbol, crammed down in the corner of the cover. Even the rules for the game are printed on the back of the box (in English &amp; German) as opposed to being included on a separate sheet inside.&#10;&#10;";1981;4.88571;2.1429
1639;Archie Bunker's Card Game;"This is a simple Oh Hell! variant. There are four suits -- Archie, Edith, Gloria, and Mike -- of 10 cards each, plus two special cards. Players use their &quot;Ding Bat Tally&quot; wheel to predict how many tricks they will take that hand of 7 cards. If they're right, they score 10 points. You must follow suit if possible; if not, Archie cards are trumps. The two special &quot;Ding Bat&quot; cards, which are ranked 0 and 11 in the Archie suit, allow the trick's winner to give the trick to any other player, or keep it for himself, allowing for some opportunistic hose-age of one's opponents.&#10;&#10;From the box:&#10;A Message from Archie: &quot;In my neighborhood, we ain't much for playing Contact Bridge or cannestoga or any other leftist games, so we play my card game. Even Edith plays it, so ya know it's gotta be real simple to learn. Meathead plays it too, but he's got trouble counting so we gotta stop to coach 'im. I highly recompense this Ding Bat card game for all youse right-thinkin' Americans.&quot;&#10;&#10;The message comes with the following disclaimer: &quot;The above quotation from 'Archie' is printed the way he talks on the famous 'All in the Family' TV Show. It is not intended to be correct English.&quot;&#10;&#10;";1972;5.47188;2.0
1640;Blockbusters;"Based on the American TV show that ran from 1980-1982 (along with a brief return in 1987), and from 1983 in Europe with greater success. Played over a 20-hex game board, two teams (one having one more teammate than the other) compete to answer questions with the initials given (What E holds sandcastles together?  Electricity) and place their mark.  The team to connect top-to-bottom or side-to-side wins the game.&#10;&#10;";1982;5.43824;1.2857
1641;Bounty;"Bounty is a game for 2 - 8 players from 6 years of age and older. The goal is to make as much money - 'Dubloons' - as quickly as possible! Players start from Home Port as merchants and set out on a trading voyage. By throwing the die, they sail to exotic ports like the Pearl Coast, the Jewel Coast and the Spice Islands. When they arrive at a port they pay a trading fee and draw a card which tells them what cargo they have bought. Cargoes range from codfish and coal to precious spices, pearls and diamonds,!&#10;&#10;Players might also draw a pirate card while trading. They then have to decide whether to rob other players - or continue as honest merchants. Players could also draw a warship card - in which case any pirate who attacks them or anyone else nearby will be in for a nasty shock! The top card in each player&rsquo;s pack shows whether they are merchants, pirates or warships. Since they don&rsquo;t show each other their cards - no-one really knows what they are (until someone decides to turn pirate by attacking another ship).&#10;&#10;Players who are robbed can get their revenge by calling in the Navy and chasing the pirate down before he or she can reach Home Port! Things are made even more exciting by the &lsquo;Treasure Chest&rsquo; cards which players draw every time they roll a &lsquo;one&rsquo;. They then find out whether they have landed without any wind in the doldrums, - or been blown by a hurricane to a distant port, - or have found buried treasure - or other such twists of fortune!'&#10;&#10;";2000;5.42698;1.6
1643;Romeo und Julia;"A lavishly produced trick taking game themed around some play that no one has ever heard of. The three suits are hearts, Montagues and Capulets. There are also cards for sleeping potions, poison, stabbings. Players secretly declare whether they want the lovers to wed or to kill them off. (The lone Shakespeare card is in fact a bid towards killing them off...)&#10;&#10;";2000;4.755;0.0
1644;Tipp-Kick;"Two player soccer game using metal miniatures.  Players each have 1 field player and 1 goalie, and use a 14-sided black and white &quot;ball&quot; that determines the possession.&#10;&#10;The colour on the top of the ball determines who is next to kick. The kicker puts the field player next to the ball and releases its leg to kick the ball. The other player should try to block the kick with his or her goal keeper. After the kick the possession is once more decided and the same procedure starts all over again.&#10;&#10;";1921;6.52594;1.2245
1645;War of 1812;"(from Columbia Games website:)&#10;&#10;War of 1812 is an elegant strategy wargame depicting the Anglo-American struggle to control the Great Lakes and Canada.&#10;&#10;War of 1812 sets up in five minutes and plays in 1-2 hours. This classic game has been enjoyed by thousands of gamers for over 30 years.&#10;&#10;Unit types in this edition include artillery, cavalry, infantry, and navies.

1647;Spammers;"FROM the SESSION REPORT:&#10;&#10;Each player is competing to pull off the most lucrative scams. You do this by spamming mailing lists. The more closely related the mailing list is to the type of scam you're trying to pull, the easier it is to score.&#10;&#10;Scams come in 4 types - sex, internet, money and free stuff. The text and art flavor are quite wonderful. Of course the sex scams appeal the most - highlights were the Virtual Jellorama, Walter's Wankery and Disgusting Dog Tricks. If you're geeky, some of the internet scams are witty. All the standard 'make money doing nothing' and free stuff scams are there as well.&#10;&#10;You play scam cards in front of you (up to 5) and then play mail-out cards (spams) trying to lure people in. There are a number of mailing lists of various sizes in the middle for anyone to mail to, plus each player has some private mailing lists that only they can spam. The action is to play a 'mail' card, nominating both a scam and the list that you're mailing the scam offer to. If you roll a d6 less &lt;= the size of the list, you succeed, and that scam scores a point. If you roll way under (4 or more), your scam scores 2 points. Some lists specialize in one of the 4 scam types ... if your scam and the list matches, you get a modifier of +2 making it easier to score, plus the mail-out cards have modifiers between 0 and +5.&#10;&#10;Simple so far, but every time a mailing list gets spammed, it decreases in size by 1 (1 million thematically which equals 1 on the die) - these are subscribers getting disgruntled by the amount of spam they're receiving who leave the list.&#10;&#10;The winner is the first person to get 20 points across all their scams, or who gets a single scam of 12 points BUT it's only checked at the start of your next turn.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of 3 actions surrounding 2 decks - list cards and action cards. An action is pick up a card, play a card or merge 2 lists (making one bigger list you can then mail to). The action cards consist of scams, mail-outs or hardware cards. Hardware cards are played in front of you and allow you to break the game rules in a prescribed way (eg can mail other's private lists). Mail-out cards also list special effects which vary from mundane to wildly powerful but generally allow you to hose other players. When you play one, you say whether you're mailing or playing the special effect.&#10;&#10;To the game play itself. You try to get a mail-out going every turn (you're only allowed one) and pick a scam / list combination that gives you the best chance of scoring 2 points rather than 1 point. If you only get 1 point, you may well be falling off the pace. You're generally picking up at least one card each turn, and this can be a slow process as any special action needs to be read and understood to work out whether you want to use the card as a mail-out or for the special effect. So it's not the fastest game in the world. These hostage cards also make it a big hit the leader game. If you're going to make a dash for the lead have plenty of protection cards because you have to maintain your winning score for a full round before you win - everyone gets a shot at you.&#10;&#10;";1998;4.17688;2.0
1648;Kan-U-Go;"An old crossword card game from the 30s, I was given my copy of Kan-U-Go in 1975. It has small cards with letters and values, and simple rules for playing and scoring. But the cards aren't small enough and the game soon fills a table. Not bad, but it's obvious why Scrabble sells.&#10;&#10;Copyright September 10th, 1934 by T.G. Porter (Printers) Ltd., Leeds 9. My version has 58 letter cards plus two Kan-u-go wild cards ... my search of the internet shows no consistency in the number of cards quoted for this game (I have found quotes of 52 to 58), and in fact several used game sellers (who should know better) failed to quote any number of cards.&#10;&#10;My version of the game is for 1 to 7 players, as there are rules for a solitaire version, entitled &quot;KAN-U-GO -- ALONE&quot; (Crossword Patience).&#10;&#10;Unlike the version whose pictures appear in this file, my rulesbook is slightly different, it is not nor ever has been glued to the box top, the cards have blue backs of the same design as shown, and the box has a pseudo-marbelled finish in peach and gold.&#10;&#10;";1934;4.85;1.5
1649;Colonisator: The Twelve Planets' War;"A space war between two races. The goal of the game is colonizing the higher number of planets. The two armies contain the same units, but only a few units are already deployed in the beginning, so a strategical option is to choose which kind of unit are to be produced every turn. Transport ships are the way for the colonization, but they are weak and unarmed... Other units are Fighters, Cruisers, and Mobile Bases.&#10;&#10;The first edition published by International Team was Kroll &amp; Prumni; Euro Games cleaned up the rules for Colonisator.&#10;&#10;This is your basic two-player SF game of colonization &amp; war.&#10;&#10;";1979;6.12;2.4545
1650;The Lord of the Rings Adventure Game;"Milton Bradley marketed this game as a tie-in with Ralph Bakshi's &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; animated feature film. However, aside from the artwork and the piece names, the game only bears a superficial resemblance to either the movie or Tolkien's works.&#10;&#10;Each player chooses a character from the Fellowship. The object of the game is to have that character cast a magic Ring into Mount Doom. Along the way from the Shire to their final destination, players have opportunities to pick up *several* Rings. These rings may be spent to get past opposing creatures. However, to win the game, a player must have at least one Ring when they reach Mount Doom.&#10;&#10;Cards allow a player to move 1-3 clear spaces ahead, to defeat Orcs or Nazgul, to bypass the various opposing creatures on the board, or to traverse mountain terrain, dictate movement. Cards are also useful for stealing rings from an opponent, relocating Nazgul on the board, and other functions. Each player has a hand of 5 cards with which to play the game.&#10;&#10;Die rolling comes into play for fighting Orcs, Nazgul, Shelob and Gollum when you don't have a card to defeat (or escape from) them, or to traverse the mountains. A special die tells players how many turns they will be bogged down in a mountain space once they enter it.&#10;&#10;Card and Ring management afford strategy opportunities, while the rules remain simple enough (and the game quick enough) to allow the game to be played by a wide variety of ages. Despite its divergence from the main story, the game itself offers a measure of challenge that makes it enjoyable - far more so than it would have been as a simple &quot;roll-and-move&quot; game with a strict adherence to the movie or book theme.&#10;&#10;";1978;6.14805;1.9
1651;Vertigo;"You head an industrial nation and must look after your citizens' welfare.  You must develop your country as fast or faster than your competitors ---but the price to pay is pollution, which affects every one.  The players must negotiate with each other through the United Nations' Council and agree on how to develop their countries.&#10;The winner is the country with the most industrial plants at the end ---if there is a winner!&#10;&#10;The rules are simple and there is no clear winning strategy.  There is some downtime during other players' turns, but Vertigo should nevertheless be a solid addition to your game library.&#10;&#10;";1990;6.40762;2.2222

That's the atmosphere.  The Casbah is a maze of tortuous passages including narrow one-ways and barred gates.  The police patrols it, but that won't stop us international spies/thieves, will it?  You wander the Casbah, grab the precious stones and bring them back out.  Running will get you there faster --but it tips off the police!&#10;Each player has one rule he may disregard.

1655;Drinkers Wild;"&quot;100% Proof Spoof for Liver-Rated Adults&quot;&#10;Originally published by Gamma Two in 1978.&#10;Although superficially similar to Smokers Wild, it is an inferior game, close to a Monopoly reskin. You roll and move, buying bottles. When a player lands on an owned bottle, he pays to drink from it. If you own all four bottles of one colour (four colours in all), prices double. The Pub Crawl is a separate inner track that you enter from four outer Pub spaces. While on a Pub Crawl, you don't collect from your bottles.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    Smokers Wild&#10;    Lovers Wild&#10;&#10;&#10;";1978;3.5;1.0
1656;Smokers Wild;"In this anti-smoking game, the players try to accumulate money while avoiding addiction to cigarettes.  At the start of the game, each player picks a profession likely to benefit from the smoking of others (Doctor, Undertaker, etc.) and then starts moving around the board.  If a player lands on an advertising space, there's a chance that he or she will begin smoking.  When a smoker ends up sharing a space with another player, there's a chance he'll pawn one of his brand habits to him.  The more a player smokes, the faster they advance on the Life-O-Metre, which ends with death.  The game ends once the first player dies (in the short game) or when only one player remains alive (in the longer game).&#10;&#10;The game is extremely simple to play and is filled with all kinds of horrible (but sometimes amusing) puns.  The game's claim that it has the power to cause smokers to quit and to discourage people from ever picking up the habit is rather questionable, but since it's easy enough to be played by young children, its anti-smoking message might actually be able to reach an audience that hasn't heard it all before.  Unfortunately, the game's simplicity may well work against it; for some players, once all the jokes have been heard (and there aren't all that many), there's really not much reason left to play the game.  On the plus side, there's a lot of player interaction as your profession gets called upon or when you pass your cigarettes to another.&#10;&#10;Smokers Wild seems related to Drinkers Wild so it may have been originally published by Gamma Two.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    Drinkers Wild&#10;    Lovers Wild&#10;&#10;&#10;";1978;4.99881;1.1818

The Beer is a source of power and strength for those who drink it.  You are the head one of the six great pig clans; you must impose your Beer recipe and thus become the most powerful pigs in the Universe!&#10;You will have to fight, negotiate, cheat, corrupt...&#10;&#10;Space Pigs is a humorous game of conquest which freely borrows from Star Wars, Dune, and all those SF chestnuts.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.50579;2.0
1658;Police State;"&quot;A game of strategy, survival, power and wealth&quot;&#10;&#10;This is a sort of &quot;communist Monopoly&quot;.  The players go around the board, but which leg of the board they're allowed on depends on how far they've risen in the hierarchy yet.  The most visible status symbol is your apartment size --and the competition for the one and only full-size Dacha can be ferocious.  There are a number of other status perks, such as use of the State Car.  All in all, a very amusing game that actually does capture a fair amount of the flavour of life in the communist USSR before its fall.&#10;&#10;The game was invented by Harley Sachs in 1969 under the name POLICE STATE, and sold in England and the USA, even as far as Ireland and South America.  It was copyrighted, patented, and published by the IDEA DEVELOPMENT COMPANY (IDEVCO), licensed by Gameophiles and later by the L.A. Producers' Partnership under the name COMRADES.&#10;&#10;It got his second name COMRADES from a BBC documentary series (1983-84), which aired in 1986 in the US. The documentary was about the life of ordinary Soviet citizens, which got interviewed by the producer Richard Denton.&#10;&#10;";1976;5.3;1.0

1660;The Cattlemen;"&quot;An exciting land-grabbing, claim-jumping game of the Old West, pitting one land baron against another&quot;&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to take over all the land and industries in the Old West.&#10;&#10;The map is divided into &quot;claims&quot;, which are states (or parts of states) grouped into various industries (timber, gold, oil, farming, cattle...) or railroad spurs.  There are 32 claims in all.&#10;In the first phase of play, each player stakes one claim (including claims already staked by that player or another one), until all claims have at least one stake on them.  After that, each player collects money based on any one claim he owns, and uses that money to reinforce his existing claim(s) or to jump another player's claim.  This process continues until one player has forced all other off the board.&#10;&#10;";1977;3.98444;2.0

1662;NapolÃ©on: The Waterloo Campaign, 1815;"On June 18, 1815, one of the most decisive battles in military history was fought in Belgian fields twenty miles southeast of Brussels. Within a short 100 days, Napoleon, former emperor of France, had returned from exile on the island of Elba, again seized power, quickly assembled an army, and marched to defeat the dispersed British and Prussian armies now preparing to invade France.&#10;&#10;Napoleon invaded Belgium on June 15th, defeated the Prussians at the Battle of Ligny on the 16th and after a day of pursuit, faced the British and Dutch army commanded by Wellington. Aided by superb defensive tactics and the timely arrival of Prussian reinforcements, Wellington defeated the French in the great Battle of Waterloo, ending forever the military ambitions of the great Napoleon.&#10;&#10;Highlights:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Mapboard which is a color map of southern Belgium. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Wooden Blocks as counters provide step-reduction and fog of war with no muss or fuss &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Two or three player game - Napoleon can be played by two or three players. With three, the allied side has two players, one British and one Prussian, and some special rules apply. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Note that there are essentially three different versions of the game which means that the rules are somewhat different. Key Differences in the various editions:&#10;         1st and 2nd edition had 48 blocks--shorter (60+ min.) play time -- vs.-- 3rd edition has 84 blocks--more accurate division level&#10;          3rd edition had Bl&uuml;cher, Napoleon, and Wellington leader blocks that give slight combat and movement bonuses. Although units have increased nearly two fold, the 3rd edition map remains same size, leading to overcrowding.&#10;          4th edition has 56 blocks and a larger map - play time is usually 90 minutes or less.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;";1974;7.37284;2.4699
1663;Clue: Dungeons & Dragons;"Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Who killed the Archmage? Was it Tordek in the Dragon's Lair with the Flaming Battle Axe? Or Mialee in the Dungeon with the Staff of Power?&#10;&#10;In Clue: Dungeons &amp; Dragons, a group of heroic adventurers has been called to the Archmage's castle, but one of those heroes isn't who he appears to be; one of the heroes is a doppelganger, a monster that can look like anyone! In the darkest part of the night, the doppelganger kills the Archmage, triggering a spell that seals the castle until the monster is caught. Now, in the grand tradition of Clue, the six suspects must determine which one of them is the doppelganger: Regdar the Human Fighter, Tordek the Dwarf Fighter, Lidda the Halfling Rogue, Mialee the Elf Wizard, Ember the Human Monk or Nebin the Gnome Wizard. The heroes try to figure out Who killed the Archmage, Where the crime occurred, and Which magical weapon was used.&#10;&#10;For the most part, gameplay in Clue: Dungeons &amp; Dragons is identical to standard Clue as players roll a die, move into different locations on the game board, then make accusations against a particular combination of who/where/which cards and a particular opponent; if that opponent holds one of those cards, she must reveal it to you. Eventually someone will narrow down the possibilities and make an accusation as to exactly which cards have been removed from the game; if correct the player wins, and otherwise she's out of the game and play continues for everyone else.&#10;&#10;One optional element in Clue: Dungeons &amp; Dragons is the Wandering Monsters deck. After landing on a &quot;claw-marked&quot; space on the game board, the player draws the top card from this deck, then battles the creature shown by rolling a die. If she wins, she gains a magic item that confers a single-use special ability, such as looking at a random card from an opponent's hand or taking an extra turn. If she loses, her token is placed in the center of the game board, from where it will take several turns to move back into a room (and get back into the game).&#10;&#10;";2001;5.90994;1.6875

1665;Airport;"In Airport, the goal is to create the most profitable airline. The players start with a fixed number of aircraft which they distribute among the routes on the board. They then take turns rolling dice and moving their counters around the board.&#10;&#10;When a player lands on certain squares, he is paid for all aircraft he has on a particular route. The more aircraft there are on a single route, the lower the payment received for each aircraft. For example; on the New York to Seattle route, one aircraft will make $40,000. If there are 5 aircraft on the route, then each aircraft will earn $15,000, for a total of $75,000. All players receive payment for their aircraft on the route regardless of who landed on the square. Other squares on the board require the players to make certain payments (such as landing fees or ground service charges).&#10;&#10;The players are also required to perform maintenance on their aircraft. Airport cards can be drawn which give individual players bonuses (such as a mail cargo route) or penalties (such as a strike). The players also have the option of buying or leasing new aircraft or of selling old aircraft back to the bank. The first player to reach a net worth of one million dollars is the winner.&#10;&#10;This game is another variant on the venerable Monopoly game. The varying amount of payment based on the number of aircraft on a route is actually somewhat realistic, but otherwise it has about as much to do with how airlines are actually run as Monopoly does with actual real estate investment. But the flavor is good, and the game is interesting to play and reasonably fast. It can be seen as a foreshadowing of Avalon Hill's Air Baron.&#10;&#10;";1972;5.97073;1.5

This strategic wargame of ancient warfare allows the player, with a unique new solitaire system, to try an accomplish a lasting peace. All existing solitaire systems on the market have the player take one side for the entire game. Unfortunately this pits the player against a random system with poor strategic direction. In The Peloponnesian War you get to play both sides, pitting yourself against the best you can offer. If the game system is winning, the player is forced to continue with the losing side. Success, on the other hand, will eventually force the player to change sides and recover the losing side's fortunes. The duration of the war and the player's performance determine victory.

1682;The Challenge;"&#239;&#187;&#191;The Challenge is a card game of deadly combat and formidable magics. (It is clearly a knockoff of Mayfair's Encounters, though it never mentions that fact.) Action is fast paced and tension-filled as characters exchange blows, fire spells, and even attempt to backstab. It is the fantasy battle at its best. &#10;More than simply hack and slash, strategy IS the key to victory, with cunning and skill playmg a central role in your success. Game play is an exercise in diplomacy and subterfuge, as &#239;&#187;&#191;treaties and trickery can make all the difference between victory and defeat. &#10;While The Challenge is easy to learn (start playing in less than 15 minutes), it has a depth far beyond that of the typical card game. With its excitment filled, strategy oriented, fullthrottled action, The Challenge is sure to become a classic. If you always loved combat the best ... take The Challenge.&#10;&#10;Sequence of Play:&#10;&#10;The player who rolled the high die goes first. Play moves clockwise around the table. The player can either challenge an opponent, pass, or declare a defensive turn.&#10;&#10;&#239;&#187;&#191;1) Challenge another character by using a Weapon Action Card, casting a spell (Advanced), using a magic item (Advanced) or using a thief skill (Advanced) from one of your characters against another character in another party. Both Character Cards involved are turned face-up (if they are not already). Then the defending player may retaliate with any appropriate card or pass. The challenging player may then continue by playing an appropriate Action Card or passing, followed by the defending player, etc., until both players have passed or one of the two characters involved in the challenge has died. After the challenge is resolved, the player whose tum it is can move one of his characters from one rank to another, discard any number of Action Cards, and draw from the Action Deck(s) until he has seven cards. The player that was defending in the challenge cannot discard, but can refill his hand up to seven. It is then the next player's tum.&#10;&#10;&#239;&#187;&#191;2) Pass - Do no actions, moving of characters, or discarding of cards.&#10;&#10;&#239;&#187;&#191;3) Defensive turn - You can't play any Action Card that directly affects another party. Play party Defensive Cards (Advanced), allocate Magic Cards (Advanced) to characters, move any number of characters from one rank to another, discard any number of Action Cards, and draw up to seven cards from either the Weapon Action deck or the Mystic Action deck (Advanced). Remember, you can't do two defensive turns back-to- back.&#10;&#10;";1990;5.80704;1.4286

1686;Spy vs Spy;"The object of the game is to build tunnels to bombs and bring them back to your home base.&#10;&#10;The bombs have various effects hidden on their base.  The tunnels are built through tile laying, so each player (best played with four) digs furiously from his manhole in the corner towards the bombs, hoping to reach 'em first.  If you connect tunnels, then you'll be able to try to steal another player's bomb before he brings it home.&#10;The basic turn goes like this:&#10;First, you move your pawn to another tunnel tile.&#10;Second, if you ended up or started on a bomb, test (with a special die) to see if it blows up.&#10;Third, draw a tunnel tile (you have a hand of four) and play one.&#10;Finally, if you get a bomb home safely, read its message.&#10;In addition to the tunnel tiles, there are white, black and grey spy tiles.  They are used to block tunnel tiles (each tunnel tile has a little black or white spy drawn in its middle, so you can play a White Spy only on black tunnel tiles and vice-versa; the Grey Spy can be played on either).&#10;Spy vs Spy is not be to be confused with Spion & Spion, an entirely different game by the same publisher and credited to Alex Randolph .&#10;&#10;";1986;5.62533;1.4286
1688;Star Commander;"&quot;Star Commander is a fast paced game of galactic domination for two to five players.  Each player (Star Commander) attempts to construct a battle fleet of space ships while preventing by any means, fair or foul, the other commanders from building theirs.  To create a fleet and keep it requires careful strategy, bold battle tactics, and rapid assessment of opportunities as they present themselves.  All the techniques of power politics, bluffs, battles, and sabotage come into play as you expand your command to interstellar supremacy.  Good luck!&quot;&#10;&#10;";1983;6.3;1.0
1690;Unexploded Cow;"Europe. Summer 1997. You and your most creative friends have discovered two problems with a common solution: mad cows in England and unexploded bombs in France. You've decided to bring these two powder kegs together just to see what happens &ndash; and you wouldn't say &quot;no&quot; to a little money on the side, so round up your herd, march them through France, and set them loose behind the Cordon Rouge. If you're lucky, you'll come home rich before Greenpeace gets hold of you.&#10;&#10;Either way, there's something magical about blowing up cows.&#10;&#10;Unexploded Cow is a money game in which players are trying to collect enough points to win the pot. On every turn, you will buy cows and pay for special effects by putting money in the pot, then try to discover bombs with your own cows in an effort to take money out of the pot. All along, you will be earning points from the French as you liberate town after town from the terrors of unexploded bombs, and the player who scores the most points gets whatever's left in the pot.&#10;&#10;Unexploded Cow is best played as a series of short games, each of which takes about thirty minutes. The game is quite simple and very chaotic: You'll have a blast.&#10;&#10;";2001;6.07894;1.3618
1692;Spoons;"You pull from a regular deck of cards 4 of a kind for each person playing. Shuffle those all together and deal them out so each person has 4 cards. They can't look at them until the game starts though. Place spoons on the table (enough for all except one player). Position them fairly, so each person pretty much has the same chance to grab one. You have one person (this job rotates hand to hand) start calling out 'pass'. How you pass is to select one card from your hand, put it on the table face down next to the person on your right, then you pick up the card the person on your left put down. You keep doing this until 1) you get 4 of a kind or 2) someone else gets four of a kind. At this point you grab a spoon, and the person who doesn't get a spoon gets a 'pig' point. Once you get 3 pig points you are a hog. If you are a hog you have lost, but you can still be part of the game. Hogs can talk to game players, but if a game player talks to a hog they get a pig point. Of course the winner is the person left when everyone else is a hog.&#10;&#10;";1972;5.18903;1.0833
1694;Little Round Top: The South's Best Chance at Gettysburg;"The battle of Gettysburg was a huge struggle that locked armies of the North and South in three July days of bitter warfare which turned the tide of the Civil War against the Confederacy. Among the many small actions that made up this battle none was more important than the fight for Little Round Top, a rocky forested hill on which rested the extreme left flank of the Union line. It was here that the outnumbered 20th Maine regiment held off repeated Confederate assaults, turning back the South's best chance to win this battle which they could not afford to lose.&#10;&#10;Little Round Top is Avalon Hill's new game for two players which re-creates this critical battle. During a typical game turn, both players move their company sized forces over a map of the battle area, positioning them for rifle fire and bayonet charges. Fire and melee combat are resolved by a die roll on the appropriate Combat Results Table. Regimental officers and their command abilities are crucial for keeping the attack moving forward or the defense intact.&#10;&#10;Little Round Top comes complete with a colorful map of the battlefield, 100 cardboard playing pieces, and a short rules booklet.&#10;&#10;Playing time: 2 1/2 hours&#10;&#10;Complexity rating (from 1-10, 10 the highest): 4&#10;&#10;";1979;6.44866;2.6333

Now the strategy begins.&#10;&#10;Do you send your team to different floors so they can cover more ground or do they go together and back each other up?&#10;&#10;Do you join the fight already in progress or do you try to secure another area?&#10;&#10;If one of your team members is wounded, do you let him recover to full strength or do you risk it in the hopes of eliminating one more Mutant?&#10;&#10;Score a point for each room you explore, for each blood chip you get, for each Mutant you capture!

1702;Klondike;"Each player on their turn draws three wooden marbles from a bag. Black &amp; grey marbles are gravel, yellow marbles are gold nuggets. The player places the marbles on the riddle - a circular aluminum plate - and tries to &quot;pan&quot; the gold. Other players bet on their results, adding a bluffing element to the game.

1704;Attacke;"A game of strategy with bluff and tactics for 2-4 players whose object is to eliminate all other players.&#10;&#10;At first glance, this is a Risk knock-off. A closer look reveals a different game.&#10;&#10;For starters, each of the 42 lands can only be occupied by a single token, which act more as visual aids than as armies per se. Combat is card--driven, each player playing from a hand of five cards. There are Artillery, Cavalry and Infantry cards, of various values; you're allowed to play up to one of each kind when attacking or defending. Joker cards can substitute for any given type. You can play your entire hand of five cards if you wish, but you only draw two per turn, so this could leave you exposed.&#10;&#10;Treason cards allow you to take over a non-contiguous land; Desertion cards allow you to get army cards from another player. The Revolution cards are very powerful as they will take over an entire continent! Luckily, there are Counter-Revolution cards in the deck as defense.&#10;&#10;A refreshing change from Risk, and certainly playable in a lot less time.&#10;&#10;";1977;6.0;0.0
1706;UFO: Game of Close Encounters;"UFO: Game of Close Encounters is a low complexity Tactical level board-wargame themed on an Alien invasion of Earth.  The Alien player must land 5 of 8 available ships on Earth to win.  The Earth player, with only eight rockets, must defend or perish.  Movement is along orbital paths that form 7 concentric rings around the Earth.  Each player rolls two dice and moves one rocket or UFO the exact count of for each die.  In addition to the UFOs and Earth's rockets speeding around, the moon orbits the Earth destroying all in its path.  Combat is not dice based, rather players capture opponents pieces by landing on them by exact orbital move of one die.&#10;&#10;The advanced game adds dummy counters for the alien player and space stations for additional defence of Earth.&#10;&#10;It feels really more like an abstract strategy game, but Avalon Hill classified as a wargame simulation.&#10;&#10;The game consists of&#10;&#10;-two 8&quot; x 16&quot; map boards with 2 black plastic clips to hold together.&#10;-die cut counters (8 rockets, 5 space stations, 1 moon, 8 saucers, 12 decoy UFOs)&#10;-2 six sided dice &#10;-1 double sided page of rules.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 1&#10;&#10;";1976;5.12331;1.6667

1710;The Siege of Jerusalem (Third Edition);"Published by Avalon Hill in 1989 (for the Third edition).&#10;&#10;(from MMP's web site:)&#10;&#10;It is 70 A.D.  Dawn breaks on the combined might of four Legions arrayed on the heights of Mount Scopus, starting their methodical advance across the valley to the ancient walled city of Jerusalem.  Siege lines have been secured tight about the city.  There is no hope of escape.  The besieged must persist behind their stout walls or perish before a vengeful Rome.  Five grueling years of campaigning in Judea is now culminating in the Siege of Jerusalem.&#10;&#10;But the fortified city defies even the might of Rome.  The thick walls atop the steep slopes literally bristle with natural and manmade fortifications.  It will take all of Rome's considerable engineering skills to winch their war machines into position for an assault up the slopes to the city.  Only here in the north plain can the city's walls be taken by escalade.  The rhythmic approach of the Legions is muted by the rumble of the siege engines as an assortment of towers, rams, and artillery precede the maniples.  The distant walls seethe with the frenzied activity of an alerted populace as the antagonists draw near.  This majestic view is abruptly halted by the blare of trumpets which soon gives way to the cacophony of the clash of arms and screams of the dying.&#10;&#10;Morning turns to dusk before the walls are breached and the weary legions exact their vengeance.  The sky turns bright again, aglow in the reflection of a thousand fires as the northern outskirts burn.  But what price victory?  Another day such as this will break the Roman Army and only one of the city's ten walled sections has fallen this day.  They will have to find another way.  Shafts must be dug to undermine the walls or earthen ramps built with which to scale them.  It will be a long campaign.&#10;&#10;This is The Siege of Jerusalem...An epic battle simulation with all the trappings and majesty of a Cecil B. DeMille film spectacular.  Facing the greatest army of antiquity, the Judeans must rely on the stoutness of their walls to halt the unbeatable Roman legions and therein lies the fascination:  the immovable object vs the unstoppable force.  As Eliezar Ben Yair, leader of the Zealots, you must conduct a skilled defense of the city's ever shrinking perimeter - exacting from the Romans a price so terrible that they will be forced to lift their siege - or break out to continue your struggle for freedom at Massada.  As Titus, commander of the Roman army, you must decide when, where and how to renew the assault - gauging your troop needs against the progress of your siege works and the press of time caused by outside threats.  More than just conducting tactical combat, the Roman must formulate an overall strategic plan for the conduct of the siege.&#10;&#10;Vastly revised from its 1st &amp; 2nd edition printing from Historical Perspectives in the 70's, Siege of Jerusalem now boasts two-sided counters, a continuous combat system, a strategic interphase for conducting the entire siege, and the morale / panic rules so important in portraying ancient warfare.  An Introductory Scenario depicting the abortive assault of Gallus with the XII Legion three years previous allows players to learn how to handle a legion in a single day's play while training for eventual participation in the conduct of the epic siege.&#10;&#10;";1989;7.14477;3.881
1712;Showbiz;"In the game, players take on the roles of theatre managers and must hire performers that will bring in the most money from the public.  There are six different styles of performers, and at different times in the game, public opinion will favour different styles.  Public preference is determined by dealing out cards from a special deck.  The current opinion is always known, and a possible (but not necessarily accurate) forecast of future preferences is also provided.&#10;&#10;Each turn, public opinion changes (sometimes to match the forecast, and sometimes into something completely random), then players use a bidding system to acquire contracts with performers.  Once contracts have been negotiated, profit is calculated depending on how well performers match the public's desires.&#10;&#10;By the time twelve turns have been played (and possibly one or two turns sooner), the game will come to an end and the player with the highest score is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;The game was originally published by the designer in 1984 (or earlier).  Hexagames published a German edition (which is the only one that handles up to 8 players) in 1988.  Avalon Hill published their edition (with very minor changes) in 1990.&#10;&#10;";1984;6.07579;2.0
1714;Moonstar;"First was published 'Corona' (1974). Moonstar (1981) added planets and variants&#10;(variant number 8 is Corona, without sand timer). &#10;'Harun' (1984) is not new game, it is a rethemed copy of Moonstar! &#10;'Orbit' (1993) a new variation including the Corona variations &amp; Harun.&#10;Finally, Randolph recycled most of the game into his 'Rasende Roboter' ('Ricochet Robots') (1999) , although the course mechanism and the objective were completely changed.&#10;&#10;Quite possibly the first &quot;German&quot; game to cross the Atlantic...&#10;&#10;About the game (from the back of the box)&#10;&#10;Moonstar is a game unlike any other game for any number of people. All the action is governed by dice, yet there is no luck involved. The dice simply establish the situation. It is up to the players to act upon it. A game with endless variety.&#10;&#10;Playable by any number of people, from one to a hundred, Moonstar combines numbers calculations, memory, and quick-thinking into a fast-playing, action-packed, exciting contest of pure skill.&#10;&#10;The board represents the twelve constellations (stars) of the Zodiac and the playing pieces represent moons and planets. Each game consists of a number of rounds of play. In each round, the board and playing pieces are first setup by one of the players. Then the dice are thrown. A one-minute auction period begins. Each player may bid any number of times in the auction or not at all. Each bid, however, must be higher than the previous one. When the one-minute runs out, the highest bidder plays that round.&#10;&#10;The play of the round also lasts one minute. A player plays a round by placing one die on each moon on the, board and then moving that moon (and die) a number of stars equal to the number of the die. The die is then removed and the moon may not be moved again. This procedure is followed for each moon. The player must move each moon before the time runs out, or those moons which have not been moved may not move.&#10;&#10;The player's score is then totaled to see if he has made his bid, by scoring a number of points for each moon, depending on which stars and planets they have landed on, If a player makes his bid, he scores a number of points equal to his bid. If he fails, he scores nothing. Rounds are setup and played in this manner until one player has scored enough points to win.&#10;&#10;But this is only the beginning. Moonstar is actually twelve games in one. Game One is simply the Basic Game. Games Two-Twelve each change one or more parts of Game One, or add something to it. They introduce things like challenging bids, side bets, more moons, more dice, different planet values, no planets. and advanced scoring methods.&#10;&#10;Includes:&#10;&#10;    16&quot; x 16&quot; gameboard&#10;    15 moon pieces&#10;    21 planet pieces&#10;    1 minute sand timer&#10;    11 6-sided dice&#10;    rulebook&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Corona&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Orbit&#10;    Ricochet Robots&#10;&#10;&#10;";1981;5.18096;1.75
1716;Knights of the Air;"[From the back of the Avalon Hill game box]&#10;&#10;They were a part of Europe's &ldquo;next Generation&rdquo;, asked to march to war before they had tasted of life's joys and sorrows.&#10;&#10;They were cut from a special cloth, singled out to do a job that demanded intelligence, endurance, steadiness and coordination of the highest order.&#10;&#10;They dueled to the death in fragile machines, only just invented ten years before, miles above the earth.&#10;&#10;They were brave soldiers to their comrades in arms and heroes to their public.&#10;&#10;They were the fighter pilots of the Great War &ndash; THE KNIGHTS OF THE AIR.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill's game, KNIGHTS OF THE AIR, recreates the deadly combat of the World War I air war.  You learn to fly the great airplanes of the period much in the same way the Aces did &ndash; rig in the cockpit using control stick, throttle and rudder pedals.  Each kind of warplane included in the game has been carefully researched to present the same strengths, weaknesses and idiosyncrasies it demonstrated in real life.  Once you have learned the tricks of your aircraft, you can dare to risk all in a dogfight.  Air combat is conducted in a series of maneuvers as each pilot tries to position his plane for the killing run.  With experience, new and more complicated maneuvers become available so that the ace can barrel roll and loop rings around the novice.  Your success will depend upon your ability to master your plane and to exploit the weaknesses of your enemy's.&#10;&#10;Some Features:&#10;- Your Abilities to improve with experience, An Ace can react quicker, aim his gunfire more accurately, and undertake more complicated maneuvers than a novice can.&#10;&#10;- Each kind of airplane in the game has been designed to perform just like its real-life counterpart.  Rates of climb and dive, maximum and stall speeds, and turning abilities all compare favorably with test flight results.&#10;&#10;-You guide your airplane on the gameboard using real controls.  You adjust speed with the control stick and the rates of dive and climb with the throttle.&#10;&#10;- Special attention was directed, during the design, to develop a simple method of allowing one plane to tail another.  The reflexes of both airplane and pilot are a crucial factor in this procedure.&#10;&#10;- With the wide choice of airplanes included, a practically unlimited variety of dogfights may be staged.  Many of the greatest warplanes are there the Sopwith Camel, SE 5a, SPAD, Nieuport, Bristol Fighter, Fokker Triplane, Fokker DVII, Albatros, Pfalz, Roland and more.&#10;&#10;- Special solitaire scenarios have been created to restage attacks against Zeppelin airships and two-seater warplanes.&#10;&#10;Complexity: Medium&#10;Solitaire Suitability: High&#10;&#10;Each game contains:&#10;- A 22&rdquo;x32&rdquo; full-color gameboard depicting a section of trenchline on the Western Front.

1718;Foreign Exchange;"From the back of the box:&#10;&#10;At last - a money game for adults!&#10;&#10;Be forewarned!  This game might not be for you...unless you are a student of the international money market.  Or, you are just plain curious as to why the US dollar is worth less and less despite the fact that we are still the strongest nation in the world.&#10;&#10;Simply put, Foreign Exchange is not a toy.&#10;&#10;A perfect simulation of the international currency situation, it is!&#10;&#10;International companies realize gains and losses when changing currency rates alter the value of their income and assets in foreign countries.  This game simulates this situation by letting players own and manage multi-national companies in various cities throughout the world.  As in the real world, changing conditions require each player to make constant decisions after considering his company's financial resources - and what he expects his opponents to make - against the cost of alternative protective strategies.&#10;&#10;The Iranian oil situation of early '79 is a classic real-life example.  Iran furnishes less than 7% of America's petroleum needs.  Yet its unavailability has done more to devalue the dollar against gold than any economic crises since the depression of 1939. Why so, you may ask.&#10;&#10;Playing Foreign Exchange will give you insight into this question, and you'll have fun doing so because the game focuses on the interplayer relationships.  Without such interplay relationships, no game is fun to play.  With it, Foreign Exchange might just be the greatest money game to come along since Monopoly.&#10;&#10;Ironically, it doesn't come with any money.  All financial transactions are recorded on a variety of accounting pads included.  If you're into pencils, you'll love this game (some enterprising money -market enthusiasts have already programmed this game on computer).&#10;&#10;You - as company head - decide where in the world (literally) you want to establish sales and manufacturing offices.  This is done at the beginning through a round of trading City Cards among players until everyone is satisfied they've outsmarted their opponents.&#10;&#10;From this point on, a variety of situations and happenstances will determine likely changes in currency rates.  You - the manufacturer - must plan the strategies you think best to maximize gains.&#10;&#10;Foreign Exchange was designed by a professional money-management expert and executive officer of the leading financial institution.  What is duck soup to him, however, might be unfathomable to the novice.  That's why the game comes in three versions: a &quot;Beginning&quot; version for game buffs intrigued by money games; the &quot;Intermediate&quot; game for those with a cursory knowledge of what's going on with foreign currency; and the &quot;Expert&quot; game for those people who really have a yen for this sort of thing.&#10;&#10;Includes:&#10;2-piece fold-out game board&#10;Foreign Exchange Worksheet pad&#10;Net Worth Worksheet pad&#10;Hedging Cost Worksheet pad&#10;24 City Cards&#10;4 Borrowing Cost cards&#10;16 Currency Exchange cards&#10;16 Risk cards&#10;5 player tokens&#10;40 colored markers for 4 different colors&#10;2 6-sided dice&#10;Rules&#10;&#10;";1978;4.4025;2.7

Eventually, Greg published a wargame based on his world called White Bear and Red Moon. In fact, Chaosium was founded to allow Stafford to publish this boardgame! This game later became the excellent Dragon Pass game. White Bear and Red Moon was enough of a hit to spawn a second war game, Nomad Gods, and, more importantly, inspired some D&amp;D fans to write a gaming system that would allow role-playing in Glorantha.

Tactical cards effect combat resolution which is dice based and cross-referenced on a probability table.  Roman units are divided into cohorts.

1724;Bureaucracy;"From the back of the box&#10;&#10;Bureaucracy is a somewhat less complicated version of The Great Chain of Being, a medieval, theological, parlor game, first uncovered in a small church in Urbino during the renovation of an ancient, holy, but clearly inadequate, sewage system.  Both the Church and the monastic Parkover Brothels deny the authenticity of the game.  As one official noted, &quot;that's a crock&quot;.&#10;&#10;Bureaucracy is designed to simulate the bureaucratic behavior which constitutes so much of what we call government.  It is convoluted, Byzantine, and entertaining.  It is also cost effective, feasible, and administratively impossible.  In its early stages, Bureaucracy required a fifteen story parlor, a six acre gameboard, 200,000 pieces, and a 15,000 page rulebook.  Of course, this prototype was unwieldy.  Consequently, we were forced to simplify the game.  The present version is good for two to eight players.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game at the lowest organizational level.  The winner is the player who rises up through the masses to become the Director of the Bureaucracy.&#10;&#10;Players may select one of four lifestyles, each with its own advantages and disadvantages: lifer, over achiever, empire builder, or hustler.  To be promoted from level to level, a player will need the required number of promotional prerequisites and that's where the fun comes in.  All sorts of things can happen.  Players may be demoted.  They may be involved in scandals.  They may become involved in power plays.  They may have to go before a Grievance Committee.  A player may even go bankrupt and have to start all over from the bottom again.  There is no one sure formula for success.  Players will have to stay out of trouble and use all their cunning to succeed.&#10;&#10;This is a game that makes being a part of the bureaucracy fun  It will make you laugh at government and yourself at the same time.    For civil servants, it's required recreation.  For just you and me, it's a must.  Don't be surprised though, when you open the box and hear the call of the jungle.  It's a wild game.&#10;&#10;Game includes a 22 x 24 gameboard, 2 dice, 240 promotional prerequisite pieces, 20 power play pieces, 64 player tokens, a pack of money, 80 lifestyle cards, 20 memo cards, 20 consumer goods cards, 8 bucks, 1 power file, and two rulebooks (one to explain what it says in the simple game rules)&#10;&#10;";1981;4.20179;2.25

1730;Trap the Cap;"An age-old children's game, for which multiple variants exist.  Multiple editors and editions.&#10;&#10;In the common version of the game, players roll the dice to move their &quot;caps&quot; around the board.  If a player lands on another cap or a stack of caps, that player captures the stack by nesting his or her cap on top of the stack.  A player then seeks to return that stack of caps to home-base to keep them.  The game ends when there is only one active color of caps left on the board.  In one version of the game, the winner is the player who captured the most caps of other colors during the course of the game.  In the other version of the game, the player who has active caps left on the board is the winner.&#10;&#10;According to Miscellaneous Game Book this was first published in 1927 by Otto Maier Verlag.  It led to many copycats, including two from Spears.&#10;&#10;";1927;4.95632;1.0909
1732;Bei Nacht und Nebel;"The players have to turn three times around the lake, but they ignore which compartments conceal traps. If the compartment is white, the player spends a turn, if it is red, he spends two. Otherwise, the player can move as far that he wishes.&#10;Obviously, it is necessary to remember the compartments of the board not to go back on the red compartments which were found by a player.&#10;A game of memorization, renewed in every game.

1744;Monster Mash;"This childrens game comes with 27 monster cards, 4 &quot;thwacker&quot; hands with suction cups, and a clever &quot;monster-maker&quot; machine. Each monster has one of three sets of eyes, one of three mouths, and one of three bodies. The monster maker consists of three panels that spin randomly, stopping to form one of the monsters. Players then scan the cards on the table to try to find the one that matches the monster. Whoever &quot;thwacks&quot; the right monster with their thwacker (a long-handled stick with a hand with a suction cup at the end) and picks up the card wins the point.&#10;&#10;The publisher's description:&#10;&quot;Imagine that you're a hunter in the deep, dark jungle.

1748;A Question of Scruples;"Scruples... The game that poses 252 moral dilemmas on issues of work, money, friends, family, neighbors and, of course relationships!&#10;&#10;User review: Each player is dealt five dilemma cards, each with a question of scruples, and one reply card. Each reply card says, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Depends.&rdquo; If the player can correctly match another&rsquo;s reply with a dilemma card from one&rsquo;s own hand, then the dilemma card is discarded.

1750;Knots;"Knots is an easy-to-learn path-building game. The object is to create a continuous rope from one side of the playing board to the other, while trying to prevent your opponent from completing his own rope connecting the other two sides.

Now all the pictures are mixed up. It is your messy job to find out which pictures belong together and which do not. But of course, the entire family will have to agree, and that is the tricky part. Just try and find an agreement that even your brother will understand....&#10;&#10;Kiek is a game of intuition and categories suitable for a group of three to eight players. It can be played for ten minutes or two hours, whatever you prefer, but be warned: the game keeps evolving, and it gets harder and harder to score points.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.45238;0.0

And did you realize your neighbour is the most popular guy in town? For now, at least. Because people are saying...&#10;&#10;Gossip! is a fast-paced card game about reputations. Players spread rumours, some bad, some good, in an attempt to be seen with the most popular people. Or, even better, to become popular themselves. Timing is all-important: that guy at the other side of the table might seem like a nerd now, but he might be Mr. Perfect in just two or three turns.

1758;Advanced Heroquest;"Advanced HeroQuest is a dungeon crawl related thematically to HeroQuest (which was a co-development with Milton Bradley) but mechanically wholly unrelated to that game.  While the basic concept of both is the same, four heroes venture into a dungeon to fight monsters and gain treasure, but Advanced HeroQuest's rules are more detailed and complex.&#10;&#10;The major additions and changes include:&#10;&#10;    fully solo playability&#10;    more complex combat system (role to hit versus target's weapon skill, then roll to wound vs target's toughness), including ranged combat, critical hits and fumbles&#10;    two phases of game play: exploration, combat&#10;    random dungeon generation system&#10;    modular game board&#10;    multiple colleges of magic and spell books&#10;    henchmen (in base game, as opposed to being in an expansion)&#10;    fate points (the &quot;undo&quot; feature)&#10;&#10;&#10;Games Workshop set Advanced HeroQuest in the Warhammer universe, presumably to foster sales of their miniatures.  The campaign world is easy to ignore, however, should players rather keep things generic.  Advanced HeroQuest also includes rules for using the characters and monsters from HeroQuest, should players want to do so.&#10;&#10;The game is supplied with Skaven figures that make up the quest within the rulebook. The exact same Skaven, henchmen and hero miniatures were also included in Mighty Warriors, also by Games-Workshop.&#10;&#10;The following White Dwarf issues contain adventure scenarios, spell lists, or other information for Advanced Heroquest:&#10;&#10;Issue #121     The Quest for Sonneklinge (scenario and Jade spell list)&#10;Issue #122     The Priests of Pleasure&#10;Issue #125     The Dark Beneath the World (scenario and Amethyst spell list)&#10;Issue #134     The Trollslayer's Oath&#10;Issue #138     Henchmen (new followers for AHQ: the Dwarf Trollslayer, the Elf Wardancer, the Human Captain, and the Wizard's Apprentice -- this material is duplicated in Terror in the Dark)&#10;Issue #139     Treasure (This material is also duplicated in Terror in the Dark)&#10;Issue #145     The Eyes of Chaos (has rules for both AHQ and HQ)&#10;Issue #150     The Changing Faces of Tzeench&#10;Issue #159     Rivers of Blood&#10;&#10;Advanced HeroQuest: Paint Set has replacement heroes and additional minis.&#10;&#10;";1989;6.8853;2.8764
1760;Fury of the Clansmen;"Fury of the Clansmen is a tactical combat game set in the Mutant Chronicles universe.  Players control squads of Clansmen or Dark Legion minions in various missions on the planet Venus.  Each side has special objectives in each mission, and the team that accomplishes its goals first wins the game.&#10;&#10;Includes 32 detailed plastic miniatures.  Can be combined with Pressman's Siege of the Citadel game to create very large battles. Additional rules and statistics for this game can be found in two supplements for the Mutant Chronicles RPG: the Imperial Sourcebook (with stats for many of the Imperial Corporation's forces), and the Algeroth Sourcebook (with stats for the myriad of forces available to the &quot;Apostle of War&quot;).&#10;&#10;Another expansion appeared in the Swedish magazine &quot;Sinkadus&quot; issue 43, which offered new squads for both sides, a new board, and a scenario using map boards from Fury and Siege of the Citadel together.  The Klansman player can now play as the Brotherhood faction, who use supernatural &quot;Art&quot; cards.  The Dark Legion player can use &quot;Dark Symmetry&quot; cards.&#10;&#10;";1994;6.48462;2.75

1768;Fireball Island;"A plastic tiki idol is placed in the raised middle of a molded, 3d board, where it can rotate freely. Players move their explorer pawns up the sides of the mountain along paths and through caves, trying to reach the top of the mountain, retrieve the idol's giant ruby, and take it down the other side to the waiting boat. However, both the idol and volcanic vents throughout the board periodically spit out &quot;fireball&quot; marbles, which physically roll down the mountain, either plowing through explorer pawns in their path, or toppling triggered bridges as they pass under them.&#10;&#10;";1986;6.44248;1.3358
1770;Aliens;"Aliens allows players to recreate three key battle scenarios from the 1986 science fiction/horror film.  The scenarios include &quot;The Reactor Room&quot; (nine marines vs. the aliens in their lair), &quot;Operations and Air Ducts&quot; (the surviving marines face an alien assault and pursuit), and &quot;Ripley vs. The Queen&quot; (Ripley uses a powerloader in her final battle with the Alien Queen).  Includes a 17&quot; x 34&quot; game map, character cards, and counters, all featuring photos from the movie.&#10;&#10;Marines can have very short life spans in this game, especially if they don't work together. Game play is fast and intense - does a good job of creating the sense of urgency felt when watching the movie. Missions can be made more brutal with optional rules - plus some rule variants add to some fun &quot;what if&quot; scenarios. Add the Aliens Expansion and you can virtually re-write the entire movie script!&#10;&#10;";1989;7.30321;2.2319
1772;Asteroid;"In Asteroid, one player controls a team of adventurers attempting to destroy a runaway mining asteroid on a collision course with Earth; the other player controls the evil computer brain that runs the mining station. The good guys must overcome the station's defenses (including various nasty robots), turn off the computer brain, set the asteroid to self-destruct, and escape before it blows.&#10;&#10;Each of the adventurers has unique characteristics, including ranged and melee combat abilities, computer skills, demolition skills, stealthiness, psychic ability, luck and even emotional attachments to other characters.&#10;&#10;The computer brain player secretly determines the configuration of the modular boards to form a map of the mining station and deploys robots to prevent the adventurers from shutting it down.&#10;&#10;Victory levels for the adventurers include World Survival Victory, Personal Survival Victory, Common Decency Victory, Romantic Victory and even SPCA Victory (involving the outcome with respect to the dog character, Sasha).&#10;&#10;One of GDW&#039;s Series 120 games, the game includes eight 5.5&quot; x 8.5&quot; maps and 120 tile counters that represent the characters, robots, items, etc.&#10;&#10;It was resold from Kokusai-Tsushin in 2003.&#10;&#10;";1980;6.64287;2.2609
1774;Sale of the Century;"Based on the game show, players are asked general knowledge questions and race to come up with the right answer. Right answers win money, wrong ones lose it. At several points throughout the game, players are offered the chance to buy discounted merchandise using the money they have built up. The catch is that no player knows just how valuable the item is, only that it is offered at less than full value. After fifteen questions, the player with the most money can either buy a more expensive prize with their winnings, or keep their money in hopes of winning again, and being able to buy something even better. After each person has had a chance to host, the player with the most money and merchandise is the winner.&#10;&#10;Two editions were made of the original 1969-74 series, although the first was reprinted (in 1971?) with an altered cover: one prize was changed to a TV, and the set shot cuts off the left side (where the host is) in favor of another prize.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;     Sale of the Century Quizzard&#10;&#10;&#10;";1969;5.57667;2.0
1776;Divine Right: Scarlet Empire;"Starting in 1997, Glenn Rahman designed an extension to his fabulous game Divine Right.  Scarlet Empire took place in a different period in that game's world, and further to the south of the original map.  It was designed as a stand alone game that could also be played in combination with the other one.  The campaign game pits most of the players against the one playing the Scarlet Witch King.&#10;&#10;If you liked Divine Right, you'd like Scarlet Empire -- everything that made the first game great is also present in the other.  Mercenaries, special locations, diplomacy, magic, etc.&#10;&#10;Scarlet Empire was supposed to be published by Excalibre Games and made it as far as the advanced play-test stages, but the publisher hemmed and hawed and tried to cut costs, so much so Glen eventually gave up in disgust.  A very few play-test copies are in existence as a result.&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;    Divine Right&#10;&#10;&#10;";0;4.0;3.0

It can be played alone or combined with Dark World and Dark World: Village of Fear to form an adventure campaign.&#10;&#10;";1993;5.95258;1.4286
1780;Knights of Camelot;"Knights of Camelot ranks right alongside Divine Right; it is an early TSR game brimming with flavour.&#10;&#10;The players are freshly knighted and wander the Arthurian realm looking for damsels in distress, brigands, monsters, other knights to joust with, etc. The game uses a random table generation driver that can lead to an enormous variety of encounters. I remember fondly two incidents:&#10;&#10;In the first, a knight met a Dwarf on a horse. Deciding to approach and meet him (instead of avoiding or charging), the dwarf turned out to be a knight in disguise&mdash;but not just any knight! It was Lancelot, the foremost knight of the realm! We had a sudden vision of the hollowed-out horse necessary to hide Lancelot's bulk&hellip;&#10;&#10;In another incident, a player led a charmed life and pulled ahead of the others in their quest for the Holy Grail. He met Merlin repeatedly and ended up with a special charger, magic lance, and magic shield&mdash;the works! England wasn't much of a challenge for him any more, so he decided to cross the Channel to France. Bad move! His ship sank in a storm so he washed up on the shore minus all his equipment and followers. Dejected, he trudged to the nearest castle to ask for help&mdash;but a giant jumped out of the moat and killed him in one blow!&#10;&#10;The game has heavy role-playing elements to it; articles in Dragon Magazine, Issue# 58 explained how one could play knaves (bad knights), and GMs have been known to use the game as an adventure generator for RPGs.&#10;&#10;";1980;6.536;2.4286
1782;Ancients;"Ancients is a board wargame of Tactical level combat in the age before GunPowder.&#10;&#10;The game contains over five-dozen historical Ancient and Medieval battles scenarios, and many more are being added.&#10;&#10;King of Kings (itself later republished by 3W as Imperator) was a companion game.&#10;&#10;The Rules of Ancients are in the &quot;Files&quot; section.&#10;&#10;";1986;6.75868;2.0
1784;Dark Cults;"An early story-telling card game from the co-designer of Divine Right and Knights of Camelot.&#10;&#10;It is a story-telling card game, foreshadowing Once Upon a Time: The Storytelling Card Game.  In it, the two players represent Life and Death, respectively, and each tries to guide a horror story to their corresponding outcome.  As well as horror, the creator suggests that the game could be used for a science-fiction or mystery story, although the game's cards may be poorly suited to this.&#10;&#10;The second edition was packaged with a magazine called The Cultist.  It proposed solo and four-player variants, and additional &quot;object&quot; cards for the game.&#10;&#10;";1983;6.91473;1.5
1786;Og;"A fun game of senseless caveman-to-caveman fighting.  Each player has a tribe and tries to clobber the other tribes.  Wingnut also put out a &quot;role-playing game&quot; along the same lines, where your skills are individual words --great fun.&#10;&#10;Replaced by a Role Playing Game; Og (Revised)&#10;&#10;";1994;5.46154;0.0
1788;Phart!  The Dispersing;"A parody of Magic The Gathering which is all about...Farts.&#10;&#10;College-level humour.&#10;&#10;The mechanics are mostly borrowed from Nuclear War: you play food cards followed by fart cards.  The &quot;damage&quot; to the target's &quot;fresh air points&quot; is the product of the two card values.  Upon having to &quot;leave the room&quot; because you ran out of fresh air, you get an &quot;act of ultimate flatulence&quot;: firing off all remaining food and fart card pairs.&#10;&#10;The only parody of Magic here is the title. The game is a variation of Nuclear War, The food cards are the warheads and the Phart cards are the delivery system.  There is no propoganda-peace phase though.&#10;&#10;";1995;4.45;2.0
1790;Rollout: The Game of the Risk-Takers;"The game of the risk-takers.&#10;&#10;Each player is the C.E.O. (Chief Executive Officer) of a multinational corporation. As a C.E.O. you buy and sell shares, develop new products and compete for a monopoly of the global market &mdash; the battlefield of business. If you have enough cash, you attempt to takeover your opponents' companies, put them out of business, and out of the game.&#10;&#10;Rollout plays with 2 - 6 players.&#10;&#10;";1987;5.63291;2.125
1792;Star Viking;"Box back description:&#10;&#10;&quot;Raiding vessels sweep across the star systems to loot glittering worlds. In system after system, dark cruisers materialize from hyperspace, launching a cloud of fighters to vaporize the local in-system patrol boats -- then comes the savage plunder of whole planets by powersuited raiding parties and grav-armor detachments.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Scattered thinly across the Outrim sector, the frigates of the Federate squadron desperately deploy, attempting to weld the undermanned planetary defenses and low-tech local militias into a cohesive force capable of resisting the star-born horror from beyond the rim -- the coming of the STAR VIKINGS.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;STAR VIKING is a game of interstellar raiding and plunder for two players.

1796;Pampas Railroads;"Players vie for control of six railroads in Argentina.  A deck of cards (3 Offer Stock, 4 Develop Settlements, 5 Construct Track) is used each round to determine player actions.  The deck is passed to the left and an action taken until there is just one action card type left in the deck.  Dividends are then paid (based on railroad value and total number of shares), and a new round is started.  The game lasts for nine rounds, at which time a final payoff is made based on value, income, and actual shares sold.  There are only 5 shares of each railroad available, with the money from the stock purchase going into the railroad treasury.  Also, all track construction must be paid for out of railroad treasuries, and the track is drawn along pre-defined routes using plastic crayons.  Settlements are developed using player funds, which in turn increases the income available to a railroad.  The player with the most money after the final payoff wins.&#10;&#10;The fourth game in the Prairie Railroads Series.&#10;&#10;";2001;7.07041;3.3214
1798;Battle Dice;"Players start with 1000 life points, and attempt to drain their opponents while staying alive themselves.  Players hit their opponents by rolling combinations of dice that match those on the card (five of a kind: 100) (pair: 10).  First to run out loses.  Other cards affect the number and type of dice rolled, payoffs and other effects on the game.  Game can be played with a 120 card stand alone set or several single cards in addition to starter sets.&#10;&#10;";0;4.33333;0.0
1800;Mythos;"In this card game based in H.P Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, you play an investigator (represented by a double sized card that has your stats, special abilities and keeps your story organized) who must complete stories without going insane.  From a deck of at least 52 cards you draw 13 and take turns playing one at a time so it moves at a brisk pace.  You stock your deck with at least 20 points of stories (usually 3 or 4) and try to get the required cards into play.  As an example The card 'A Day in the Life of a M. U. Student' requires you to visit 3 Different Miskatonic University Locations, cast a spell, summon a monster, go to a country site and play an ally of the opposite sex.  When you have fulfilled the conditions you score the card and gain sanity.  In this card's case you score 8 points and gain 2 sanity.&#10;&#10;The types of cards you have are locations (you almost always occupy one), allies, monsters, events, tomes, spells, artifacts and adventures.  A round lasts until there are two passes, at which time all monsters played fight each other then go after the investigators to disable their allies or reduce their sanity.  You can throw allies in front of the monsters as cannon fodder to protect your investigator.  You then decide what cards you are going to keep in your hand (each investigator has a minimum and a maximum number of cards that must be kept) and draw back to 13 for the next round.  Because of this you blow through your deck very quickly and you will go through it a couple of times in most games.&#10;&#10;There are also some very nasty phobias and events to play on your opponents to interfere with their strategies.  There is a lot of interaction and the Lovecraftian atmosphere is keenly felt.&#10;&#10;";1996;6.65293;2.5556
1802;Zwickern;"Zwickern is a public-domain card game of the fishing variety, in which the game starts with a pool of cards on the table and players try to claim these cards for points by using the cards in their hands. Most cards have a single number in the corner to show their value when being played, while some cards have two numbers (e.g., 2/12) and cards like these can be either value when played or when lying on the table; each card also has a victory point value.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player plays one card from her hand and either:&#10;&#10;    Buys cards from the display (using an 8, for example, to buy a 5 and 3, or an 8, or all three cards)&#10;    Builds a pile of cards (by adding or subtracting the card played with a card or pile already on the table, or vice versa)&#10;    Plays to the table (making the card available for piles or buys on future turns)&#10;&#10;&#10;After players play out the few cards in their hand, they receive a few more cards. After a certain number of rounds, the game ends and players sum the points of the cards they've collected, earning additional points for collecting the most cards and for buying all cards on display during a turn. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;";1999;4.91389;1.8
1804;Inklings;"This game received Games Magazine's Game of the Year award in 1993.&#10;&#10;Players form two teams of at least two players (equipment is provided for six total, although more players can be added if you improvise). Each player is given a card with seven words in a category, and a wipe-off board with space for clues for each of them. Players then attempt to write the shortest possible clues for their seven words. In turn, each player puts his or her board in the display rack. After announcing the category, their teammates have a limited amount of time to guess the words. If any are left unanswered, the other team is given a single shot to guess each word&#10;&#10;Won Games Magazine Game of the Year award in 1993.&#10;1993 Mensa Select&#10;&#10;";1993;6.38007;1.5
1806;The Piggyback Brigade;"The merry trunk gang consists of seven multicolored piglets, who love nothing more than running through the meadows - on roads, which are so narrow that they cannot pass the other pigs - except, if they stand on top of one another! Naturally, they know how to do this, as they are not normal piglets, but genuine circus piglets! And even if they do not run a race, they gladly demonstrate acrobatic exercises or set up themselves in marvelous pyramids.&#10;&#10;After the board has been constructed, players' take turns rolling a special die numbering 1-4 and moves his pig based on the number he rolled. If a black number is rolled the player may get to take another turn. If you land on the same space as another pig you now move with the bottom piglets piggyback style.

1808;Witch Hunt;"Witch Hunt is a light-hearted look at the Salem Witch Trials which occurred in Salem and Danvers, Massachusetts in 1693.  Players take the part of paranoid villagers bent on accusing their townsmates of heinous acts of witchcraft while protecting themselves from similar accusations.  Accusations damage a villager's Reputation, and whenever a witch trial is called, the villager with the lowest Reputation hangs.  The player who called for the witch trial gets points for hanging his opponents' villagers, but beware--sometimes a trial will cause your own villager to be hanged, in which case you lose points.  Witch Hunt features frivolous accusations, valiant defenses, last-minute escapes from the gallows, and of course--the Village Cat.&#10;&#10;";2000;5.36667;1.4
1812;Night of the Ill-Tempered Squirrel;"Night of the Ill-Tempered Squirrel is a non-collectible card game for 3-6 players.  Each player takes the part of a bad director attempting to make the worst B monster movie possible.  Movies are filmed by playing cards representing the seven main elements of a motion picture: Movie Title, Actor, Plot, Monster, Special Effects, Set Location, and Finale.  Each movie element card is rated in the industry standard &quot;star&quot; system where 1 star is very, very bad and 5 stars is Oscar quality.  Cards can be played either on yourself or your opponents, but there is one major hitch: every movie element is played face down and you can't look at any of them after they are in play, including the cards that you yourself played! Additional special cards add hilarity to hijinks.  Making a bad movie has never been so hard!&#10;&#10;";2000;5.16667;1.0

1816;Mississippi;"An abstract race game set on the Mississippi river. Each person has a boat (actually a hexagonal piece with the numbers 1-6 written on each of the 6 sides of the piece). The board is a long track of hexes that wind back and forth in an 'S' pattern. Each person places his 'boat' on the start space with one of the numbers facing forwards. Each person also starts with a number of 'Logs'. These are used to move your boat forward 1 space for each log spent. (You can also decide to move backwards - gaining 1 log for each space moved back).&#10;&#10;Now comes the complication - bumping. If your boat stops in a space that is adjacent to 1 or more others, bumping occurs. To determine where your boat ends up you look at the hex sides facing each other (on your boat and on the adjacent one(s)). You subtract the adjacent boat's hex side number from yours - and if it is positive your boat moves forward that number of spaces, and if negative - the other boat moves forward that number of spaces. Now you check to see if your boat is adjacent to another boat and if so repeat the bumping procedure.&#10;&#10;If your boat is next to more than 1 boat, and has at least 1 positive difference, your boat moves forward. If you have more than 1 positive, add them together and move forward that distance. If you have a negative difference the other boats move in clockwise order.&#10;&#10;For subsequent turns - you can freely change the facing (&amp; thus the hex side number facing forward) by 60 degrees. Moving it further than 1 hexside costs you 1 &quot;log&quot; per extra 60 degree facing change. You then decide whether to move forward or back and resolve any bumping.&#10;&#10;The first boat to the finish wins.&#10;&#10;";1987;5.9423;2.1053
1818;Icehouse: Black Ice;"Black Ice is a two-color set of Icehouse pieces.  Included were a hemp drawstring bag and a chessboard bandana with Martian Chess dividing lines. It did not include any game rules but did feature a little coupon which was supposed to be redeemable for a free copy of a booklet of rules that would eventually be created for the set.&#10;&#10;Because Icehouse: The Martian Chess Set usually gets used for games other than Icehouse, and because many of those games have become increasingly deep, and have begun to require additional colors, Looney Labs released this Black Opaque and Crystal Clear set of 30 more stackable plastic pyramids.  These pieces are equally suitable for playing Icehouse as they are for Zendo, Zarcana, Focus, or any of the other dozens of I:tMCS games designed by the Icehouse fan community.&#10;&#10;";2000;7.02222;3.0
1820;Z-G;"Z-G is a combination miniatures wargame/collectible card game. The miniatures, which represent arena combat robots, are actually 5&quot; action figures with 14 points of articulation and 8 pieces of removable armor. Each piece of armor has a corresponding collectible card giving its statistics and special powers. Each basic set includes a fixed 10 card set (1 card per piece of equipment, including the figure itself, plus a character card)&#10;&#10;The game is played in rounds, which start with all players choosing which 3 pieces of equipment to use this round. Each piece of equipment also has an impulse rating, and whoever has the highest impulse goes first. Players then use their cards to move their figure a number of card lengths and/or use attacks based on a color-matching system on the ends of each card. If your attack is successful, a piece of your opponent's armor is destroyed (and so is its corresponding card).&#10;&#10;One of the more innovative parts in all this is that the actual figure poses have bearing on gameplay. Movement points must be used to enter a stance, and each stance has certain advantages and disadvantages (Except lying down, which is universally bad)&#10;&#10;Z-G was first shown publicly for sale and demonstration at Origins 2001 in Columbus, Ohio, with the subtitle &quot;Citizen.&quot; Although planned as the first set in a series of sets, &quot;Citizen Z-G&quot; was ultimately the only published set.&#10;&#10;";2001;6.75;2.3333
1822;Wilderness War;"Wilderness War is a card-driven wargame, dramatically simpler and more streamlined than either For the People or Paths of Glory, but the complexity still exceeds the classic Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, but only just.&#10;&#10;In Wilderness War, the players get to re-fight the 7 Years War in North America. Although only a single deck of strategy cards is used, &agrave; la We the People, the two sides are dramatically different in character: the French are irregular-heavy (especially Indians) and rely on raiding to tie down the superior numbers of British Regular &amp; Provincial drilled troops, who will themselves be intent on sieges and trying to force a pitched battle. Like Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, the fortunes of war turn as the game goes on: the French are masters early, with the crushing British manpower advantage accruing late.&#10;&#10;Wilderness War takes two players into the French &amp; Indian War, 1755-1760, the climactic struggle between France and Britain for control of North America. It uses strategy cards and a point-to-point map similar to GMT's award winning For the People and Paths of Glory. Players maneuver and fight over a map stretching from Northern Virginia to Canada. As the leader of French or British forces in North America, you will need to defend your frontier, raid your enemy's frontier, build fortification networks through the harsh wilderness, recruit Indian allies, besiege forts and fortresses, and deal with events occurring in Europe that are above and beyond your control.&#10;&#10;Wilderness War includes a deck of strategy cards for conducting campaigns and incorporating the many events and personalities of the war. The French player can recruit up to sixteen different Indian tribes as allies, secure a continental alliance in Europe against Great Britain, sortie his squadron at Louisbourg, force a ministerial crisis in London, and work toward draining support for the war from the provincial assemblies. The British player can recruit Mohawks and Cherokees, plan for and conduct amphibious operations, implement a global strategy via William Pitt, destroy the French fleet at Quiberon Bay, and expel the Acadians. Relive the history of this exciting time when the fate of Canada hung in the balance.&#10;&#10;Wilderness War is by the designer of the more recent Labyrinth: The War on Terror, 2001 &#226;&#128;&#147; ? and Andean Abyss and other Series: COIN (GMT) games.&#10;&#10;";2001;7.69922;3.307
1824;Trump: The Game;"In Trump: the Game players compete in two parts.  In the first part, players circle the board, feeding money into the eight available properties, then bidding on those properties (not being able to see how much the property is worth) and collecting &quot;Trump&quot; cards.  When all the properties are gone, the negotiation phase begins.  Players use their Trump cards to buy and sell properties, some cards award huge payoffs for specific sets.  After each player has passed their turn, the property values are revealed, and the player with the most money wins (usually in the $400-$600M range).&#10;&#10;";1989;4.33746;1.6591

1828;Doomsday Cult 2000;"In Doomsday Cult 2000, players take the role of cult leaders bent on bringing about the end of the world.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player secretly chooses a Doomsday date in the month of December, 1999 (play commences on December 1st, and each turn is one day long). From there, play mechanics are reminiscent of Steve Jackson's Illuminati: cards representing potential cult members (a/k/a Sheep) are dealt into a common pool in the middle of the table. Players in their turn use Influence to recruit Sheep for their Flock (cult); each new Sheep you control adds to your Influence, and many of them grant special abilities as well. In addition to recruiting uncontrolled Sheep, you can also try to convert (steal) or &quot;deprogram&quot; (make uncontrolled) Sheep belonging to other players' Flocks, or declare jihad and have one of your Sheep making a suicide attack on one of your rivals' Sheep.&#10;&#10;When your chosen Doomsday comes around, all of the Sheep you currently control commit ritual mass suicide in an attempt to trigger the apocalypse. A die roll determines whether they succeed; the more Sheep you sacrifice, the better the odds. If you do successfully end the world, you win; if you fail, you pick a new Doomsday and start gathering a Flock again; if the world hasn't ended by January 1st, 2000, everybody loses.&#10;&#10;The game is DTP quality, with the cards laser-printed on (pre-cut) heavy marbled paper.&#10;&#10;";1998;0.0;0.0

It's as airtight as the Titanic and as solid as a wet paper bag. This place just begs to be robbed.&#10;&#10;Enter you, and your infantile collection of friends. It's not enough to simply loot this mall. No, you have to do it with a certain amount of flair. Which boils down to an all-night looting race, with shopping carts, flashlights, and guns.&#10;&#10;The object? Park your car, dash into the mall, and load your shopping cart with the goodies on your list. You can snitch stuff out of the stores if you like, but it's even more fun (and easier) to steal it from your friends. And that would explain why you're carrying a huge gun.&quot;&#10;&#10;The 2nd edition is called Spree!

1837;Word Yahtzee;"Word Yahtzee is another addition to the Yahtzee family, which is one of the most recognised dice games in history. However instead of numbers, letters and words take center stage.&#10;&#10;Players still have a maximum of 3 rolls in a given turn but now players have 7 dice at their disposal. The dice in Word Yahtzee contain a set of letters similar to that on offer in Scrabble and each letter is also tagged with a value, which is used in creating a score when a player meets one of the criteria.&#10;&#10;The targets to aim for include words of certain lengths (top half of the score pad), whilst the bottom half includes categories such as 2 words, 3 words, all vowels and all consonants to name a few.&#10;&#10;To achieve a Yahtzee a player must be able to form a 7-Letter word.&#10;&#10;At the end of each game the highest score is declared the winner but like classic Yahtzee, players an play all 6 games featured on a single page and combine those scores to play a more epic game.&#10;&#10;Word Yahtzee is a word dice game.&#10;&#10;";1978;5.07454;1.6

Starting in the center are two hurricanes (large pieces). On your turn, you roll for direction and distance and move one or the other hurricane as indicated (you have considerable leeway in the precise path being followed).

1844;Battle of Britain;"Hitler's war machine has rolled like a juggernaut across the Continent, crushing all opposition. Only Britain still stands, isolated and defiant, readying itself for a mortal struggle between the Luftwaffe and the Royal Air Force. For the first time in history, air power will decide the fate of a nation.&#10;&#10;August 1940: The Royal Air Force has been awaiting massive German air raids since Churchill refused to make peace with Germany. And they did not have to wait long - in fact, far too short to build up the RAF to a strength that would be able to match the German Luftwaffe. But besides its fighters, the RAF has other weapons to help deal with the &quot;Huns&quot;: a chain of RDF (radar) towers along the British coast, and an elaborate system of communications, signal evaluation and fighter control and guidance. If those are used skilfully, the resulting economy of Fighter Command operations might just be able to offset the sheer power of the German Luftflotten (&quot;air fleets&quot;).&#10;&#10;You are in command of all four RAF Fighter Groups to match them against the incoming raids.

With 2 or 3 players, only use 2 or three colors.&#10;&#10;Object: To only have your own color under your cups.&#10;&#10;Game Course:&#10;The starting player chooses a player, and points to one of his cups. He then says something like, &quot;The smallest cup in that stack is my color&quot;. (He may also choose  the middle sized cup in the stack.&#10;&#10;The player spoken to uncovers the named cup.&#10;&#10;If the guess is correct, the player receives the cup of his color, and gives the other player a cup of the same size from beneath one of his cups. Both sets of cups are uncovered visibly so that all players may see what is beneath them.&#10;&#10;The players may then shuffle their cups to try to obscure which cup was just revealed.&#10;&#10;A player who made a correct guess goes again. He may choose a stack from the same player, or of a different player. A player can keep going as long as he is right. Once the player misses his guess, then the player whose cup he was guessing takes the next turn.&#10;&#10;Mixing cups:&#10;Whenever a player has to reveal his cups, he is allowed to mix them. Players who have not shown their cups are NOT allowed to mix theirs.&#10;&#10;Each player may peek under his own stacks secretly at any time.&#10;End of Game:&#10;The game ends when any one player has only his own color cups under his stacks.&#10; &#10;&#10;&#10;";1999;3.83333;0.0

1849;WÃ¶rtersee;"Using the game components, a &quot;sea&quot; of letters is prepared and revealed as a timer is started. Simultaneously, all players start searching for words in the jumble. When you think that you have found a word, you place one of your boats between the first and second letters of the word with the bow of your boat pointing towards the second letter. This reserves the two letters for your own use. You don't have to say what the word is when you place the boat. (Two boats may be between the same two letters if they point in different directions)&#10;&#10;Once placed, boats may not be moved! When the sand runs out the round is over. Each player in turn spells out their words. Each letter in each word earns you one point. The game lasts four rounds. Most points wins.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.53448;1.5

1851;Mythrole: Merchants;"Mythrole: Merchants is a board game of strategic trading set in a fantasy realm.  Players take the part of powerful merchants attempting to gain economic prominence throughout the Known Lands.  Gold is earned by using caravans to transport resources (wood, grain, fish, stone, ore, and precious metals) from source locations to demand locations which change dynamically during the game.  Trading is not always peaceful, though, and merchants must hire mercenaries and build warehouses to protect their shipments.  Diplomacy plays a key role as players are free to make all manner deals and treaties with other Merchants, including such things as setting up toll roads or extorting weak trade groups by threatening them.  Mythrole: Merchants is suitable for 2-6 players working alone or in teams, and plays in 2-6 hours, with the length being customizable by choosing the appropriate victory conditions.&#10;&#10;";2001;2.0;0.0
1852;Insikt;"A trivia game (Insikt = Insight) where you in the basic version should first get 21 points through answering questions correctly. Then starts the end-game towards the finish. The winner is the first one who first gains a better insight, i.e. come to the middle of the game board. Tactic, a good poker face and the ability to, during pressure against the hour-glass make well thought-out long shots, are things which determine how well a player may succeed. (Quotation from the rules leaflet.)&#10;&#10;There's an advanced version, where you secretly may bet upon if somebody may manage to answer the questions of not.&#10;&#10;A lot of companies have used this game as a gift, so there exist a large number of boxes with different logos on them (and they are dirt common in thrift stores).&#10;&#10;";1991;4.10714;1.0

1858;Diamond City;"A bank robbery has occurred in Diamond City. All the players are eye witnesses and their task is to find and identify the robber. You are running around the board checking concealed cards to get clues to the robber. Instead of clues you might find other valuable cards, like money, weapons, duel cards or the large diamond.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to find out who the robber is and transport him to the police station, without any of the opponent kidnapping him to get the honor from you. If it shows up that yourself are the robber (1 chance out of 27), then you must steal back the diamond and escape to the airport.&#10;&#10;Note: Nelospelit already published this sometime in the latter half of the 1980's as Silminn&auml;kij&auml; (Eyewitness), when it was a Wild West themed game set in 'Tuscon' (sic). The 'diamond' was 'loot' from a robbery, the cars horses, and so on, the production values a little bit weaker, but otherwise it is exactly the same game.&#10;&#10;";1995;3.56897;1.0

The points are received by killing warriors, completing missions or via special card play.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     http://www.lackeyccg.com/downloads.html&#10;&#10;&#10;";1994;5.73209;2.1111
1860;Dragon Dice;"Players use colorful dice to represent armies of different fantasy races which battle to control essential terrain in this fast-rolling game.  Any number of players can join the struggle, although it's designed as a multiplayer game. The first player to capture two terrains immediately wins the game, or you may try to obliterate your opponent's dice. Spells and layered strategies benefit certain races as you try to control the odds in this dynamic game full of surprises!&#10;&#10;History: 2-Player Starter Sets, including completely rewritten rules, were released in 2006. These rules are available online at [www.sfr-inc.com]. The new Starters have perfectly paired racial armies, not random assortments like the old retail packaging, plus four terrain dice, two dragons, the complete rulebook, and new army placement cards. The races are paired up as Coral Elf/Lava Elf, Dwarf/Goblin, Feral/Undead, and Amazon/Swamp Stalker. Hybrid Dragons were offered in 2008. Acolytes of the Eldarim (a large expansion of the Eldarim race) was released in August 2009, along with a re-release of the Dragonkin. The Battlefields expansion (new major and minor terrains) was released in August 2010, adding exciting new options and strategies. The Dragoncrusader and Dragonzealots (new Eldarim Champions) were released in 2011. Dwarves and Goblins were re-released as kickers in 2012 and now include a 5th monster for each race. Magic Items were also re-released in the Battle Chest expansion in 2012. Coral Elves and Lava Elves were re-released as kickers in 2013 and now include a 5th monster. Amazons were re-released as kickers in 2014 and now include a 5th monster.&#10;&#10;The Starters listed above are now out of print. New Starters have been released that have 30 health of Firewalkers and 30 health of Treefolk. Those starters also contain 4 Terrains, 4 dragons, 2 playmats, and a simplified set of starter rules.&#10;&#10;";1995;5.92057;2.3846
1861;Dragonfire;"Dragonfire was an attempt by Target/Heartbreaker to entice young adults into roleplaying, by means of devising a crossover between a roleplaying game and a fantasy miniatures boardgame similar to Milton Bradley and Games Workshop with their Hero Quest game system. This boxed game consists of 16 miniatures, various room and corridor tiles, cardboard doors with stand-ups, and some dungeon dressings represented by die cut cardboard pieces. The aim is to complete the task of each scenario given in the scenario booklet. One player is the Dungeon Master and sets up the rooms and monsters within when the other players reach them; the instructions are very specific about how to place the monsters, traps or items they encounter. Players are cooperative and do not compete against each other. Of course the players won't see the adventure booklet in advance or during the game, only the game master. All the players are knights of different colors (red, blue, green, and yellow). The same four colors are used for the plastic miniatures of: 4 orcs with bows, 4 trolls with clubs, and 4 Dragon Lords with swords.&#10;&#10;Between each scenario may the players increase their rank, depending on how many points they have collected during the scenario. They get points depending on which monsters they have killed plus one extra for a successfully done scenario. In the Dungeons are there monsters, traps, magic items and other stuff. Overall, the designers do a decent job of making the scenarios entertaining given a limited amount material in the game. Each turn, a new event card is overturned and strange things take place. This is fun at first but becomes predictable in later games.&#10;&#10;The dicing and combat system uses colored dice with different probabilities of scoring a hit - similar to Heroquest's Skulls and shields except that they are just circles on the dice and represent more of a yes/no answer when rolling. The game is slightly more advanced than Heroquest in that players can advance in levels similar to dungeons and dragons. As you increase in levels, you switch color of dice when attacking and defending, thus increasing your chances to score a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;hit&quot; result on the dice. Otherwise the game is very similar to HeroQuest in general.&#10;&#10;Heartbreaker Hobbies produced a couple of lead elf miniatures designed for use with Dragonfire. At the same time, they put out a rare poster/magazine called &quot;Symmetry&quot; #1 that included two new magic items for the game, stats for two elf characters, and a short scenario using all of this with the Dragonfire game. One would assume that consumer response was lacking given that no attention was given to the Dragonfire game in later issues of Symmetry and the game went into obscurity. Still, the game could be used for a couple of night's gaming, especially if introducing children to D&amp;D style gaming or if one wanted to pirate the minis and room pieces to use with other game systems.&#10;&#10;";1992;5.87229;1.875
1862;Avalon;"There are separate cards to determine the course of the tournament, according to the number of players. A round (1 2 etc) always starts with a bartering session, whereby cards may be exchanged and sold. After that, the knights must do battle! In order to be allowed to fight, the knights must he in possession of a full set of weaponry.&#10;A full set consist of shield, sword, lance and armor. Anyone of them might be substituted by a joker card.&#10;&#10;The game is finished when only one player is left with a complete set of weaponry. The winner is the player with the largest fortune at this time.&#10;&#10;";1994;5.4;1.3333
1863;Tatort Titanic;"A &quot;Clue&quot;-like game. Within 25 turns find as many clues as possible, to make a deduction of the suspect, his motive, murder weapon, place of murder and time of murder. To begin the game, one each of these cards are secretly placed in a closed envelope.&#10;&#10;Every player plays one of the 6 detectives who happen to be aboard Titanic. Each player also  has one of six different random special qualities. After the murder there are 25 hours left before the ship sinks, so you are in a hurry to solve the mystery. If none has found all the clues after 25 turns, the player with most correct clues is the winner.&#10;&#10;You collect clues either through visiting the different rooms and collecting &quot;clue cards&quot; or questioning (=draw a card, which he has found) one of the other detectives, which you happen to stumble upon.&#10;&#10;";1987;4.11818;1.5
1864;Expedition Robinson;"Based upon the Swedish original TV competition &quot;Survivor&quot;, where the participants stay on a desert island for several weeks, competing in games and trying to get enough food to survive.&#10;Through bluffing  you should make your opponents  believe that your Robinson characters are someone else than those that you have!&#10;The games in the game are both trivia and dexterity types.&#10;&#10;Each turn is a day on the island, which consists of 4 actions: Choice of Robinson character to move (it doesn't need to be your own, as you may bluff the other here), Investigation of the island, A Robinson competition and The island council (where you elect which character has to leave the game this turn). The characters may also disappear out of the game through &quot;illness&quot; - a special symbol tile, which you might find during the exploration.&#10;&#10;";1999;3.65182;1.6667
1865;Astrotime;"A game of psychology, where you have to know yourself. There's an astrological moment in the game, which you might completely ignore.&#10;You start the game by preparing your personal game tablet by taking the card with your zodiac. You place 10 red dots according to this card and add 4 other red dots on characterics which you think suits yourself.&#10;Then there is 12 turns (one for each sign in the Zodiac), where 3 cards (2 cards if 3-4 players) are drawn and put in the middle of the board. You choose which of the cards suits your personality best. After all choosing is done, all put their chosen card into their personal game tablet and if you have at least five dots and has the most on the chosen card, you'll get points. These points should be spread in as many areas as possible, to get the most points.&#10;&#10;";1990;4.63441;1.3333
1866;Brainstorm;"To rattle off so many things, persons etc in the desired category (due to the card drawn). For each answer which is written on the category card you may advance one step (two if that's an unusual answer, written in italics).&#10;&#10;Brainstorm is highly derivative of Outburst!, but with new game mechanics.&#10;&#10;";1990;5.73014;1.6429
1867;Curse of the Idol;"The game target is to fetch the sword in the stone, then go to the temple and there chose the right hole in the idol. If you manage to get the blood stone, then you should hurry back to the camp with it. The others may try, to steal it from you, of course.&#10;&#10;You can either move your own pawn or the black adventurer to block other players. To enter into the centre of the board with the &quot;blood stone statue&quot;, you need to walk over movable cog-wheels, which turn every time you land on certain squares.&#10;&#10;This game plays like an advanced &quot;Ludo&quot;. It is difficult to put together the 3D game board if you don't mark up the corner support the first time you succeed to assemble it.&#10;&#10;";1990;5.37077;1.1915
1868;Conquistador;"A simple card game of empire-building rivalry.&#10;&#10;There are some 15 territory cards rated 1 through 3, some of which are dealt out to the players at the start (each gets a 1 and a 2 territory).  There are Revolt and Cannon cards.  The remaining cards are Development cards, each rated from 1 to 6.  On your turn, you draw a card and play or discard one.  The deck of a little over a hundred cards is played through and then everyone scores.  Once the deck is exhausted, play continues until everyone's hand is also exhausted.  Once your hand drops below four cards, there are some limitations on card play that come into effect.&#10;&#10;When developing a Territory you own, you ideally would play a 1, then a 2, and so on up to a 6.  The developments must be played in increasing numerical sequence, but they need not be consecutive.  At the end of the game, a territory scores the number of development cards on it times its basic multiplier (1&times;, 2&times; or 3&times;) - so an undeveloped territory is worthless.  If you managed to have a sequence of at least four consecutive developments on the territory, you score a sizable bonus.&#10;&#10;Revolt cards prevent a territory from being developed or attacked; they also cancel an existing revolt card (there are only 8 of those in the deck).  It is sometimes good strategy to play a revolt on a territory of your own to prevent it from being attacked.&#10;&#10;Cannon cards are used to attack other players' territories; you play a cannon face down, and so does the defender.  Both reveal their cards and add a die roll.  The attacker's total must beat the defender's for the attack to succeed.  When it does, you roll a die and this indicates how many cards you plunder from that territory.  If that roll is high enough, you can even steal the territory itself.  Plundered cards must be allocated to your territories right away or discarded.&#10;&#10;Cannon can also be used, if rated four or better, to empty one of your territories from its development cards so as to redeploy them - in effect, you are raiding yourself.&#10;&#10;A number of small variant rules are supplied in the rule book.  The cards are printed in French, English and Dutch.&#10;&#10;It is good strategy to build your hand for the end game, so you can, for example, protect a territory with a Revolt, then unprotect it, redeploy Development cards with a strong Cannon, and complete the territory's development with your last few card plays.&#10;&#10;Awards&#10;&#10;Card Game As d&#039;Or 2001&#10;&#10;";2001;5.0;2.25

Each player may only participate with two horses in each race. You may shorten the game by pre-selecting a fewer number of races (5 are recommended).&#10;&#10;Was first published under the name J&auml;gersrospelet by Alga in Sweden, in 1941; this may be a completely different game though, as the component mix and game board seem to be very different from later versions of J&auml;gersro.&#10;&#10;J&auml;gersro is a famous racing stadium for horses in the city of Malm&ouml;.&#10;&#10;";1945;6.10464;1.9444
1870;Gold Train;"Frontier discovery, labor shortages and gold mines are the focus of Gold Train.  This game forces difficult decisions and often unpleasant player interaction.  Set in the Old West of the USA.&#10;&#10;The game board is constructed by the players at the start of the game.  During the setup, initial terrain tiles are placed (mostly face down) starting at the center of the board and moving out in rings (similar to Twilight Imperium: Third Edition).  Only a portion of the tiles are uncovered at the start and the board is different every game.&#10;&#10;Players bid for starting areas and play begins.  &#10;Players search (or discover) terrain (similar to the search process used in 2038: Tycoons of the Asteroid Belt).  This phase also allows players to apply various counters that affect terrain (help themselves or hurt other players) and to discover mines.&#10;Then players use labor that they have procured to build tracks.&#10;Finally, players get paid.  If a player has track to a mine, the railroad services the mine and collects income.  Coal mines pay the least and Gold mines pay the most.&#10;&#10;But watch out for the Dalton Boys or the Clinton gang.&#10;&#10;";2000;5.08824;2.0
1871;Dark Side;"Each human being has his dark side, often well hidden behind a friendly smile. Dark Side is about the friendly unveiling of such secrets. The players try to reveal the dark sides of the other players and to hide their own secrets well. There are points for revealing secrets, for which the players move forward on the success track. In the end, whoever stands farthest up on the success track wins, but only if his dark side was not revealed.&#10;&#10;The cards in the players' hands represent the secrets. The players can brag about them in order to get points, but they must be careful that their own secrets are not revealed by the other players, because then the other players will earn points.&#10;&#10;";2001;4.61358;1.8889
1872;Hurricane: The Game of the Tropics;"2-4 players brave the storm as they buy and sell exotic resorts in hurricane prone areas.  They must buy insurance and take advantage of opportunities to prepare their resorts, or face the imminent threat of the hurricane!  There are many different hurricane tracks based on real historical data, which are written on hurricane program cards that are moved through a sleeve.  The players never know where the hurricane will move next.  There is also an advanced play option, where players cruise their yachts through the inner game board from one resort to the next, while trying to avoid the inevitable hurricanes.  But players must also beware of another threat... The Bermuda Triangle!  The player with the most money at the end of the game is the winner, and therefore the best prepared player.&#10;&#10;The game was designed and produced by Stan Strickland, a retired science teacher and meteorologist who now owns Outer Limit Games.

1873;Babylon 5 Component Game System: Core Sets;"Component Game Systems came out with a number of component game systems that used the same sort-of-collectible approach (a roughly similar game is Space Race). Besides Babylon 5, there was Hercules, Xena, and Star Trek. The Babylon 5 game was apparently derived from the unpublished Galactic Empires board game, based on the CCG of the same name --Companion Games (Galactic Empires' publisher) became Component Game Systems in the process.&#10;&#10;The basic idea is that each player need only buy his part of the game, representing in this case a specific political entity from the Babylon 5 universe. Players sit down at the same table and put their components in common to have a game. Pretty cool.&#10;&#10;In the Babylon 5 game, you take control of a certain faction which is trying to gain power in the galaxy. You play the role of an ambassador on board Babylon 5. You explore the vast stretches of space, lead huge fleets into battle, and control the economy of your faction. There are several ways to achieve victory ranging from economic growth to all out militaristic control of the universe. Diplomacy is not to be neglected either, as the more powerful game changes are brought up in Babylon 5 council vote to be decided.&#10;&#10;You construct your playing 'board' using hexagonal shaped pieces that come with the game. The various pieces are &#10;different and can represent a multitude of things so that the game is different every time you play. In addition to the board and the ships that move on it, there are cards. Players may buy cards allowing special actions above and beyond the normal game, like an extra move or more EPs. You can create decks for each player as per CCGs, or you can just draw from a common deck after handing out the empire specific cards.&#10;&#10;Using your faction's wealth and resources you play the game and explore the map. You search for planets to colonize and possibly conquer. Use your fleets to engage in battles and use characters to assist you in reaching your faction's goals. The choices are yours and will decide if your faction is successful.&#10;&#10;The game does a very good job of recreating the B5 universe, with play action matching pretty closely the series' happenings. In terms of mechanics, it is similar to Twilight Imperium and Les Cochons de l'espace.&#10;&#10;There are two core sets, although CGS initially intended five (one for each of the show's seasons). They are the 2258 and 2259 Core Sets. The first was published in two formats, the 1997 first printing (Limited Edition; CB5-101) using a smaller, unimpressive box (they were in a hurry to get it to the store shelves by Christmas of that year), whilst the 1998 second printing (CB5-001) came in a beautiful large box (allowing room for the storage of extra sets) labeled as &quot;Babylon 5: The Board Game&quot;. The 2259 Core Set (CB5-102) was only published in the big box format. The core sets include the Earth Alliance, Narn Regime, Centauri Republic and Minbari factions, which were each available separately (although the core sets include some extra cards and stuff beyond the combination of the four individual Starter Kits). There is supposedly enough difference between the 2258 and 2259 core sets to warrant buying both, although I haven't received my 2259 set yet so I can't be sure.&#10;&#10;Component Game Systems has now disappeared from the face of the earth, and even their domain name (www.c-g-s.com) has been recycled by some unrelated outfit.&#10;&#10;Part of the Component Game System.&#10;&#10;";1997;5.86514;2.8621

1877;Pig Pile;"Pig Pile is an extremely light card (and punny) game. The cards have illustrations of pigs (naturally), and you can be &quot;hog tied&quot; or have a &quot;hog wash&quot;.&#10;&#10;Players start with three face-down cards (called &quot;Slop&quot;) and a hand of six cards. At the start you place three of your cards face-up on top of the slop cards, leaving you with a hand of three cards. Each turn you must play to the central &quot;Pig Pile&quot; one or more cards of the same value that are equal to or greater than the top card of the Pig Pile. If you fail to do so, you must take the entire Pig Pile into your hand. Certain cards have special effects:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Hog Wild: Wild card that can be played at any time and allows any card to played on it next turn.&#10;    Hog Tied (4s): The next player loses his turn.&#10;    Hog Wash (8s): Remove the Pig Pile from the game and take another turn. (If three cards of the same value are played in succession, a Hog Wash takes place automatically.)&#10;    Ewe Turn (11s): Reverse order of play.&#10;&#10;&#10;Each turn you draw back to three cards until the deck runs out. If you have no cards in hand (which can happen only after the deck runs out), you must play a face-up card (a card that you laid aside at start) or if those are gone, a slop card. (Slop cards are played blind, so you could be really screwed.) If you're the first or second player to rid yourself of cards (including your slop), you receive a number of pigs. Whoever has the most pigs after five hands wins.&#10;&#10;";2001;5.63226;1.1628
1878;Moonshot the Game;"MOONSHOT The Game brings to life the fascinating story of mankind&rsquo;s greatest adventure&mdash;the Apollo voyages to the moon. MOONSHOT is not a trivia game, it&rsquo;s a fast-paced game of strategy based on card-play. NASA projects Mercury, Gemini and Apollo provide the backdrop as players are put in command of the Space Race. Each landmark event, pioneering mission, heart-pounding crisis and incredible machine is represented by a playing card. Players use these cards and a supply of fuel cards to complete the historic NASA space missions in a race to be the first to land on the Moon.&#10;&#10;To complete each mission, you must use your fuel supply to assemble the correct equipment, launch the mission and move your playing piece to the corresponding mission patch on the game board. This completes the mission, you receive a replica mission patch and gain a fuel bonus. During the game you can take advantage of special cards called alarms, events and instants. These represent historic events in space history and can be played to speed you progress or hinder your opponents. After completing the required number of missions, be the first to land on the Moon and win the game. MOONSHOT has a wealth of detail and flavor for the space enthusiast. If you're big on space travel or really enjoy space history, this game is a must.

1879;Arena: Morituri te salutant;"Tactical combat game, where you choose one or two characters, who fight each other (it's also possible with a multi-player variant, where some players can cooperate to win). The winner is the one who succeeds in getting  the opponents &quot;Condition Points&quot; down to zero.&#10;&#10;The combat rules are unusual, well thought-out and interesting. Instead of throwing a die, you choose a number 1-6 (depending of the attack type, the range might be lower) on the die and the defense is a certain number of guesses to find out what the opponent attacks with. Number of attacks depends on the active combat card (defense cards gives more guesses, but lower attack damage). The higher value, the higher becomes the damage, but if you always chooses the highest value, it's soon penetrated!&#10;&#10;You play the game by choosing the cards and their order from your characters card deck and you have to out-guess your opponent.&#10;&#10;";1997;7.52819;3.7

Meanwhile becomes the characters better on fighting and defending themselves against monsters, guardians and opponents.&#10;You play two different fractions and with more than two you play co-operative. According to the rules one player should be an &quot;administrator&quot; if you are 3 or 5 players! Probably it's best to play with 2 players.&#10;The combat system is pretty complicated, with a lot of dice rolls.&#10;There's an expansion (expert game) with some more monster quest cards, money tokens, but most important character dial-boards with all statistics about the characters, so you don't need to use paper and pen for this.&#10;&#10;";1995;3.0;0.0

Then you should NOT draw your own piece of paper from &quot;the Source of the Fear&quot;.&#10;The game uses a VHS video tape as a 'video clock' giving the players one hour to complete the game, which is interrupted now and then by the Gatekeeper on the video, who says what the current user may or must do. This makes the game quick and stressful, as you want to conclude you turn as fast as possible, so you won't be the player affected by the Gatekeeper.&#10;It's a modular game board that allows for several different setups.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.06738;1.9512
1882;Blazing Camels;"Blazing Camels is a racing game, in which 3-7 players race their camels to the finish line by playing cards.  Each player has a set of cards labeled one to nine.  During each round, each player chooses a card and after putting it face down, they reveal their choices simultaneously.  The highest untied played card stays on the table while the others are placed into their players' discard pile.

1883;Cataphract;"Cataphract is defined as a heavily armored cavalryman modelled either on the Sarmatians (cataphractarius) or the Persians (clibanarius). He was the ultimate mounted armored warrior of the ancient world, trained in both shock and missile combat.&#10;&#10;Cataphract portrays the development of the art of war wrought by the early Byzantine Empire, during the reign of Emperor Justinian, under his great Generals, Belisarius and Narses. During this period the Byzantine Empire, also known as the Eastern Roman Empire, for a brief period of time, re-captured a large portion of what was formerly the Western Roman Empire. Although successful in its attempts to reconquer Italy and North Africa, the Byzantine Empire's resources were insufficient to hold on to its gains.&#10;&#10;Cataphract covers all the major battles that defined this Early Medieval era. To place these battles in their proper historical context, the Campaign Game, Justinian, is enclosed, which covers the quest to reconquer the Roman Empire under one ruler.&#10;&#10;Thus, Cataphract contains the decisive battles of the era; a Campaign Game; plus a special bonus Viking raid scenario; and the land/naval leaders for an upcoming series of C3i Magazine Modules covering the Peloponnesian War. The second edition of Cataphract add to the six Early Medieval battles of the first edition, the Ancient Battles of the Utus River (447 CE) and the Catalaunian Fields (451 CE) from the original Attila: Scourge of God Module.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;";1999;7.58587;3.381

1885;How Much for the Camel?;"Components:&#10;Twenty-eight cards &#10;An A4 sheet of rules &#10;a piece of cardboard &#10;You have to provide your own money and 'Spit' tokens. &#10;packaged in an envelope&#10;&#10;&quot;The end of the world is nigh.  The only commodity left is ... camels!&#10;The Future. Camels. Space Bucks. You.&quot;&#10;&#10;A dangerous combination. Can you assemble the most impressive herd of camels?&#10;It's the future, and camels are more valuable than gold or any other commodity for that matter. You've got money to burn and camels to buy in this quick bidding game. While quantity is important, it's camel quality that really counts. Will you put your money into the single-hump Arabian or Saharan Dromedary? Or do you prefer the more exotic two-humped Bactrian? Such is the nail biting excitement.&#10;All the other animals have died and all you can buy are camels. There are three types and they come in groups of one to four. The cards are then numbered 1 to 9, the higher the number, the more camels. Your camels are worth more if you have the largest herd (most cards of a type), a train (sequence of three or more) or a 'Big Three' (three cards of the same number). All in all it's difficult to know how much cards are worth - but that's what makes for a good bidding game.&#10;&#10;Bidding is just one round, so the last bidder has a big advantage. The only way to counter this is by 'Spitting' . You play your spit token and get an extra bid after the last bid. You can only do this once. Once all the spit tokens are played, you're left calculating how much money players have got left . The player purchasing the last card, bids first in the next round. This player enjoys the title of Space Merchant&#10;The winner is the person who has the most money when the game ends!&#10;&#10;";1999;5.29167;2.0
1887;Legend of the Five Rings;"A collectible card game, set in a fantasy empire called Rokugan, based loosely upon medieval Japan and Japanese Mythology.&#10;&#10;The factions available have changed over the editions, but generally include the 7 Great Clans: Crab, Crane, Dragon, Lion, Phoenix, Scorpion, and Unicorn. Each has specific thematic elements, which are consistent across editions and descendant games.  The other currently legal factions include the Spider, Mantis, and an unaligned ronin stronghold.&#10;&#10;The Rokugan setting has been changed over the years by participation in the storyline tournaments for the L5R CCG.&#10;&#10;Legend of the Five Rings is different from other collectible card games due to the concept of Clan loyalty.  The Clans of the game are what you build your deck around, and the communities that have built up around the Crane Clan, Lion Clan, etc are the backbone of the game.  When you say &quot;I'm a Crab player&quot; you instantly find yourself with hundreds and thousands of clan-mates who are there to help you become a better player.  When one member of the Clan wins, all benefit.&#10;&#10;L5R was the first CCG to introduce cards that players directly influenced. These are still a core part of the game.&#10;&#10;The L5R CCG has spun off a number of related games: &#10;&#10;     Clan War, a miniatures game.&#10;     Diskwars: Legend of the Five Rings, a Rokugan-themed set of the Diskwars tabletop combat game.&#10;     Unpublished Prototype, an as-yet unpublished wargame set in Rokugan.&#10;     Legend of the Five Rings Roleplaying Game&#10;&#10;&#10;As of 2006, only the CCG and Clan War have had storyline tournaments. Though the RPG players have been heavily involved in the ongoing plot in recent years.&#10;&#10;In 2008, L5R held the first &quot;Mega-Game&quot; which incorporated various methods of competition for the Clans and their supporters, not only in CCG form, but in contests (art, writing, poster-design, etc.), community work (charity, fundraising, food-drives), and more. The Dragon Clan ultimately won the first mega-game, and as such earned the privilege of having the next Empress come from their clan.&#10;&#10;In 2009, L5R released its first graphic novel, Death at Koten, which also included exclusive story-themed cards for the CCG.&#10;&#10;Also in 2009, L5R released The Imperial Gift the first completely free expansion in CCG history.&#10;&#10;In 2010 L5R celebrated its 15th Anniversary with many major events, new prizes, more free cards, and a special flashback set that brought back some of the most popular cards in the history of the game. 2010 also saw the largest World Championships event at Gen Con in the past 7 years.&#10;&#10;2011 saw the release of War of Honor, an all new tile-based multiplayer format for L5R that comes with 4 pre-constructed decks.&#10;&#10;In september 2015, AEG and Fantasy Flight Games announced that FFG had bought the L5R brand from AEG and will relaunch the card game as a LCG (non-collectible), with significant rules changes and a new design. The game is to go on hiatus following the release of Evil Portents, the final expansion from AEG, and will be relaunched at Gencon 2017. FFG has also plans to continue the RPG at some point (in what form and with which ruleset is yet unknown).&#10;&#10;";1995;7.17396;3.2905
1889;Office Politics;"In Office Politics, players attempt to establish themselves as the dominant force in a company, which is represented as a pyramidal hierarchy of departments.&#10;&#10;Players weave their webs of influence through the company, starting from the bottom and spreading through the connections among departments.  To establish control over a department, a player must spend kudos (the game's currency) and he or she must outspend other players with similar interests.  Each player also has a deck of cards that can help them to establish control, or to hinder others from doing so.  Each controlled department gains the player income; higher level departments yield more kudos.&#10;&#10;Once a player controls twelve departments, he or she is declared the winner and the game ends.&#10;&#10;";1995;5.5625;0.0
1890;Plateau;"Each playing piece has colored rings attached to its top and bottom faces; the color of the ring that's showing indicates how the piece moves. At the start of your move, you can flip the top piece in a stack over, changing how that piece moves. And your opponent isn't allowed to look underneath your pieces to see what might be there.  With this significant bluffing aspect, tied to the transformation of units, as well as two very different ways to win, Plateau is a unique abstract strategy game.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     Boardspace.net (real-time or turn based)&#10;     GamesByEmail.com (turn-based)&#10;&#10;&#10;Mobile Apps&#10;&#10;     Boardspace.net local multiplayer or online, IOS&#10;     Boardspace.net local multiplayer or online, Android&#10;&#10;&#10;";1986;7.17802;2.7273
1891;Portal;"Portal is a 'stripped-down' version of Magic: the Gathering designed to appeal to new players.  While the game retained some of the features of the original game, it also removed a number of abilities and interactions deemed too confusing for the novice player.  Though a number of the cards in portal were direct counterparts to cards in the regular-run of Magic: the Gathering, gone were named abilities like Trample, Banding, -walk (though Three Kingdoms did add the ability &quot;Horsemanship&quot;, which is almost but not quite flying).  Additionally, the game cut back on cards that could be played on another player's turn (i.e. instants and interrupts), leading to a greater focus on creatures and not spell interactions to achieve victory.&#10;&#10;Portal cards are recognizable from core and expansion sets of Magic: the Gathering by the expansion symbol, as well as a bolder and larger font in the text box, and symbols next to the attack and defense numbers of creatures.&#10;&#10;Portal was printed in three editions:&#10;&#10;     Portal&#10;     Portal Second Age&#10;     Portal Three Kingdoms (with an Eastern/Chinese theme)&#10;&#10;&#10;";1997;6.08773;2.0
1893;Traffic Lights;"Many variants on the concept of noughts and crosses exist. This version was created by Alan Parr. It is played on a 3x3 or 3x4 board with a supply of red, yellow, and green markers. The object is to get a line of three of the same color.&#10;&#10;On each turn, you may do ONE of the following:&#10;&#10;(1) Put a red counter in an empty square.&#10;(2) Replace a red counter with a yellow one.&#10;(3) Replace a yellow counter with a green one.&#10;&#10;So ultimately the board will fill with green counters.&#10;&#10;According to the book &quot;What's your Game&quot; by Michael Cornelius &amp; Alan Parr, the game is a first player win with perfect play.&#10;&#10;";1985;4.90435;2.3333
1894;War Galley: Naval Warfare in the Ancient World;"(from GMT website):&#10;&#10;War Galley is the seventh volume in the multi-award winning Great Battles of History (GBoH) series, but the first to venture entirely into the waters of the Mediterranean Sea. It is also the first historical boardgame published, in two decades, to address galley warfare. As such, GMT's War Galley is almost a complete history for this era of war at sea.&#10;&#10;What is best about War Galley is how easy it is to play -- the rules are about half the length of the usual GBoH game -- and that means that most battles can be complete in several hours, at the most. The battles themselves, cover all aspects of galley tactics, from the line against line of big ships at Salamis (Cyprus), to the Chase, Turn and Fight of Chios, to the Line Astern vs. Line Abreast at Side, to probably the most unusual of all ancient battles, the Roman arrowhead against the Carthaginian Lines Astern at Drepanum in 249 B.C.&#10;&#10;War Galley wars and battles covered by the scenarios are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Ionian Revolt- Lade, 494 BC&#10;     Peloponnesian War- Arginusae, 406 BC&#10;     The Silician Wars- Catana, 397 BC&#10;     The First Successor War- Salamis, 306 BC (Cyprus)&#10;     The First Punic War&#10;         Ecnomus, 256 BC&#10;         Drepanum, 249 BC&#10;         Aegatian Islands, 242 BC &#10;    &#10;     The Macedonian Wars- Chios, 201 BC&#10;     The War with Antiochus&#10;         Side, 190 BC&#10;         Myonessus, 190 BC &#10;    &#10;     The Civil War&#10;         Tauris, 47 BC&#10;         Naulochus, 36 BC&#10;         Actium, 31 BC &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;";1999;7.10933;3.125
1895;Salamis;"Add-on module for War Galley: Naval Warfare in the Ancient World.&#10;&#10;Salamis, one of the most famous naval battles in history, was a direct result of the Persian need to keep their large, invading army supplied by controlling the sea lanes. With Xerxes' army temporarily delayed at Thermopylae, the Greek fleet, based at Artemisium, some 50 miles or so directly east of Thermopylae, took the opportunity to attempt to stop the Persians from extending this Line of Communications. In a battle that appears to have extended over two or three days, the Greeks managed to eke out a slim tactical win. However, when Thermopylae fell, Themistocles' position became untenable, and the Greek fleet retreated to anchorage in the narrow channel of the Bay of Eleusis, west of Athens, at Salamis.&#10;&#10;With her naval flanks secured, the Persians rolled into lower Greece, capturing Athens and razing the town. However, to complete his subjugation of Greece, Xerxes had to destroy their fleet. To that end, the Persians sailed to a position south of Salamis.&#10;&#10;At Artemisium the Greeks had learned that, while their crews and marines were superior, the huge disparity in numbers could be telling. Unless they could neutralize this Persian strength.&#10;&#10;To that end, Themistocles lured the huge Persian fleet to attack the Greeks in the Bay of Eleusis, whose entrances were so restrictive as to negate any numerical superiority.&#10;&#10;There were two entrances to the bay. To plug up the western escape hatch, Xerxes dispatched his crack Egyptian squadron. Upon hearing this, Adeimantus and his Corinthians peeled off from the main fleet and sailed to the western mouth to block any Egyptian attempt to gain entrance. This &quot;action&quot; appears to have been a stand off, with both sides &quot;blockading&quot; and not fighting.&#10;&#10;At the eastern entrance, the Greeks deployed in three lines, along a narrow front of about 1800 yards, thus negating Persian numerical superiority. The Persians entered the bay in three long lines astern, which they then turned into nine lines abreast.&#10;&#10;The result was a boarding battle, and this was where the Greeks shone. Despite having half the manpower per ship of the Persians, their weaponry, armor and land-based tactics were superior to that of the Persians. And that superiority resulted in a smashing Greek victory.&#10;&#10;Xerxes retired to Thessaly, to try again the next year. The result was a great Greek victory, on land, at Plataea, followed by the Greek victory that completely cut Persian Lines of Communication, at Mycale.&#10;&#10;(from GMT website)&#10;&#10;";1999;6.94286;3.1053

The various pieces are different and can represent a multitude of things so that the game is different every time you play. In addition to the board and the ships that move on it, there are cards. Players may buy cards allowing special actions above and beyond the normal game, like an extra move or more EPs.&#10;&#10;Using your faction's wealth and resources you play the game and explore the map. You search for planets to colonize and possibly conquer. Use your fleets to engage in battles and use characters to assist you in reaching your faction's goals. The choices are yours and will decide if your faction is successful.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.05128;2.5714
1907;International Movie Maker;"You are a film producer and your aim is to make top quality, successful movies that will gross the most money possible at the box office.&#10;&#10;You run around the board trying to collect a Story, a Director, a Male and a Female Film Star and of course the relevant number of Locations.  You have a choice of Epic, Historical, Comedy, Musical, Western or Horror films, and each Star is best cast in a particular type of movie.  Directors are of varying quality as well.  The number of Locations required also depends on the film type.  The bigger your production, the greater its money making potential.&#10;&#10;Borrowing from Monopoly, there are also Distribution Company squares that act sort of like the Water or Electric Companies; the income from the Distribution Companies is raked in every time a player stops on such a square, and increases with that player's filmography.&#10;&#10;The rest of the board is the expected Oscar or Flop, Star Trouble, Retake, Director Loss, etc.&#10;&#10;A light, reasonably fun game.&#10;&#10;";1968;6.62224;1.3846
1908;G.O.O.T.M.U.;"G.O.O.T.M.U. (Get Out of the Maze Unit) is a maze game.  The board set up with a number of tiles.  You are trying to pick up all three parts of your GOOTMU so you can leave and win the game.&#10;&#10;You move by rolling a die, and when you end your turn on a space with an instruction on it, you must follow it.  Some objects are in the maze that allow you to avoid or destroy some obstacles (water puts out fire, oil allows you to slide through tight gaps, keys open locked doors, etc.).  On a 6, you may elect to rotate the tile you are on or an adjacent tile to improve your position.  Power tokens found in the maze allow you to rotate a tile or pick the number on the die.&#10;&#10;";1992;5.5344;1.4375
1909;Nomadi;"A game of moving camels across the desert. Each player has a number of camels and tries to get them across the desert first. However no-one survives in the desert alone - each camel must always be adjacent to at least one other camel.&#10;&#10;The game board depicts a desert with a starting area in one corner and a finish area in the opposite corner. There are two oasis spaces in the middle of the desert and a gorge which approximately splits the desert in two.&#10;&#10;After the initial placement of the pieces in the starting area, each player rolls all six of the dice, and moves whichever camels they want - restricted by the rule that a camel may never be by itself, but must have at least another camel in one of the 4 adjacent spaces (diagonal spaces do not count). The die roll determines how a camel may move: A 1 allows one space of diagonal or horizontal movement; a 2,3,or 4 allows the camel to move in a straight line (but not diagonally) that many spaces - it may also jump over any intervening camels; a 5 or 6 allows the camel to move that number of spaces and allows one right angle turn in the move - it may also jump over any intervening pieces.&#10;&#10;Being the first person to move a camel onto an oasis earns the player bonus points, and also being the first person to move a camel past the gorge likewise earns a player bonus points. These bonus points are added to the points earned by your camel's finishing position (ie 8 points to the first camel to get to the finish line, 6 for the second camel and 4 for the third).&#10;&#10;The person with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;";1995;5.51724;1.5
1910;Venice Connection;"Venice Connection is a river-building / tile-placement game for two players. Your goal is to complete the canal in a loop. The game consists of 16 identical tiles, each with a straight section of canal on one side and a bend on the other. All the tiles are available for either player to use, and on a turn you place 1-3 tiles connected in a straight line adjacent to at least one other tile already in play (except on the first turn when you just place these tiles on the table).&#10;&#10;If during the course of the game, one player notices that the canal is now impossible to complete, they say &quot;impossible&quot; to the challenged player (who placed on the previous turn), who now must try to finish the canal alone. If the canal can be completed, the challenged player has won; if not, the challenger has won!&#10;&#10;";1988;5.93211;1.6364
1911;Hollywood for Sale;"This is a card game of bluffing and auctioning various paraphernalia pertaining to Hollywood or actors/actresses. The game contains a stack of cards each depicting an item to be auctioned with the value of the item printed on the card. The cards either are very valuable (6-12) or are fakes, and are worth nothing (0) or very little (4-5). there is also an end of game card.&#10;&#10;The game begins with each person receiving 2 million dollars from the bank. The end of game card is shuffled into the bottom of the deck, and the deck is then placed face down on the table. The dealer looks at the top card and places the first bid on the item. Each player then in turn may either bid or pass. Once a person passes, they may not re-enter the bidding. The player with the highest bid pays the bank and receives the item - placing it face-up in front of him.&#10;&#10;If the card is a 0,4, or 5 and is sold for more than 300,000, the auctioneer receives $100,000 from the bank.&#10;&#10;The game then continues with the next player in clockwise order from the auctioneer looking at the next card and beginning the next auction round.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the &quot;game end&quot; card is drawn. The players then add up the values of their cards and the player whose items are the most valuable wins the game. Money has no value in the final scoring.&#10;&#10;";1994;5.425;0.0
1912;World Cup Tournament Football;"This is really a card game disguised in a rather large box. The object of the game is to get your team through the qualifying for the (soccer) World Cup, and hopefully win.&#10;&#10;The game has a board which depicts a a bunch of soccer fields - just placeholders for the cards played in the &#10;tournament: from 16 fields for the first elimination round and the 8 fields for the round of 16, up to the one field used for the finals. There is also a deck of cards for each of the teams involved in the game with two sets of numbers printed on the card depicting the number of goals scored and the number of penalties given to that team. Finally there are counters depicting the 32 teams in the tournament.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with five random cards and the team counters are randomly distributed to each of the players (showing which team each player will 'manage'). Each team is rated either as 0, 1, or 2 - this is the 'bonus' number of goals that team will score in each match it plays.&#10;&#10;Each player in turn can play a card onto any soccer field. On the preliminary matches (fields), the cards are placed face-up (maximum of 3 cards), on any other field, the card is placed face-down. Once all the fields are full, the matches are resolved with the winner of the match going on to the next. Once the preliminary matches are resolved and the teams determined for the next round, those cards are flipped over and the results determined. This is done all the way to the finals.&#10;&#10;A player can determine where his team will end up playing each subsequent match and play cards face-down to try to get his team to win, but if your team is upset early - all those face-down cards that you played are now going to help some other team and not yours.&#10;&#10;";1993;6.37727;1.6667
1913;Transsib;"Transsib (later Published by Winsome) is a game about mafia gangs selling goods during a journey on the Transsiberian Railway.&#10;&#10;The board depicts the Transsiberian Railway and a few of the stations along it - starting at Irkusk and ending in Moscow. There is also a picture of 6 green passenger cars and one restaurant car, and finally there is a table which lists all the goods and the value of each at each of the different stations.&#10;&#10;Your goal is to sell your goods for the highest profit you can while keeping your mobsters alive and thwarting your opponents from selling their goods.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game each player gets 12 goods cards which must be placed in that player's compartments in the railway train. During the game if you sell a good of that type you remove the corresponding good card from one of your compartments.&#10;&#10;The game is divided into moving rounds (2 in between each station) and selling rounds (when the train is at a station). During a moving round a player can move one of his mobsters, steal an item from another player, seek protection money from another player which may lead to a duel, or attack another player's mobster (the loser in a duel or attack is removed from the train).&#10;During a selling round, a player may sell items from a train car that contains one of his mobsters. Sold good cards are removed from the game and protection money is paid if owed.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the train reaches Moscow and the final selling round is done. The player with the most money wins the game.&#10;&#10;";1996;5.64189;2.3333
1914;Im 7. Himmel;"The object of the game is to reach 7th heaven with the correct partner figure.&#10;&#10;The game board shows the pathway to 7th Heaven divided up into many spaces. Each player takes a partner figure and places it on the start space. The 6 partner cards are shuffled and each player takes one - this card shows which partner you want/need in order to get into the 7th heaven. (Partners are not the fellow players at the table - but the chosen partner card of the same color as the wooden piece).&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt 12 sympathy cards. These cards are played on your turn and are used to move or exchange a partner figure. There are 3 different types of sympathy cards: the cards with the numbers are used to move the corresponding colord figure on the board; the cards with an arrow moves the corresponding piece forward to the space of another playing piece; finally the cards with the text are played and the actions carried out immediately.  Alternatively, each numbered or arrowed sympathy card can be used to exchange partner cards with another player.&#10;&#10;The game starts with a player playing a numbered Sympathy Card and moving the corresponding piece forward that number of spaces, then drawing a new card. The next player then takes his turn, etc. Play continues in this manner - moving or swapping pieces until a player is able to get to the finish (7th Heaven) while holding the correct colored partner card for his playing piece. If no-one makes it to 7th Heaven, the game ends when the last sympathy card is played. The winner in that case is the player with the correct partner card who is closest to 7th Heaven.&#10;&#10;";1989;4.63333;1.6667
1915;Middle-earth;"ICE's now-out-of-print CCG (they lost their license to produce Middle-Earth products in 1999). Players take the role of the Istari, or Wizards - most familiarly Gandalf, Saruman, and Radagast, but also Pallando and Alatar - in the  struggle against Sauron in Middle-Earth. Each player competes to bring the greatest strength to bear against the Shadow, including Factions such as the Riders of Rohan or the Great Eagles, allies like Gwaihir or Shadowfax, items such as the lost Palantiri, Glamdring, or Narsil, and the completion of various quests - from the relatively straightforward rescue of prisoners through the involved Reforging of the Sword that was Broken, restoration of the White Tree to Minas Tirith, or the quest of quests, the destruction of the One Ring.&#10;&#10;Players build decks in which half are composed of resource cards and half of hazards, dedicated to the stopping of your opponent. This is where the big bad guys come in, with cards for the 9 Nazgul, a couple of Dragons (Smaug being the recognizable one), Shelob, and the Balrog.&#10;&#10;";1995;7.35656;3.7364
1916;Shuttles;"From the box:&#10;Shuttles is a game of strategy for two players, ages 8 to adult. By moving playing pieces and game board sliders, players maneuver around variable barriers in a race to be the first to reach their goal. This challenging game develops strategic thinking skills, and by solving strategy problems, helps children to develop solutions to real-life problems.&quot;&#10;&#10;The board is made up of nine or seven horizontal rows (&quot;sliders&quot;) containing various combinations of holes and barriers. The players start with five pegs each, on opposite ends of the board, and attempt to be the first to get all of their pegs to the other side. On a turn, the player can either move a peg orthogonally as far as they want without crossing a boundary, or they can move one of the rows left or right, shifting the location of the holes and barriers in an attempt to block their opponent's moves or open a path for their own pegs.&#10;&#10;";1973;5.73746;1.625
1917;Stratego;"Stratego by Jumbo is the most well-known of this type of hidden tactics board games. It was launched just after World War II in 1946 and has led to a variety of various themed versions and spinoff variations.&#10;&#10;This game is very similar to, and almost certainly derived directly from, the Gibsons game L'Attaque who had acquired the UK rights in 1925 from the game&rsquo;s creator Mademoiselle Hermance Edan who launched it in France in 1909. It is not exactly the same, but not far from it (numbered pieces, spy (same name) can kill the strongest piece but only when attacking, flag, bombs, etc.) The game in turn likely drew on various ancient Chinese board games such as Lu Zhan Jun Qi or the classic children's game Jungle.&#10;&#10;From the box:&#10;&#10;The gameboard is your battlefield.  You have an army of men at your disposal and six bombs.  Your mission--protect your flag and capture your opponent's flag.&#10;&#10;Secretly place your men, bombs, and flag on the gameboard with these objectives in mind.  But remember your opponent is doing the same thing, so you must plan a defense as well as an offense.&#10;&#10;Once the armies are in place, advance your men.  When you're one space away from an enemy, attack.  You and your opponent declare ranks.  The lower-ranking man is captured and out of play.&#10;&#10;You control your pieces and risk your men in battles where the strength of your enemy is unknown. The suspense builds as your men move deeper into enemy territory. Move with caution and courage. The next piece you attack could be a bomb.  And when attacked, it could &quot;blast&quot; your man off the board and out of play.&#10;&#10;The first to capture an enemy flag is the winner!&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;     Stratego (Revised Edition) (aka Stratego Fire &amp; Ice)&#10;     The Generals&#10;     Stratego Legends&#10;     Stratego: Star Wars&#10;     Stratego: Lord of the Rings Trilogy Edition&#10;     Ultimate Stratego&#10;     Electronic Stratego&#10;     Stratego: Marvel Heroes&#10;     Stratego: Star Wars Saga Edition&#10;     Stratego: The Chronicles of Narnia &#226;&#128;&#147; The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe&#10;&#10;&#10;and numerous others.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    L'Attaque&#10;    Dover Patrol&#10;    Aviation: The Aerial Tactics Game of Attack and Defence&#10;    Battle of Britain (Gibsons English fifth edition)&#10;    Tri-Tactics&#10;    Sharpe's Attack&#10;    Jeu de la Quille&#10;    Admirals&#10;    Attack&#10;    Batalj&#10;    Game of the Generals&#10;    Lu Zhan Jun Qi (Land Army Chess)&#10;    Hai Lu Kong Zhan Qi (Sea-Land-Air Fighting Chess)&#10;    Si Guo Da Zhan (The Great Battle of Four Countries)&#10;    Jungle (&#233;&#172;&#165;&#231;&#141;&#184;&#230;&#163;&#139; (d&ograve;u sh&ograve;u q&iacute;) or &ldquo;Animal Chess&rdquo;)&#10;    Dong Wu Qi (&#229;&#139;&#149;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#230;&#163;&#139; or &ldquo;Animal Game&quot;)&#10;&#10;&#10;Different Edition Complications&#10;When first produced in Europe, the most powerful pieces had higher numbers.  I.e. the Marshall (most powerful piece) was a 10, the General was a 9, and so on.  The higher the rank, the higher the number.&#10;When they introduced Stratego in the USA, the numbering was reversed, so the Marshall was a 1, the General 2, and so on.  The 1st rank (most powerful) was 1, the second most powerful was 2, 3rd most powerful was 3....&#10;Then, in 2000s Hasbro re-imagined Stratego in the USA and made a few changes.  They reduced the number of pieces per side (from 40 to 30), added additional powers, and changed the numbering to reflect the European system.&#10;This caused extreme consternation with many faithful American Stratego fans who preferred the 'old way'.  (Actually the second oldest way, but whatever.)  Many of these insist on playing Stratego with the 'Marshall 1 system'.&#10;This wouldn't be a problem, except any and all discussions of Stratego are fraught with misunderstandings by those who are unaware of dual numbering systems!  Keep this in mind when reading information about Stratego.&#10;&#10;";1946;6.14802;1.8426

1920;The Business Game;"Board of two joined leaves, 12 mine derricks (2 of each of 6 colours), 6 lorries [trucks], 5 barges, 2 ships, 90 pyramids (15 of each of 6 colours), 24 cubes (4 of each of 6 colours), 26 production cards, 6 Canal Company Title Deeds, 2 production debit cards, 1 die, sterling and dollar currency.&#10;&#10;The players are operating a mine and trying to get the ore to market, but must compete with each other for the limited transportation resources.  The ore has to be transported initially by lorries and also later by barges to the coastal warehouse.  All transport has to be hired and there is always less transport available than required, favouring those who are prepared to take a risk on achieving a quick journey without mishap.  For example there are only 5 barges (always one less than the numbers of players) to encourage competition and load sharing.  You can also force other players to pay you for taking their ore to make up a barge load as all barges have to travel fully laden.  Much depends on how long a journey takes.  New ore can only be obtained by throwing a 1 or a six which also triggers the playing of a production card which can be favourable or not.&#10;&#10;From the coastal warehouse, barges and ships are used to transport ore out to sea to foreign ports to sell to gradually earn the Million Dollars needed to win the game.  The second set of money (dollars) is thus actually a victory point counting device and not actual currency (i.e. it cannot be spent).&#10;&#10;It works well with any number of players (when playing with a smaller complement, each player operates multiple mines) except five, as the competition factor on one side of the board is uneven with the other.&#10;&#10;";1965;5.93379;2.0789
1921;Sovereign of the Seas;"It is a game of naval shipping and trading set in the late 17th early 19th century.  The board is a map of Europe and of the many areas where the European powers had colonies (Africa, Asia, Carribean, N &amp; S. America).  There are 32 ports depicted on the map and the shipping lanes connecting the ports.  Also in the game are cargo charts - which show what goods are sold in each of the ports, port cards which list the ports and the price to buy the port, destination cards which list a port (some ports have more than 1 card depending on how busy that port was in real life), and cargo cards which represent each of the 9 types of goods in the game, and finally weather and pirate random event cards.&#10;&#10;The game starts by all players drawing destination cards and a cargo card.  You then roll the dice and move your ship from your home port to a port that sells the trade good that you need which you then buy and transport to the destination port.  During the game all ports can be bought and if owned you have to pay a premium to the owner if you use that port.  You win by collecting 150,000.&#10;&#10;";1979;5.35667;2.0

Grab the treasure and run.&#10;&#10;Admit it. You love it.&#10;&#10;This award-winning card game, designed by Steve Jackson, captures the essence of the dungeon experience... with none of that stupid roleplaying stuff. You and your friends compete to kill monsters and grab magic items. And what magic items! Don the Horny Helmet and the Boots of Butt-Kicking. Wield the Staff of Napalm... or maybe the Chainsaw of Bloody Dismemberment. Start by slaughtering the Potted Plant and the Drooling Slime, and work your way up to the Plutonium Dragon...&#10;&#10;And it's illustrated by John Kovalic! Fast-playing and silly, Munchkin can reduce any roleplaying group to hysteria. And, while they're laughing, you can steal their stuff.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;OtherPart of the Munchkin series.&#10;&#10;Munchkin is a satirical card game based on the clich&eacute;s and oddities of Dungeons and Dragons and other role-playing games. Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.&#10;&#10;There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels.  Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.&#10;&#10;In May 2010, Steve Jackson Games made the &quot;big announcement.&quot; Many rules and cards were changed. See The Great 2010 Munchkin Changeover for details. Of note to Munchkin fans, the Kneepads of Allure card, which had been removed in the 14th printing, was added back to the game but modified to be less powerful.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Sequels:&#10;    The Good, the Bad, and the Munchkin&#10;    Munchkin Apocalypse&#10;    Munchkin Axe Cop&#10;    Munchkin Bites!&#10;    Munchkin Booty&#10;    Munchkin Conan&#10;    Munchkin Cthulhu&#10;    Munchkin Fu&#10;    Munchkin Impossible&#10;    Munchkin Legends&#10;    Munchkin Pathfinder&#10;    Munchkin Zombies&#10;    Star Munchkin&#10;    Super Munchkin&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Related Board Games&#10;    Munchkin Quest&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Online play&#10;     Vassal does not support Munchkin anymore.

1929;Bushido Denied: The Battles of Bataan and Corregidor;"Bushido Denied is a wargame of the WWII campaign fought for the control of the Philippine Islands from January to May, 1942. The Japanese player is attempting to wrest control of the Bataan Peninsula and the Corregidor Island fortress from the American player as quickly and efficiently as possible. The Japanese 14th Army high command thought the entire Philippine campaign would last 4-6 weeks. Instead the campaign lasted nearly 6 months.&#10;&#10;Although these battles resulted in the only time an entire American Army, with over 76,000 men surrendered, the Japanese victory was a phyric one. General Matsuharu Homma never again held a field command. American and Filipino valor denied the Japanese the quick and decisive victory they planned.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS:&#10;&#10;     2 different 11x17 inch maps represent the battlefields of the Bataan peninsula and Corregidor island&#10;     2 sheets totaling 280 double sided counters (one for Bataan and the other for Corregidor) show the forces controlled by each player and markers.&#10;     One rulebook&#10;     3 Charts and table sheets &#10;&#10;&#10;";2000;7.1;3.3333
1930;Anti-Monopoly III: Washington-Moskau;"Each of the players represents a Nuclear Power.  The aim of the game is to maintain world peace and avoid nuclear war.  An &quot;Arms Spiral&quot; is in the middle of the board, representing the arms race.  When the &quot;BOMB&quot; arrives at the end of the Arms Spiral, world peace is over and everyone has lost!  However, if all players work together in such a way that one reaches the &quot;World Peace&quot; space, then the arms race is over.  All players have won and the one who has contributed the most to maintaining world peace is declared winner.&#10;&#10;To prevent destruction each player must simultaneously pursue his own goals as well co-operate with the other players to maintain peace.  Each one can pursue his personal selfish goal to come to a victory, but this promotes the arms race.&#10;&#10;The American version of this game is called Star Peace: Anti Nuclear War.&#10;&#10;";1987;4.0;1.0
1931;Anti-Monopoly;"(Note: Not to be confused with Anti-Monopoly II. Please be careful when submitting new versions of this game; basically, anything published after 1987 will almost certainly be Anti-Monopoly II and belong to that game, even if it's called &quot;Anti-Monopoly&quot;. As for the reasons why this is so, please see the clarifications at the end of this article and the article of Anti-Monopoly II.)&#10;&#10;The &quot;Bust~the~Trust!&quot; Game&#10;&#10;The basic idea of the game is to end the monopolistic practices of the 3-company-combinations of the game board. The players are Trust-Busting lawyers going about the board slapping lawsuits on the monopolies. The winning trust buster is the one who ends with the largest number of social-credit points when one of the players runs out of money.&#10;&#10;There are 3 kinds of company combinations on the board: Oligopolies, Trusts and Monopolies, marked by one, two and three &quot;accusation circles&quot; respectively. &quot;Accusing&quot; is done by placing a small, round chip of the same color as your token on such a circle. When all accusation circles of a combination are covered, the monopolistic practices of that combination have been ended. An accusation chip can be bought from the &quot;Budget-Commissioner&quot;; when lending money, he provides a Social-Credit card as an IOU.&#10;&#10;Variant rules are supplied for a Low-Budget Game and a Trading Game.&#10;&#10;Anspach fought --and won-- a vicious court battle against Hasbro (and others) over this game.&#10;&#10;Anti-Monopoly was briefly (1976-1982) published as &quot;Anti&quot; and &quot;Anti-Monopoly II&quot; was published as &quot;Choice&quot; whilst the company was forbidden to use the word &quot;Monopoly&quot;. In 1984 after prevailing in court the company used the names &quot;Anti-Monopoly&quot; and &quot;Anti-Monopoly II&quot; for its two games.  In 1987, Anti-Monopoly was withdrawn and Anti-Monopoly II was renamed &quot;Anti-Monopoly&quot;.  The game described here was produced as Anti-Monopoly before 1976 and from 1984 thru 1987.  The game produced as Anti-Monopoly after 1987 is a different game, with the same name. Plenty of potential for confusion there, eh?&#10;&#10;";1973;3.70424;1.6341
1932;Anti-Monopoly II;"(Note: Not to be confused with the original Anti-Monopoly, even though recent versions of Anti-Monopoly II are called simply &quot;Anti-Monopoly&quot;. As for the reasons why this is so, please see the clarifications at the end of this article and the article of Anti-Monopoly.)&#10;&#10;In this game the players follow either the rules for Monopolists or those for Competitors. Competitors charge fair rents, build as soon as they own a property, place four houses (green) at the most, after which they build a hotel (red) and occasionally go to Price War. On the other hand, Monopolists extort monopoly-high rents from their poor tenants, build only after they have at least two streets of one color, restrict supply by putting only three houses on their properties, after which they also are allowed to build a hotel (red) and occasionally go to prison!&#10;&#10;The good guys are the small entrepreneurs and the bad guys are the monopolists. Since players do not play by the same rules, fairness is achieved by a win probability equalization technique (which is where the second author comes in).&#10;&#10;Competitors make more money than Monopolists in the beginning of the game but Monopolists can catch up later, especially if Competitors don't watch their money!&#10;&#10;The game was first published as &quot;Choice&quot; because Anspach was forbidden to use the word &quot;Monopoly&quot; by the courts. When that was overturned in 1983, the name was changed to &quot;Anti-Monopoly II&quot;. In 1987, believing that consumer confusion between Anti-Monopoly and Anti-Monopoly II was harming sales of the latter game, Anspach ceased the production of the original game and removed the &quot;II&quot; from the name of the latter game.&#10;&#10;";1977;3.74221;1.5
1933;Key to the Kingdom;"The aim is to go around the game board until you've found the &quot;Key treasure card&quot; plus one more treasure card and then escape the kingdom. You may also steal treasures from the other players.&#10;&#10;From the beginning you have 8 different equipment cards, which you need to use to pass traps or defeat monsters. Sometimes you might lose 1 or more of your pieces of equipment, but there's a possibility to get them back at a couple of places on the board.&#10;&#10;The most remarkable thing about this game is that the board is in 6 parts, connected with roads in many combinations, The only way of reaching two of the parts is by jumping into one of the whirlpools in the middle of the board, This allows the board to be folded in or out to another board. There are rules to handle the other players if they get caught on the folded board.&#10;&#10;";1990;5.55223;1.587
1934;Up & Down;"In Up &amp; Down players try to have the best combination of cards at the end of the game. One can aim at having all cards in his hand neutralised which gives 50 points. In all other cases one just has to add all values of the cards owned when the game ends. The gameplay is based on actions - one of which a player must choose in his turn: neutralising cards lying on the table, discarding or drawing. Number of cards drawn or discarded depends on what cards lie on the table.&#10;&#10;One gameplay is very short but the rules suggest that the game should be played several times with results written down and summed up.&#10;&#10;";1996;4.72456;1.0

The sea voyages take you along one of three routes. The routes are of decreasing length, opportunity, and, in some cases, risk. The routes are made up of a series of Unknown Islands, stops in the Known Lands, and trade ports. Movement distance is determined by the roll of a die with the choice of the route going to each Sindbad.&#10;&#10;The adventure cards you draw may be used to help you defeat monsters, opponents or events.&#10;&#10;The aim is to collect a fortune of a million Mischals and get back to Basra, by fighting monsters or trading in different cities.&#10;&#10;";1990;6.1506;1.5238
1941;SjÃ¶rÃ¶varÃ¶n;"Sj&ouml;r&ouml;var&ouml;n (&quot;Corsair Island&quot;) is a truly classic childrens game from Sweden, which was published by BRIO for a first time in the mid-1950's and sold for some 5-10 years. Later Joker (BRIO's board game division) would re-release the game in the early 1980's, followed by Alga in around 1985 (when Alga had been purchased by BRIO and replaced Joker as the companys board game arm.) It is now out-of-print.&#10;&#10;The game is played in three stages. In the first stage you have to take the map pieces from the other players.&#10;&#10;Second stage: When you have all the pieces, you know where the treasure is located (since you would know which part Captain Kidd has swallowed = missing) and you can rush away to the hidden place to get the treasure chest.&#10;&#10;In the third and last stage, you have to run away, either with the raft or with one of the rowing boats the player arrived with. All the time the other player can get the map pieces or the chest from you, so you need to be quick and careful.&#10;&#10;Of course the pirates may duel with pistols and shoot with the cannon - placed in the centre of the island - at each other!&#10;&#10;The game were sold with fine metal (tin) playing pieces: six pirates, a raft, a cannon and, of course, the treasure chest (fitted with a steel ring so it could be hung on the pirate playing piece representing who had custody of the treasure!).&#10;&#10;";1955;5.5;1.3333

If there are fewer players, specific cards are removed. Each player is dealt 12 cards.&#10;&#10;The start player calls a colour. Each player puts a  card in front of him/herself, face down. If you have a card of the called colour, you have to put down a card of that colour. If not, you can choose any of your cards.&#10;&#10;When all players have put down a card, each player decides if he/she wants to reveal his/her card, starting with the start player. You can only reveal your card if it is of the colour that was called. But if you have played a card in the called colour, you can choose to pretend you didn't and thus don't reveal your card.&#10;&#10;If nobody reveals a card, the caller stays in control. If any cards have been revealed, the player with the highest card takes over control.&#10;The player in control can choose between&#10;&#10;     continuing&#10;     ending the round&#10;     doubting a player.&#10;&#10;&#10;If the player in control continues, the same colour stays active and all players put a second card on top of the previous.&#10;If the player in control ends the round, the biggest liar is determined: the unrevealed cards are revealed and the player who played the highest card in the called colour gets an egg card. Then all played cards are put into a stack next to the player.&#10;If the player in control doubts a player, that player has to reveal his/her played card. If it is of the called colour, the doubted player must take all the played cards. If the player in control incorrectly doubts a player (i.e. they played a card in a different colour), the doubter must take all the played cards. Some cards have fried eggs printed on them, which count as negative points.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the last card has been played.&#10;Each egg card is worth 3 points, each fried egg on one of the cards a player has received counts as -1.

Many an interesting discussion -- and an occasional laugh or two -- takes place as players use logic and intuition in reaching their decisions.&#10;&#10;&quot;Will your decisions be just? Will you declare the 'Feral Financier' a public nuisance? How will you rule in the case of the IRS against the 'Self-Rising Sinner'? Can the 'Mixed-Up Marriage' be annulled? Was the 'Midnight Murder' really murder? Any number can play.

1971;Bump;"In Bump: the Sneaky Numbers Game, players are given a hand of cards, and play those to a common pile, hoping to bring the count to one of several target numbers.  Going over (or under with a negative card) the target number costs money, but hitting it dead on wins $2,000.  Money can also be claimed by bumping other players.  First to win $10,000 wins the game.&#10;&#10;";1990;3.66667;1.0

1979;Da Capo!;"Played with a giant deck of 150 cards numbered 1-10 and 18 joker cards.&#10;Players have individual card stacks of which only the top card is open. The goal of the game is to get rid of one's entire stack first. This is achieved by putting cards down on stacks in the middle of the table. Those stacks have to be in numerical order, starting with 1 and finishing with 10 (there are Joker cards to fill gaps). The players also have their own individual stacks on which they can put open cards for later use.&#10;&#10;Republished by Amigo in 2009 under the name Da Capo, with only 15 Jokers included (and with a new design).&#10;&#10;";1993;4.58929;1.0

1983;Frontier-6;"You visit frontier towns as you go around the outer track, and you can buy up parts of them (bank, saloon, etc.) to secure revenue.  Whenever you visit the Bank, you have the option of holding it up, in which case the game switches to a different mode, which uses the inside of the board.  This shows a map of the Far West --you are now an outlaw on that map, running for the border.  Those of the other players that want to are also put on the map as bounty hunters.  Once the chase is resolved --one way or another-- the pieces return to the outer track.&#10;&#10;";1980;6.40385;1.875
1985;Overturn;"From the designers of Othello.&#10;&#10;Overturn sports a modular board that changes with every game. It's kind of like a &quot;find the hidden word&quot; puzzles you used to play in the newspaper. Each player places colored rings over letters to make words. If you use the rings already placed by your opponent, you may turn the rings over to your color. Winner is the one with the most rings after all the letters have been used, or no more words can be made.&#10;&#10;Essentially Othello with words.&#10;&#10;1993 Mensa Select&#10;&#10;";1987;5.95978;1.6
1987;Emperor of China;"In this highly abstract strategic wargame, you are trying to conquer China by being the first to occupy fifteen provinces at the completion of a complete round of play (all players having had an equal number of turns).  Alternatively, the game can be timed and scored.&#10;&#10;You start with a small number of provinces under your control.  Population counters of your colour indicate this; if a province has extra population, it can move some into an adjacent unoccupied province --this is the simplest way of conquest.  Merger, diplomacy and force (Risk-like combat) are your other options.  Each turn you draw a Yin card and a Yang card.  Yin is bad, Yang is good.  Without looking at either card's instructions, you assign them to two of your provinces.  Yang will most likely increase your recruitment (which is normally three population per turn), but could also give you the capability to cross a natural barrier like a mountain range.  Yin will hurt you.  Some cards you end up holding in your hand.&#10;&#10;A player may attempt to convince another player to merge with his empire.  If the second player agrees then the smaller empire is absorbed by the larger and both players continue play as senior (larger) and junior (smaller) partners.  The absorbed empire no longer has a separate turn nor separate recruitment.  This concept of &quot;shared victory&quot; is intriguing, particularly with a larger number of players.&#10;&#10;The game allows any number of players but components are only provided for five.&#10;&#10;";1972;5.98644;2.0476
1989;The Peter Principle Game;"This game was published in the wake of the best-selling success of Dr. Peter's book &quot;The Peter Principle&quot; (oft-quoted as &quot;In a hierarchy, every employee tends to rise to his or her level of incompetence&quot;). In it, the players, employees of a huge corporation, compete to avoid promotion and remain competent (by taking more &quot;right&quot; decisions than &quot;wrong&quot; ones). At the same time, each tries to force the others into promotion or into &quot;deadwood&quot; status (which happens by accumulating enough wrong decisions and being found out). The last player still alive and competent is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;The game was originally published by Skor-Mor in 1973, but the 1981 AH edition is much easier to find.&#10;&#10;Skor-Mor published 3D puzzles and games in clear plastic such as Chess in the Third Dimension and a 3D Tic-Tac-Toe called Trinary. It disappeared in the early 1980s.&#10;&#10;A related game, theme-wise, is AH's Bureaucracy.&#10;&#10;";1973;4.07234;1.4

Players each choose their maneuvers, and then using a formula, turn to a new page in their book to see the outcome.&#10;&#10;";1990;6.35692;2.0
1993;Troke;"The sub-title for Troke is &quot;Castle Checkers&quot;.&#10;&#10;Abstract strategy game where players move three different kinds of pieces (tower, wall, and moat) across a board diagonally forward, straight ahead or sideways, but never backwards.  In some versions of the game, points are scored for capturing opponent's pieces and by forming complete &quot;castles&quot; (a tower, wall, and moat) on the player's goal line.  Otherwise it is a race to see who can get all their pieces to goal line. A feature of the game is that if you merge with one or two different pieces you take one or two extra moves.  You are allowed to merge (capture) with opponent&rsquo;s pieces and thus move them away from their goal and towards your own. Making moves becomes complicated as the game progresses because capturing pieces requires that additional moves be made. If these extra moves can not be made, then the original capture move can not be made.&#10;&#10;";1956;6.10313;2.125

When the triangular board is filled or all players are blocked the game is finished.&#10;&#10;The game contains 36 colored triangles, with all kinds of combinations. Triangles with fewer colors score more. All triangles must be placed adjacent to already placed triangles.

During each session, five elections take place followed by the formation of the government. The goal is to advance as far as possible in the parliament. Advancement comes, on the one hand, through luck (namely, your cards) and the way you use it, that is, playing the right cards at the right time, and, on the other hand, through skillful negotiation with your fellow players about posts and their related points. &#10;Success is measured in points. Each player has a sixth of the game field (the plenary hall) in front of him, his points are marked in the track of his color. After 15 elections, the strongest party-chairman wins; that is, the one with the most points.&#10;&#10;";1987;2.89474;2.0

Players try to cross the rope by finding the show cards corresponding to the shoe tokens.&#10;&#10;To set the game up, the 15 shoe tokens are shuffled and placed face down on the 15 spaces on the game board. Each player receives a number of cards which they place face down in a row in front of them. Each turn, all players turn their leftmost card face up and then pass them on to their left neighbor who places them face down at the right end of their row. The active player then tries to find the shoe card that shows the same shoe as the current shoe token. The further the player is from the start of the rope, the more cards he/she has to find.

2038;Skirrid;"Coming in a very awkward-sized box (42 x 42 x 3 cm), this is a distant relative of Scrabble. The 19x19 board is colored in two distinct areas, the central lozenge (just reaching the edges) being called the arena. The squares are sprinkled with numbers, of values increasing near the outer corners. The players have sets of 18 (for the two-player game) clear and smoked plastic of tangram shapes, some of which have a 2 or 3 over a certain square.&#10;&#10;Starting in the center, the players lay their pieces so as to score, adjacent to an existing piece. A piece normally scores the numbers it covers; if it has a number of its own and that number falls directly over a scoring square, they are multiplied. You can sacrifice a piece by playing it upside down; it scores half (rounding down) and the opponent isn't allowed to play a piece adjacent to the sacrificed piece on his next turn --this is a neat trick when approaching a high-scoring area. You cannot sacrifice on the first turn. You cannot play outside the arena until you've accumulated at least 75 in score.&#10;&#10;Score is kept with the help of tracking pieces on the outside edges of the game board.&#10;&#10;The playing tiles come in six different shapes, each with their own name:&#10;&#10;The Eye (covers 1 square);&#10;    The Rod (covers 2 squares);&#10;    The Quoin or Corner(covers 3 squares);&#10;    The Snake (covers 4 squares);&#10;    The Door (covers 5 squares);&#10;    The Gun (covers 6 squares).&#10;&#10;";1977;5.66953;2.0

The game ends when one player reaches his goal or when both players cannot make legal moves.&#10;&#10;The key game mechanism is that your move options are determined not by the three arrows on the tile under your (transparent) game piece, but by those under your opponent's piece. Thus, each move is chosen to try and limit your opponent's next as well as to try and guarantee yourself a good selection of choices. This adds an element of bluff and second-guessing to the game.&#10;&#10;The rules also include some variations to the two-player game that make the game easier or harder to finish.&#10;&#10;";1972;5.77367;2.1053
2041;They're at the Post;"From the Box:&#10;&quot;The exciting new game that captures all the fun and suspense of a day at the track.  8 complete races on 4 LP records computerized for over 190 different finishes.  The records are specially designed so that no one can pre-determine the race results.&#10;&#10;the voice of racing Daryl Wells&quot;&#10;&#10;This game plays just as being at the race track.  It includes racing programs, bet chits, banker's records and cash.  Any number of players can bet on the various horses for each race.  When the betting window is closed the LP is put on and the needle dropped and on comes the racing voice, excitingly giving a entire race breakdown.&#10;&#10;Each record has more than one spiral on them, so when the needle is placed, no one knows which race will play.&#10;&#10;";1975;6.69355;2.0
2043;Shogun;"Shogun: An exciting digital game.&#10;&#10;This game plays on a 8&times;8 grid, with each player having 7 pawns and 1 King, which start lined up on opposite sides of the board.  Each player can remove the other's pieces by moving onto them, as in chess.&#10;&#10;But what sets this game apart is that there is a window on each piece, which shows a number indicating the number of moves that piece can make.  And due to the working of many magnets under the board, the number automatically changes depending on which space the pawn or king is on.&#10;&#10;Each of the pawns responds differently on the board.  After several games the board can be rotated to keep the players guessing.&#10;&#10;";1976;5.78702;1.9231
2044;Non-Violent, Politically-Correct War;"War has dramatically changed over the years, but the card game that bears its name hasn't until now. For the first time, War incorporates Love, Peace, Diversity, and Unity. Players compete to get rid of their cards first, while trying to avoid the heavily-armed Joker (the weakest card in the deck).&#10;The key differences between this game and standard War are:&#10; - The Joker is the lowest card in the deck - it loses to every other card.&#10; - When players put down cards of the same rank, instead of having a &quot;war&quot; right away, they cooperate and by trading decks, then have a war.&#10; - The first player to get rid of all his/her cards wins.&#10;&#10;The suits are of different icons (peace symbols, unity symbols, hearts with an arrow through it, etc) from a normal deck of cards and the deck includes one blank card which can be used to replace a lost or damaged card OR create a new wild card.&#10;&#10;";1996;3.11422;1.0909
2045;Nomad;"(From The Rule Book Introduction)&#10;This is the lay of the land.&#10;&#10;This is the nature of the people who reside upon it.&#10;&#10;In the mountains live the people called the Neemahk. Who wear the thick woolly skins of the tiger and mammoth, and carry spears tipped with sharp, shiny, black rock. They are fierce warriors. But even better hunters.&#10;&#10;A day's journey downriver, at the edge of the forest there, live the men who call themselves the Treg. They have learned to reap the bounties of the water. They harvest&#10;the river with nets woven of soft, pliable reeds and roots; and make stories out of symbols painted on hides.&#10;&#10;On the broad open plains to the south live the Marmar. Who plant seeds, and raise animals for work and food. They are a peaceful people, desiring only to be left alone. And the strong walls they have built around their village do much to help them maintain their solitude.&#10;&#10;Lastly are the Dermen, who are a tribe of raiders. They know the land well, being so traveled -- getting direction from the patterns in the stars. They go wherever the warmth of the sun and the wealth of nature lead them. And if they cannot find food enough for themselves, they simply take it... from others.&#10;&#10;Welcome to the World of Nomad...&#10;&#10;Nomad is a game based on the life and times of the early tribal societies at the dawning of the Neolithic Age. It is the story of their growth and expansion, their struggles against the elements of a harsh and unforgiving, prehistoric world, full of rivals and predators; every day, a walk through the borderlands between perseverance and&#10;extinction.&#10;&#10;As the chieftain of one of these early tribes, it will be your job to make the decisions that lead your people to prosperity. Will you lead them into the new era, or will&#10;you simply become history?&#10;&#10;";2001;6.0;3.0
2046;Blue Stones;"Wargame set in the world of Zargo (see &quot;Zargo's Lords&quot; and &quot;Zargos&quot;).  The Wizard-Monks defend the magical Blue Stones against three other races.  A classic wargame, albeit with a more tactical scale than Zargo's Lords.&#10;&#10;As usual with International Team, no date to be found anywhere.  My guess would have been 1970s; listed as 1987 by a German Nuernberg game fair review.  Rules in French, Italian and German only!  Funagain claims to have an English translation.

2047;Up the Creek;"An interesting card game where players try to complete three canoes using various cards with parts of the canoes on them.  These include:  Indians or empty sections of the canoe, Prey or Booty (Birds, Skins, Tobacco, Firewater, Teepees, Powder Kegs), Hunters (Bear hunter, Buffalo hunter, Cowboy, Gold prospector, Lumberjack, Soldier), Hunters Prey (Bear, Buffalo, Horse, Gold, Log, Cannon {each prey coming split on two cars}), Medicine Man, and Totem Pole.&#10;&#10;Players strive to finish the game with the most valuable canoes where length of completed canoes, prey and booty, Hunter with Prey and special cards all add to your score. Players can use Indians with a bow or lasso to affect other players canoes.  They can also use completed canoes to attack others with devastating results.&#10;&#10;The original Pelikan edition (Ogallala), in their flat box series, included player mats and allowed for 2 to 4 players. The Waddingtons edition (Up the Creek) also includes player mats for 2 to 4 players.&#10;&#10;";1975;5.75546;1.2391
2048;Starships;"This is really a tile-laying game using cards. An improved version of Up the Creek (a.k.a. Ogallala) transposed to a Science Fiction context.&#10;&#10;In a &quot;space dock&quot; you build up starships. Cards represent prows and poops, and everything in between --missile launchers, laser turrets, shuttles...Special &quot;prizes&quot; appear as pairs of cards; should you be lucky enough to draw both halves and play them side by side, it is worth more. Each of these prizes is worth even more if played in the same starship as a specific accompanying card.&#10;&#10;At any point, you have to choose between closing a starship (and scoring) or building it up some more. In addition, complete starships can attack the other player's starships...&#10;&#10;There is little control in this game, as the players simply draw then place cards - but there's still some reasonable amount of strategy in the placements. The simplicity makes it accessible to children, whilst it remains enjoyable by adults as a light, quick game.&#10;&#10;";1980;6.22826;1.3333
2049;Target;"Target&reg; is a rummy game like nothing you've ever played. One deck of 82 &quot;Playing&quot; cards are numbered 0 though 9 in 4 colorful suits, plus a 5th &quot;wild&quot; suit, and are used for making melds. Another deck contains 28 all-different &quot;Target&quot; cards, each of which describes a meld and a point value, the more difficult melds having a higher point value. Five Target cards are dealt face up for all to see. Players draw and discard as in rummy. When a player lays down the meld shown on one of the Target cards, they win that Target card, and score the points. A new Target card is then dealt to replace it, so the melds change all the time! What's more, players can (and do!) win 2 or more Target cards on a single play by laying down groups of Playing cards which make the melds on 2 or more Target cards. Includes 110 cards and instructions in a colorful metal tin. 2-4 players, ages 8-adult.&#10;&#10;-- from the publisher&#10;&#10;";1997;6.07394;1.3913

2054;Interaction;"&quot;The devious strategy game where each move generates a chain reaction.&quot;&#10;&#10;The board is 9x9 with the corners clipped; the middle row is made out of deeper &quot;pockets&quot;.  Each player controls two cue balls; in addition, there are 10 neutral balls, moved by the cue balls.  The object is to maneuver five neutral balls into the pockets (once there, they are removed for score).&#10;&#10;On your turn, you pick a cue ball and launch it in one of eight possible directions.  Your cue ball may travel any distance in a straight line before hitting a neutral (or another cue ball); at that moment, its momentum is transferred and the ball hit moves the same distance.  Should you hit a row of balls, only the farthest one moves (as in a Newton's Cradle).  All balls bounce off the play area's walls, either straight back when hitting head on, or reflected when hitting at 45 degrees.  Note that a move that doesn't hit any balls is illegal.&#10;&#10;Includes solitaire problems where the object is to find the least number of moves required.&#10;&#10;";1978;5.20833;2.0

2061;A Line in the Sand;"This is a game detailing the Persian Gulf War fought in the early 1990's. Many of the mechanics are similar to that of one of TSR's other wargames (Red Storm Rising) so players of that game can rather easily go to this game.&#10;&#10;Two versions of this game are played. With less than 5 players, the game is a &quot;Basic Game&quot; where military might is what wins the game. Players take sides, usually a combination of Middle Eastern nations plus the US. In the two player version, for instance, it is (quite predictably) the US &amp; Allies vs. Iraq; in the three-player game &quot;Holy War&quot;, it's Israel vs. Iraq (and Yemen and Jordan) vs. Saudi Arabia (and Syria, Libya, and Lebanon), and so on.&#10;&#10;Combat rules are rather straightforward, and wargamers will be familiar with many of the mechanics. Land (w/ infantry, Iraqi National Guard, and tanks), sea, and air units are all utilized. Most units can take a few hits before removed from the board.&#10;&#10;The *real* game, though, is the six-player diplomatic game. The players are now clearly defined: The US (NATO), Iran, Israel, Iraq/Yemen, Moderate Arabs (Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Kuwait, etc.), and Volatile Arabs (Jordan, Libya, etc.) This adds a crucial element of diplomacy and politics, and makes the game much more interesting than the normal wargaming stuff. A &quot;War Fever&quot; and &quot;Jihad&quot; marker change as nations do things--for instance, the first time a US unit is attacked outside of Turkey, War Fever &quot;tripwires&quot; to 10. If Israel attacks a neighbor, Jihad increases by 2. War Fever and Jihad permit certain things to happen--for instance, if War Fever gets too low, the US is restricted in whom they may attack. If Jihad hits either 1 or 10, revolutions may occur--which can switch entire nations to another player!&#10;&#10;Messages can be sent to other players via a diplomatic pouch--you cannot simply pull another player to the side and whisper in their ear. All messages, once read, go into a big pouch, and players can make diplomatic gestures to read some of the messages after they're read.&#10;&#10;Victory occurs, in any case, when you meet objectives, which can vary from player to player. &quot;War Aim&quot; chits are drawn before the game begins, and so players are not quite certain as to exactly what other players are going for. For Instance, Iraq may win if they capture and hold Kuwait for the last three turns; if Jihad has reached 10 at least once and 10 non-Muslim units have been destroyed (by anyone); or by controlling three more oil fields than they started with. It all depends on what they looked for.&#10;&#10;All in all, the Diplomatic game changes the basic game so much that political considerations are as important as military ones.&#10;&#10;A simplified version of the game with the same name appeared in the TSR comic Warhawks #3. Advanced scenarions for the game in the comic appeared in Warhawks #4.&#10;&#10;";1991;5.97215;2.7667
2062;Deal Me In;"Briefly: Scrabble with poker hands.&#10;&#10;Deal Me In is a board game in which players collect tiles (which represent playing cards) and attempt to lay them on the board so as they form poker hands. The higher the hand, the greater the score. The poker hands interlock in the same way as the words on a scrabble board, so it`s possible to score for more than one hand on a turn. When a player scores, he/she takes score chips from the box. the player with the highest scoring number of chips when the cards run out is the winner.&#10;Simple, fast and fairly enjoyable; but very lightweight. An opener/closer.&#10;&#10;The bits: One board, comprising an 11x11 grid. most of the spaces are blank, but some have representations of playing cards on them; these are bonus squares, a la scrabble.&#10;&#10;56 &quot;playing cards&quot;. These are actually good quality cardboard tiles.&#10;&#10;30 No Entry tiles.&#10;&#10;4 playing racks&#10;&#10;Poker chips in various denominations&#10;&#10;Each player starts with chips worth 150 and 7 tiles. These are placed in the playing rack.&#10;the four joker tiles are laid on the Joker squres on the board.&#10;&#10;Players must, on their turn lay at least one card on the board to form a legitimate poker hand, or failing that change one or more tiles at a cost of 10 per tile.&#10;&#10;Tiles laid must extend hands already played, again in the same way as scrabble. &#10;Players do not have to lay five cards at a time. For example, a player could form four of a kind simply by laying three tiles of the same denomination next to a previous tile with that denomination.&#10;&#10;bonuses are scored by laying tiles on the special bonus squares on the board. Again, these squares have representations of playing cards on them and in order to score, you must lay the tile of the same denomination as the bonus square in order to score.&#10;When a five card poker hand has been formed on the board, it can no longer be extended, so a No Entry tile must be laid at either end of the hand to stop any further tiles from being added.&#10;If a hand is played so it covers a Joker tile, this tile is taken up and added to the players` hand.&#10;If a Joker is laid as part of a hand, it may be replaced with the correct tile which it represents on a later turn.&#10;When a player lays a hand down, he/she takes poker chips to the value of the hand. This varies from 10 for a pair, to 1000 for a royal flush.&#10;When the cards run out, scores are totted up and the player with the highest value in chips is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;";1988;6.24706;0.0
2063;The Great Khan Game;"The Great Khan Game includes one 32-page rule book, one 11&quot; x 17&quot; full-color map of the Whamite Isles, 120 die-cut cardboard playing pieces, 162 playing cards, and one plastic storage bag.&#10;&#10;This is a card/strategy board game for 2 or more players.  The game is set in the Whamite Islands.  It is a very fun game, which usually lasts an hour or so depending on the number players and chance.&#10;&#10;The idea of the game is to make as much gold as possible by controlling countries within your own little empire from the dozen or so provinces available.  The game uses a card system with a lot of clever design tricks added on to provide depth.&#10;&#10;The game play within your turn is easy to pick up, but requires much thought to get right. You are dealt six cards initially, which will usually give you weak control of a couple of countries. These can be added to each turn by drawing two free cards or taking the top card from the discard pile. Additionally, you can buy extra cards every turn.  Having checked the cards for events and acted on those immediately, you can make 'melds,' war and political manoeuvres before compulsorily discarding one card.&#10;&#10;The heart of the game is the 'meld.' A meld is simply the act of laying one or more cards from your hand in front of you, thus activating their powers. By having the most powerful political meld on the table (determined by the total number of flags on the melded cards), you control that country until toppled by better politics or combat. Each country normally has a couple of leaders, often with low numbers, and a varying number of higher-numbered followers who might be loyal to any leader card or just one.&#10;&#10;Power can be stolen in two ways: political coups where you lay more flag cards than are currently melded (you take over those cards as well - those willing rally to your cause), or by the time-honoured invasion force.&#10;&#10;Combat is simple enough, but can prove a little fiddly at times. Once battle is joined, a d6 is rolled to see how many rounds the battle will last. Rolling a one when there are two large armies will virtually guarantee a non-result, whereas a six will give both sides a good chance of a win. Swords kill simply on a roll of five or six, castles get to 'fight' in defence, and defending ships must be beaten first.&#10;&#10;The game has an excellent basic structure.  The key to the game is the balance of military, political power, and wealth.  It really works well.  But, as always, there are improvements to be made and rules that can be changed to improve or change the flavor of the game.  But, the reason why the game works well is that there is an excellent structure underlying the few contested rules.&#10;&#10;It's worth adding that a lot of the fun comes from the irreverent humour on the cards--just in case you thought you were playing a serious strategy game.  Names are satirical, silly, or obtuse references to real world people, places or events.  For example, there's a castle named &quot;Ratlarbig&quot; (look at it closely), a character called the &quot;Sorcerer's Apprentice&quot; and a group of soldiers called &quot;The Bloody Buggers&quot;. It's a hoot whether you're winning or losing.&#10;&#10;";1989;6.71649;2.1163

2065;Shogi;"Of Japanese origins, Shogi is played on a 9 by 9 board, and the object is to capture the opponent's king. There are two main differences with Western chess. First, not only pawns but almost every piece can promote if it reaches the opponents three last rows. Second and most distinctive characteristic is that captured pieces become property of the capturing player and during his turn he can &quot;parachute&quot; or &quot;drop&quot; them back to the board instead of performing a normal move. Because of this feature, similar to Bughouse, the game can last longer than a Chess game, the board generally stays fairly crowded and there is no simplification going into the endgame. However, the endgame is typically more rapid with many possibilities for attack and ways to achieve a checkmate, which also makes draws/ties very rare.&#10;&#10;According to &quot;A World of Chess&quot; by Jean-Louis Cazaux &amp; Rick Knowlton (2017, ISBN 978-0-7864-9427-9), Bishop, Rook and Drunk Elephant were introduced to the 9x9 Shogi creating Sho Shogi, the immediate predecessor of Shogi, in the middle of the 15th century. Modern Shogi where created with the introduction of the drop rule and the removal of the Drunk Elephant piece in Sho Shogi. This happened between 1567 and 1587 (earliest recording of modern Shogi). The latter date is based upon a picture in the diary of the samurai Matsudaira Ietada, dated 1587, which shows a game identical to the one of today.&#10;&#10;";1587;7.39135;3.7892

You move wooden blocks with 7 holes around the board looking for 6 letters in your color.  When you come upon one you place a peg with that letter into your block. Anytime you land on a card you turn it over. You can move through cards that are letters that you have in your block.  You can pick up a devil peg voluntarily by landing on the Devil space in the middle of the board or have one forced on you by landing on a devil card.  Devil pegs allow you movement bonuses and allow you to land on an opponent.  You then give the opponent your devil peg and if you receive 2 they fly away taking two letter pegs with them.&#10;&#10;Winner is the person who collects 6 letter pegs while having no Devil pegs.&#10;&#10;";1992;5.37354;2.0

Since its original release, Gulf Strike has shown its ability to simulate the changing character of the Gulf Wars from the Iran-Iraq war to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and its potential aftermath. In fact the original 1983 edition correctly anticipated the type and character of units the United States would send to the region in the event of a crisis. Seven complete scenarios cover the recent history of the region, plus the current Desert Shield operation, and portray the multitude of alliances possible to counter threats arising in numerous quarters. Complete air, land, and sea orders of battle for several dozen nations allow you to fight each conflict to its unpredictable and often startling conclusion.&#10;&#10;";1983;6.69658;4.4048
2077;Hell's Highway: Operation Market Garden;"This game is an operational level simulation of the greatest airborne campaign of World War II. In September of 1944, three Allied airborne divisions dropped up to 60 miles behind German lines in Holland to seize and hold a series of roads and bridges until British ground forces could break through the front lines to link up with the paratroopers- to create an open road to the heart of the Third Reich.  Until now, the tragic yet fascinating story of Market-Garden has not been simulated on a level that allows an appreciation of the entire campaign, without bogging down in endless detail.  In Hell's Highway, players trace the leaden movement of XXX Corps along its jammed highway, drop the gallant paratroopers on the key bridges, and launch the unexpected panzers against the grim Arnhem defenders. Three scenarios and numerous deployment options allow players to explore the battle with historical hindsight, or to experience first-hand the confusion of those bloody days.&#10;&#10;Information from the back of the box:&#10;&#10;Two 20&quot; x 28&quot; maps - connected by their short edges to create a long, thin map area&#10;Two countersheets - 520 half-inch counters&#10;1300 meters/hex&#10;Three (3) turns/day&#10;&#10;Complexity - high.&#10;Solitaire suitability - medium.&#10;Number of players - (1 or) 2 players (also recommended for team play)&#10;Playing time - from 5 hours for a short scenario to 25 hours for a complete campaign&#10;&#10;";1983;7.35122;3.6885
2078;Aegean Strike: Land, Air, and Sea Combat in the Eastern Mediterranean;"Aegean Strike presents a comprehensive and realistic picture of the interplay between ground, air, and naval forces in modern warfare. The highly interactive sequence of play allows players to act and react to the changing battle situation. The integration of combat arms occurs on both the operational and strategic level. Scenarios include a Libyan - Egyptian War, Turkish Missile Crisis, Greco-Turkish War, and, of course, WWIII.&#10;&#10;Gulf Strike is not needed to play Aegean Strike, however, a link-up scenario is included.&#10;&#10;";1986;6.43486;4.2286
2079;NATO: The Next War in Europe;"&quot;NATO: The Next War in Europe&quot; is an operational level simulation of potential NATO/Warsaw Pact conflict in Central Europe.&#10;&#10;The wargame is played on a single mapsheet, depicting the area from Denmark to the Swiss Alps, and from France to Poland.  Each player maneuvers ground forces that include armor, mech, infantry, airborne, airmobile, and marine units in an effort to control - or deny - key geographical objectives.  Designed to be played in one sitting, NATO combines ease of play with a sophisticated integrated  system of unit differentiation, command and supply structure, air power, force projection, chemical warfare, and tactical nuclear warfare.&#10;&#10;";1983;6.72444;3.2143
2080;Central America;"Central America is a comprehensive, dynamic simulation that encapsulates the multiple elements of modern land and air combat.  Conventional and guerrilla warfare are combined in a fluid, interactive game system.  Players choose for themselves the intensity of the game and the level of detail involved.  Four Introductory Scenarios teach the basics of the game.  Five Intermediate Scenarios offer a night's play.  Seven Campaign Scenarios cover the vast potential of war in Central America, from the historical fall of Somoza, to a US invasion of Nicaragua, to World War III.&#10;&#10;";1987;6.08097;4.2326
2081;The Civil War 1861-1865;"This sprawling rendition of the American Civil War tries to fit in everything, from Grant and Lee down to Indian raids in the Western territories. It also includes the most extensive treatment of naval and riverine warfare of any strategic Civil War game. The map covers the theater of the war from the Eastern seaboard to the middle of Texas at 25 miles per hex. An optional second map extends to New Mexico. There are five turns per year, four of two months each and a four-month Winter turn. Each turn consists of an indefinite number of &quot;pulses&quot; and may last a long, long time. Troops are represented by generic Strength Points (about 5,000 men per SP, or one or two ironclads with escorting naval vessels).&#10;&#10;The key concepts in the game are Theaters, Command Points, Pulses and Leaders.&#10;&#10;&#10;     There are three Theaters: East, West and Trans-Mississippi. Players must prioritize them each turn as primary, secondary and tertiary. These designations are made a turn in advance, requiring a modest degree of foresight. Higher priority Theaters receive larger allocations of Command Points and thus will see more activity.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Command Points are needed to perform most of the game's functions, such as moving SP's, consolidating SP's into Armies, constructing fortifications, adding naval SP's, sacking unwanted generals, etc. Players obtain them by dice rolls at the start of each turn. In addition to CP's assigned to individual theaters, they receive an allotment of &quot;discretionary&quot; CP's that can be used in any Theater. The Union also gets Naval CP's. Additional CP's may be generated during a turn, as noted below.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Each turn is divided into an indefinite number of Pulses. To begin a Pulse, each player rolls two dice. The difference between the results is the number of actions each must take in that Pulse (high roller first). Actions may be used to expend Command Points, to muster SP reinforcements or to bring inew or newly promoted Leaders into play. If the dice rolls are equal, either the turn ends immediately or each player receives additional Command Points. The likelihood of an immediate end rises with the number of tied rolls and is a certainty on the fourth tie. If the turn doesn't end in this fashion, it continues until all Command Points have been used and available reinforcements and Leaders entered.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     While Strength Points are abstract, the game includes more than 60 historical Leaders, who enter play at about the time that they rose to prominence in real life. Each Leader has a rank (one to four stars) and ratings for Initiative, Tactical Combat and Army Command. Many begin at lower ranks and can be promoted. Sherman, for instance, has a single star when he appears but can rise to four. Like Presidents Lincoln and Davis in real life, players don't have absolute control over promotions, nor does every Leader perform better at a higher rank. A Leader's rank determines the number of SP's he can command - up to two for a one star, up to six for higher ranks. Assigning as many SP's as permitted to a Leader (preferably a capable one) is economical, since he can move his entire force by expending Command Points equal to his Initiative. (Lower Initiative numbers are better in this game.) Without Leaders, SP's cost one CP each to move, rendering them all but static. Better yet are Armies, which can be as large as 25 SP's and must be commanded by a three or four star Leader. (Each Army has its own maximum size, based on its historical counterpart.)&#10;&#10;&#10;The game has much more: an elaborate combat resolution procedure, somewhat less elaborate supply rules, a naval system that is a game in itself, cavalry, railroads, militia, neutral states and a chrome-laden option to add the Far West map and Theater.&#10;&#10;Players gain Victory Points primarily by capturing major enemy and neutral cities and winning neutral states to their side. The South also gets VP's for successful commerce raiding and for isolating or capturing Washington, D.C. It wins at once if it captures Washington at a moment when it has more VP's than the North. Otherwise, VP's are checked in November 1864 and April 1865, when the game comes to a definitive end.&#10;&#10;For those who lack time or patience for the full war, scenarios are provided with the historical setups as of the start of 1862, 1863 and 1864.&#10;&#10;The Civil War isn't the biggest game ever produced on that dreadful conflict, but it is certainly among the most ambitious in its scope and degree of detail. Includes 520 counters.&#10;&#10;";1983;7.72836;3.7872
2082;Shell Shock!;"Shell Shock! is a two-player game of combat, adventure and heroism in World War II Europe; adapted from the award-winning and incredibly popular Ambush! solitaire game. In each of six missions, one player commands a squad of German infantry while another commands American, British, or Soviet troops. The players determine the composition of their squads - men, weapons, and equipment - and purchase Light and Heavy supports to assist them in the mission - from foxholes and barbed wire to artillery support. Every playing is different as the intensity of the battle, mission objectives, forces and weather change.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;One 22&quot; x 32&quot; Map Display with one 16&quot; x 18 &quot; Map&#10;Four 8&quot; x 16&quot; Maps (B-E)&#10;540 Counters (3 Sheets total)&#10;One Rule Booklet&#10;Two Mission Booklets&#10;Two Player Cards &#10;Two Squad Record Pads&#10;Two Vehicle Displays&#10;120 Playing Cards&#10;- 46 Random Event&#10;- 30 Allied Aid Card&#10;- 30 German Aid Card&#10;- 8 Special Guest&#10;- 6 Crew Vehicle&#10;One Counter Tray&#10;Two ten-sided dice&#10;&#10;";1990;6.39912;3.1786
2083;Checkers;"Abstract strategy game where players move disc-shaped pieces across an 8 by 8 cross-hatched (&quot;checker&quot;) board. &#10;Pieces only move diagonally, and only one space at a time.  If a player can move one of his pieces so that it jumps over an adjacent piece of their opponent and into an empty space, that player captures the opponent's disc.  Jumping moves must be taken when possible, thereby creating a strategy game where players offer up jumps in exchange for setting up the board so that they jump even more pieces on their turn.  A player wins by removing all of his opponent's pieces from the board or by blocking the opponent so that he has no more moves.&#10;This game, also known as Draughts, is part of the Checkers family.&#10;&#10;The Official Checker Board to be used in tournaments and official matches of associations like international WCDF, ACF, and APCA usually shall be colored of green and off-white (buff). Board squares shall be not less than 2 inches nor more than 2&frac12; inches wide.

2084;Sherlock Holmes: The Game of the Great Detective;"One player acts as Sherlock Holmes for the round. They select a choice in each of five clue categories (age &amp; sex, height &amp; weight, color of hair, access, and weapon) and hides his choices from the other players. The other players move around the board trying to decipher which clues the Holmes player chose.&#10;&#10;When one player decides they have enough information to go to 221B Baker St., they move there and all of the non-Holmes players make their best guesses in all five categories. Players score 20 points for a correct guess. The player who made it to 221B Baker St. earns a 100-point bonus if they get all five categories correct. Holmes scores 10 points for each incorrect guess made by any player.&#10;&#10;After scoring, the next player becomes Holmes and another round is played. This continues until each player has been Holmes once. Scores for all of the rounds are added up to determine the winner.&#10;&#10;";1956;5.85714;1.0
2086;Elfer raus!;"Players attempt to empty their hands by playing off of the starting card in a grid pattern on the table. The number and color of a card determine whether or where a card may be placed, and players may play multiple cards per round or hold back any number of cards as a tactical decision. The game starts with the 11 red on the table, thus the title Eleven Starts!&#10;&#10;";1925;5.22864;1.1
2087;Magic Dance;"A memory and strategy game also published by F.X. Schmid under the title Dance of the Witches, this is essentially Pachisi but so that the playing pieces' identities are hidden, and after a while the game gets pretty chaotic with each player trying desperately to remember which of the witches belong to them and not help opponents or hinder themselves by mistake - it's even possible to drive opposing pieces home by driving them into your own base by mistake, in which case they will instantly teleport to the correct one. Also, pieces are not captured - probably because this would mean revealing their identity - but simply jumped back 7 spaces on the track and if that space is occupied, they're jumped back another 7, and so on. It is possible to make any one piece's identity public for a moment though, by rolling a 6, but that 6 cannot then be used for movement also.&#10;&#10;Like Sagaland/Enchanted Forest - which the playing pieces will bring to memory - this is more of a family game than simply a children's game.&#10;&#10;";1988;5.76983;1.4561
2088;Coup;"Players attempt to acquire shares in the most valuable companies. Companies work to build valuable blocks of adjacent properties and see that they are booked full of tourists. Players maneuver to boost the value of companies in which they own stock.&#10;&#10;The gaming board consists of 6 columns of different colors with fields numbered from 1-20, so 120 fields. Then there are wooden bits with the corresponding colors and numbers to the columns, and chips of the different colors of the columns. Every player secretly draws the wooden bits and tries to make series of numbers in the different columns. The longer the series, the more points it will generate at the end. At each players turn, beside putting the wooden bits, they can buy the colored chips. The more colored chips of the column with the longest series you have the better are your chances of winning. Players can also change unwanted wooden bits with new ones during their turn.&#10;&#10;";1975;6.28077;1.8235

2090;Stalingrad Pocket: The Wehrmacht's Greatest Disaster;"Stalingrad Pocket: The Wehrmacht's Greatest Disaster - The German Wehrmacht stands at the pinnacle of its last season of blitzkrieg. After battling for the capture of Stalingrad through most of the Autumn, the German army holds the bulk of the city. Holding the extended flanks of the German advance are Axis allied troops of dubious quality. Opposing those flanks are the shock troops of the 1942 Soviet winter counteroffensive. The latter are poised to initiate the encircling movement which will generate the Stalingrad Pocket and later the greatest single disaster to befall the German army during World War II.&#10;&#10;Stalingrad Pocket is the first Standard Combat Series (SCS) game by The Gamers and covers the Soviet counteroffensive Operation Uranus and the German attempts to hold its pincers apart. It  the fighting in November and December 1942. Soviet play requires the optimum use of a ponderous and fragile weapon&mdash;the Red Army of '42. German play requires saber-like use of mobile forces, the concentration and maintenance of reserves, and lightning hit and run attacks designed to derail the Soviet military machine.&#10;&#10;The Standard Combat Series is a new gaming series that will take its place along side the others in The Gamers (and later Multi-Man Publishing) line of products. It is designed to off-set the more complex treatments of our other series. Experienced players will feel comfortable with the system as soon as they read the rules.

2092;Elfengold;"Note: that this game is NOT to be confused with the Elfengold expansion set of the same name (also designed by Alan Moon).&#10;&#10;Once upon a time in the Land of the White Winds...&#10;...there was an old and good-natured troll who owned a prosperous mine. The mine was so prosperous, in fact, that the troll had accumulated enough wealth to retire after years of hard work.&#10;Once a year, the elves who live in the forests near the mine celebrate their Great Wood Fair. One of the highlights of each Fair is the mining competition. The troll, who enjoys the Fair just as much as the elves, gladly opens up the mine to let the elves dig for gold. Only the fastest and luckiest elf is allowed to keep his gold though, so while the competition is friendly, it is also very challenging. No one seems to care that the elves try to hinder each other by hiding stones where they think their fellow competitors will dig. In the end, it is the most clever elf who will win and stake a claim to his gold.&#10;&#10;This is an simple bluffing game from the White Wind stable. Players spend money to buy shovels &amp; pickaxes to dig for gold. They then enter the mine, and start to dig. But wait!! players also get to place broken shovel and decoy counters on the board as well. A broken shovel means no gold, and you lose the implement you were digging with. All decoys (or no counters) means you get the gold value on the board space you're digging from. The question is - to dig or not to dig??&#10;&#10;The winner is the first to 50 gold, or the highest gold when someone with 50 gold gets out of the mine.&#10;&#10;";1991;5.98073;2.2

It is a popular gambling game, but wagering real stakes is by no means necessary to have fun playing.&#10;&#10;The tiles consist of three suits numbering 1-9 (Dots, Numbers or Characters, and Bamboo, the &quot;Ace&quot; of which almost always looks like a bird), three different dragons (Red, Green, and White [white is unusual in that it may look like a silvery dragon, or like a picture frame, or blank - think &quot;White dragon in a snowstorm&quot;), and the four winds (east, south, west, and north).  There are four copies of each tile.  This totals to 136 tiles. In addition, special Flower, Season, and Joker (American version) tiles may also be used.&#10;&#10;Four players take turns drawing from a stock (the wall), or from the other players' discards, in an attempt to form sets of numeric sequences (e.g., 5-6-7 of the same suit, which can only be drawn from the player at one's left, by calling &quot;Chow&quot;), triplets and quadruplets (which can be drawn from the discards out-of-turn by calling &quot;Pung&quot;), pairs, and other patterns. &quot;Pung&quot; takes precedence over &quot;Chow&quot;, and &quot;Mah Jongg&quot; takes precedence over all (and is the only situation one may draw &quot;Chow&quot; out-of-turn.) What happens if a single discard would give two (or more!) players &quot;Mah Jongg&quot;? Precedence goes to the player who would play next in normal sequence.&#10;&#10;Originating in China in the mid-19th century, it was introduced to the U.S. in the 1920s.  It is now played in different forms throughout Asia, Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand.

Players take turns adding and possibly moving blocks on a board, each turn adding to one of six towers, to a maximum or four blocks per tower.

2098;Heresy;"If you know how to play Magic, you are half way there in this blatant Magic clone. What makes this game different is there are two areas to fight/control and the artwork on the cards.&#10;&#10;The story, Heaven has fallen and the Angels trapped on Earth are trying to use the Matrix (internet) to open a gateway into Heaven.&#10;&#10;There are six basic types of cards.&#10;&#10;Locations (lands) that open (tap) to provide aura (mana) or store tau (victory points.) There are 8 different convictions (colors) so from a starter it will still be near impossible to build a deck.&#10;&#10;Characters (creatures) represent the fallen hosts and heathen groups that can be called. These can battle in the Wilds (real world) or plug in and leave their body and fight in the Matrix. While there, if they die they're ripped back into their body.&#10;&#10;Alephs (artifacts) are powerful talismans that attach to characters or locations.&#10;&#10;Enhancements (enchantments) attach to other cards for positive or negative affects.&#10;&#10;Celestial Powers (sorceries) can be played on your turn only and are discarded immediately.&#10;&#10;Miracles (instants) are instant effects that can be played anytime.&#10;&#10;To win the game you need to play cards in the Matrix that can store tau and protect them. Each card can only hold so much, so you will need to call more then one. You will need to store enough tau (5 to 21 depending on the number of players and desired game length) to open a gateway into heaven.&#10;&#10;The game is a bit more complicated than Magic but with fewer cards available not as rich. There is also a social voting element similar to V:tES/Jyhad.  Special mention must be made of the cards. The cards are about an inch longer than most ccgs, with most of the extra room taken up by the stunning artwork.

They know you've found Project KGB, the secret undercover spy training camp!&#10;&#10;Game 2 of 2 in a series called &quot;Spy Training Games&quot; and issued in 1973 by House of Games Corporation Limited (Bramalea, Ontario, Canada)&#10;&#10;Game 1 is &quot;Project CIA: The Secret Formula&quot;.&#10;Game 2 is &quot;Project KGB: The Double Agent&quot;.&#10;&#10;In Game 2, you're either an agent trying to identify the double agent, or you're the latter, sabotaging the training camp.

2105;Sopwith;"A simple, fast-playing and very enjoyable game of World War I aerial dogfighting.&#10;&#10;The board is hexagonal, and up to 6 players may play at once.  You have your own airstrip, to which you can return for repairs and ammunition reload; however, their approach is severely constrained, leaving you vulnerable to other players awaiting to pounce on you.  Each player simultaneously selects which way he'll fly, and later on the bullets rip through the air.  Clouds complicate maneuvers somewhat.&#10;&#10;Similar to Blue Max but a lot simpler.&#10;&#10;The game was originally published by Gametime Games. A second edition was published (apparently by the designer) under the company name &quot;Gamer.&quot;&#10;&#10;";1978;6.72177;1.75

This is a two player Hex and Counter game where one player plays the Vilani Empire that is slowly expanding to take over the entire galaxy.  Naturally, the Vilani Empire has recently discovered the Terran Empire (Player 2) and conflicts arise for control of Earth and her surrounding star systems.

In turn, players roll a colored die, then offer at least one face-down money card to the player indicated by the roll. That player may either accept the offer or challenge it. After challenging the offer, the player rolls a numbered die. If the number is greater than the amount of money offered, the offering player must add at least one face-down card to the mix and begin the process anew. If the die roll is equal to the money, the offer must be accepted. If the roll is less than the offer, the offering player keeps his money and the challenging player must pay the offering player the amount offered.

2114;Duck, Duck, Bruce;"A simple push-your-luck card game with mechanics similar to Can't Stop. Players reveal cards from the draw pile one at a time, and may stop at any point and collect the cards into their score pile. However, if two fish of the same type are revealed, the player loses those cards and all cards in between, as well as forfeiting his turn. An octopus card when revealed also will end the turn and cost the player the other cards turned up on that turn, but allows the player to attempt to steal cards from another player's score pile. Only the biggest fish of a type in a player's pile count for scoring purposes.

Each player has a parking meter which they can add time to by playing Feed the Meter cards.  They then can play errand or Point cards, like visit the health club or renew your driver's license.&#10;&#10;Special cards allow you to affect the play of others and the second chance cards are a random good or bad effect.&#10;&#10;The first player to score 200 or more points is the winner.&#10;&#10;This game has a Mille Bourne type feel to it.&#10;&#10;";1988;5.2668;1.1071

There is room for two identical tiles on each space. Each space has a different score value but the tiles placed only score when they are joined by neighbouring tiles.

2119;221B Baker St.: Sherlock Holmes & the Time Machine;"This is the newest edition of the 221B Baker St. game, and the gameplay is nearly identical to the original. Twenty &quot;all-new, all-true&quot; mysteries of the 20th century include:&#10;&#10;     The JFK assassination in &quot;The Camelot Conspiracy, Pt. I and II&quot;&#10;     Jimmy Hoffa's disappearance in &quot;The Vanishing Teamster&quot;&#10;     Elvis's death in &quot;The King's Early Exit&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;221B Baker Street is the London address of the world's most celebrated fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes, and his dedicated companion, Dr. Watson. However, instead of staying in London, in this version players use H. G. Wells' Time Machine to travel to the future, attempting to solve infamous cases from the 20th Century.&#10;&#10;Each player assumes the role of Holmes and matches wits with the other players to determine who possesses the most skillful powers of deduction. The game includes 20 cases based on famous crimes and criminals of the 20th Century, including the Zodiac Killer, Sacco and Vanzetti, the Lindbergh Kidnapping, and &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot;. Each case is represented by a card that features a crime told in story form, a selection of probable suspects and a list of locations involved in that crime.&#10;&#10;The board represents the various cities the crimes occurred in, with eighteen generic locations to find clues (Pharmacy, Hotel, Airport, Supermarket, Tavern, Harbor, FBI, etc.). Players must collect clues from different locations, noting them down on their checklists as they attempt to find the answers to the questions listed on the case card. Movement is via die roll.&#10;&#10;Naturally, the crime scene will often contain vital clues, and a prudent detective always checks with the neighbors. Still, you can learn something important almost anywhere in town. The first player to figure out the correct answers to a particular mystery or crime, return to the Time Machine and announce the solution, is the winner.&#10;&#10;There are two versions of this edition: Standard and Deluxe. The Standard version uses regular movers, while the Deluxe version includes six &quot;collectible&quot; pewter playing pieces: Deerstalker Cap, Time Machine, Dark Lantern, Magnifying Glass, Violin, Pipe.&#10;&#10;";1996;5.80477;2.0
2120;Looney Tunes Trading Card Game;"A very simple game which, unusual for a collectible card game, has only three types of cards. Scenes, which are Loony Tune episodes, have a value and color. Actors, which are characters from various cartoons, each also have a value and color. Special effects are the monkey wrenches that may be thrown into the mix for more randomness.&#10;&#10;Four scenes are laid out and replenished when depleted. The object is to play Actors to the scenes to try to steal them. The active player plays actors and/or special effects to a scene then the inactive player does the same. After both have played the scene is removed and scored.&#10;&#10;To win the scene you must have the best actors. The hierarchy for scoring is...&#10;&#10;1. The highest value of same color actors not exceeding the scene value.&#10;&#10;2. The highest value of wrong colored actors not exceeding the scene value.&#10;&#10;3. The highest value actors exceeding the scene value. These actors are overacting.&#10;&#10;...with the active player winning ties.&#10;&#10;The game is good for children because of its simplicity but will not keep the interest of veteran game players.

2121;The Sword and the Stars;"Sword and the Stars sets the stage for interstellar conflict between vying empires on such a scale (the map depicts about 1/4 of a spiral galaxy) that individual ships and even fleets become insignificant. You pay for and resolve entire interstellar campaigns with cards representing massive scale investment of manpower and resources over 4 Earth years of operations, each player round representing the passage of 20 years. Players direct the fate of interstellar empires through expansion or consolidation by means of conquests, raids, governing, building planetary defenses, commerce, and diplomacy.&#10;&#10;The game was derived from two existing popular SPI titles. While adding many subtle changes in its own right, it combines the highly successful system used in Empires of the Middle Ages with the graphic layout used for Freedom in the Galaxy. Technology and economics are abstracted, but both play a large role in just about every aspect of the game. Stargates allow players to conduct interstellar operations against any star system, free of range constraints. This means that in an interstellar war, nowhere is safe from your enemies.&#10;&#10;Includes a mechanism for a sort of Galactic Security Council, where players can scheme all sorts of mischief against each other.&#10;&#10;Ten scenarios (including the &quot;Galactic Cycle&quot; campaign game) are supplied. A &quot;short&quot; game will depict a period lasting about 200 years, while for the long &quot;grand campaign&quot; scenario it is recommended to play &quot;at least&quot; 1000 years. The Sword and the Stars is more compact than Empires. Includes 400 counters, 56 year cards, a 17 x 22&quot; map depicting a total of 42 star systems. Maximum 5 players (3-4 recommended).&#10;&#10;Historical Note:&#10;Writing about SPI's Empires of the Middle Ages (q.v.), editor Kula included a sidebar quote from Redmond Simonsen to the effect that &quot;a good number of people...would really enjoy the game if they'd just imagine that it's a science fictional or fantastic continent instead of Europe&quot;. Well, in 1981, the year after Empires of the Middle Ages was released, SPI produced another game using the same system and the missing science fiction premise, and The Sword and the Stars was born.&#10;&#10;";1981;6.32792;3.0526
2122;Vampire: The Eternal Struggle;"Vampire: the Eternal Struggle (or VTES for short) is a multi-player collectable card game based on the award-winning Vampire: the Masquerade role playing game in which players take on the role of ancient vampires known as a Methuselahs. Considered mere legend by many, Methuselahs rule everything from the shadows, engaging in a eons-long Machiavellian conflict that encompasses political, social, and even physical warfare. The struggle is won or lost based on the actions taken by your minions &ndash; younger vampires who unknowingly do your bidding. In this way, the game can allow for deep and immersive storytelling as your minions purchase equipment, hire retainers, even suggest legislative changes to vampiric society, all in the service of your dark plots.&#10;&#10;VTES was the second card game designed by Richard Garfield (designer of Magic the Gathering, Netrunner, and other games). It was designed to avoid some of the flaws that Garfield found in Magic: VTES does not require you to include resource or mana cards in your deck, and cards are instantly replaced when played, meaning that card draw isn&rsquo;t as important as knowing when to discard a card to sculpt a better hand. It also has a gameplay experience more in keeping with a boardgame than a traditional card game &ndash; VTES is usually played by 4 or 5 players and games can last up to 2 hours.&#10;&#10;Unlike most multi-player games, players in VTES do not engage in a free-for-all. Each player directs their attacks to the player on their left (their &ldquo;prey&rdquo;) and defends against the player on their right (their &ldquo;predator&rdquo;). You gain victory points by eliminating or &ldquo;ousting&rdquo; your prey from the game, in which case the next player to the left becomes your new prey. The player with the most victory points at the end of the game wins (even if they have been ousted!). This arrangement makes the game a very social one &ndash; you and the player two seats to the left and right have common enemies. But if you help these allies too much, you may find that you&rsquo;ve made one of them too strong, and when they suddenly become your new predator, your help has transformed that ally into a deadly threat.&#10;&#10;VTES is also a resource management game. Each player begins with 30 points of influence called &ldquo;pool&rdquo; that Methuselahs hold dearer than unlife itself. If you run out of pool, you are ousted from the game. But this pool is also the way that you sway vampires to your cause. Each turn you have the opportunity to spend your pool to seduce a vampire. Weak fledgling vampire are easily swayed, but the older more powerful ones require convincing, which may require multiple turns to accomplish. Once a vampire is converted to your side, all the pool you spent on them becomes blood possessed by this vampire, which can be spent to play cards that allow them to activate their unique vampiric powers. Each minion must manage their blood and you must manage your pool &ndash; spending more provides you with additional minions, but brings you one step closer to being ousted. Under- or over- investing in your minions may well cost you the game.&#10;&#10;Vampire: The Eternal Struggle has risen once again from torpor! White Wolf has granted Black Chantry Productions license to print new cards! Details are still forthcoming as to what to expect. Go to http://www.blackchantry.com for the latest details.

2123;Shadowrun: The Trading Card Game;"This game takes fantasy with magic, elves, dwarves, orcs, trolls etc., and puts them in a cyberpunk world 60 years in the future.&#10;&#10;There are 7 types of cards...&#10;&#10;&#10;    Runners - You collect groups of these characters and use them to make runs on objectives.  Some of these can  support the group through computers while staying safe at home.  These cards have symbols on them that represent their abilities and these are use to bypass threats without actually having to face them.&#10;    Objectives - These are what you are making runs on.  They are worth reputation points and usually have a task that you must best or a number of symbols that you have to match with the symbols on your runners.&#10;    Challenge - You assign these to the objectives as additional hurdles that you have to get by before you can tackle the objective.  Usually you can overcome them with the right symbols but if not they can represent nasty things you will have to fight or things that will just hurt you.&#10;    Gear - This is stuff that you assign to runners to help them make runs.  Some gear requires you to have a runner with a matching symbol.&#10;    Locations - These represent places that you control and can help you in various ways.&#10;    Contacts - These represent people that will help you. &#10;    Specials - These are instants that you play to affect the current situation.&#10;&#10;&#10;Everything is driven by money which is hard to come by.  It costs money to acquire almost every card and a lot of cards require money spent just to keep them in play or every time you use them.&#10;&#10;";1997;6.46493;2.7273
2124;Total Depth;"Subtitled &quot;An Oil Man's Game&quot;, this game for would-be oil well operators Ages 12 and up was produced in Dallas, Texas.&#10;&#10;As in Monopoly, players roll dice to move around the outside board edge. Other similarities include an extra turn when doubles are rolled, two decks of cards (&quot;Production&quot; and &quot;Exploration&quot;), income tax, income upon passing the start space and even incorporation of the unofficial &quot;Free Parking&quot; variant, here called the Slush Fund.&#10;&#10;Different is an interior board path and an elevated 6x6 drilling board. Landing on an outer board space usually offers the chance to lease a plot on the drilling board if not already leased. Travel on the interior board, possible only by landing exactly on its entrance or possession of a plastic permit token (obtained by landing on other spaces), permits drilling once one has a drilling company. This is very much a costly hit-and-miss affair, especially when drilling without any other proven oil fields nearby.&#10;&#10;If the player does not go bankrupt, eventually his plots should be populated with a lot of black plastic pegs indicating gushers rather than the yellow ones which signify dry holes. Then each time a player passes the start, he is paid based on the number of barrels he is pumping.&#10;&#10;Unlike Monopoly, the idea is not to drive others into bankruptcy, but to be the first to reach one million dollars. While there is a good atmosphere of real drilling situations, there is also much chaos in the dice, cards and spinner.&#10;&#10;";1984;6.0625;3.0
2125;Amazons;"The game is played on a square grid, usually 10 by 10.  Each player starts with four amazons (which move as chess queens, but do not capture) placed in predetermined locations on their side of the board.  On a player turn, he moves one amazon and then fires an arrow from the arrival position. Firing an arrow consists in placing a new arrow piece on the board; also the arrow moves like a queen from the position it is fired. The landed arrow doesn't move anymore and creates a permanent block on the board. Arrows can not be passed through by either amazons or other arrows.  The first player who can not make a legal move (move and then shoot) loses the game.&#10;&#10;";1992;7.20308;2.8125
2127;Overpower;"This defunct CCG is primarily based on characters from Marvel comics, with DC and Image comics represented in later expansions.&#10;&#10;Each player has a team of 4 characters, each rated in 3 or 4 skill types. At the beginning of each hand, each player makes a wager of some of their 7 mission cards based on how confident they are that they can &quot;win&quot; the hand by causing the most damage. Players then take turns playing a card from their hand or cards set aside from previous hands. Cards include Power cards (basic attack or defense in a skill type), Universe cards (e.g., a city bus, which adds value to a Strength attack), Special cards (usually character specific with varying effects), and more in later expansions. At the end of each hand, the damage from that hand is totaled; the player who caused the most &quot;completes&quot; their wagered missions, while the other player is &quot;defeated&quot; with those missions. Players may concede a hand instead of playing a card, losing their missions but avoiding further damage&#10;&#10;A player wins when they have knocked out all 4 opposing characters, &quot;completed&quot; all of their missions, or their opponent is &quot;defeated&quot; in all missions. (There is also a basic game option without the use of missions or conceding, in which the sole victory condition is knocking out the opposing team.)&#10;&#10;";1995;5.73537;1.8684
2128;Warlords;"This CCG actually plays like the computer game with the same name. You start with your castle and a hero and from there you play armies, castles and ruins. The armies go forth upon the play of march cards and try to take over other castles. Castles give you gold to spend. Heroes can also search ruins for gold or cool stuff.&#10;&#10;Different scenarios have different winning conditions such as most gold or control of over half the castles.&#10;&#10;Artwork is OK and it is fairly easy to collect as it can be found fairly cheap.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     CCG Workshop (no longer available)&#10;&#10;&#10;Regarding the publisher, Strategic Studies Group is an Australian company that is in no way connected to the other SSG (who published wargames such as Alaric).

2130;Young Jedi: Collectible Card Game;"&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;        GAME SYSTEM&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         This entry is to allow for discussion/rating of the game system as a whole. It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;This is a very simple CCG based on the movie Star Wars: Episode I.&#10;&#10;First, after shuffling, you see who goes first (usually drawing &quot;destiny&quot;) and then draw 6 cards from your reserve deck.  The player who goes first usually chose the planet to battle at first.  And, from these 6 cards, you then deploy up to 6 &quot;counters&quot; worth of cards from your hand.  These can be Locations (if you are on the same planet), weapons and characters.  There were also &quot;effect&quot; cards that could be deployed to the table to boost up your characters, power, equipment and # of counters per turn.&#10;&#10;Phase two is battling for the planet you are currently on.  You lay any battle cards in your hand down and pick up your deployed character and weapon cards.  These are arranged in the order of &quot;battle card, weapon card, character card.&quot;  With the cards in order from last (first character you want to battle with) to first (last character to be battled), you place them face down in a stack and you both turn over cards until you get to a character (in the case of weapons and battle cards).  Cards turned over before the character are attached to the character (weapons and such) if the character can use them.  If the character can not use them, then they are discarded.  If you have weapons, you total up the number of &quot;power dots&quot; (red dots) and draw destiny.  That is the top card of your reserve deck.  You then look at the small number on the &quot;die&quot; in the upper right hand corner of the card.  You add this power to the character.  Whichever character has more power wins and the loser discards his character and attached cards.  Damage is listed on the card that lost.  The loser then discards that many cards off the top of his or her deck.  Both players then turn over their cards in the fight deck for the next characters to fight, etc. If the attacker ends up with more characters then the defender then the defender discards 1 card for each.  The cards that survived the battle remain at the planet for the next round.&#10;&#10;The final phase is called even up.  Pick up your original hand and you may discard it before drawing back up to 6 cards then go back to phase one again.  If you have more than 6 cards in your hand, you have to discard down to 6.  If you have less than, and you wish to keep them, you then draw to equal 6.  If you are not satisfied with your hand, you can discard the whole thing and draw 6 fresh cards.&#10;&#10;If after a battle you are the only one with characters left on a planet you have won it and you move to the next planet which is chosen by the winner of the planet.  You can also &quot;surrender&quot; the planet.&#10;&#10;You win by controlling 2 of the 3 planets or by running your opponent out of cards.&#10;&#10;There are a lot of other little things involved but that is basically how the game goes.  The artwork on the cards is up to Deciphers usual very high standards.&#10;&#10;";1999;4.99988;1.6364
2131;Wildstorms;"Wildstorms is a CCG based on Image Comics characters.&#10;&#10;A battlesite card is fought over by the characters.  Winning the battlesite wins the game.

2132;Guardians;"This CCG plays more like a board game than a card game.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a Guardian, a very powerful creature with special abilities.  In front of the Guardian you place a set of 3 stronghold cards.  These are locations that give you bonuses.  In front of these are 3 empty spaces that terrain cards will be placed.  These will match up to the other players 3 empty spaces thus creating the board.&#10;&#10;Onto your stronghold you can place creatures under a shield to keep them hidden.  Only creatures under a shield can move and they can move up to 2 spaces with some restrictions.  There is a limit to what can be put under the shields so you can not make your army too big.&#10;&#10;When two armies met they battle.  Combat is fairly detailed.  Both players pick up their cards from under the shields to make a combat hand.  Each player secretly chooses one creature and they are placed down on the table.  The stronger then covers the weaker.  This is repeated for each creature until only one player has creatures left in his hand.  He can then assign these creatures to help any of the previous creatures placed.  There are many modifiers involved and each stack of creatures must be checked for a winner.  All losers are discarded.  After determining each battle the total strength of each army is checked.  The weaker army must then retreat or the attacker in case of a tie.&#10;&#10;To win you must either control all six of the lands between the strongholds, destroy 5 of the opponents shields or destroy the opposing Guardian.&#10;&#10;After the first release, a revised edition was published ('Guardians Revised Edition'). The game has three expansions, namely&#10;&#10;    Dagger Isle&#10;    Drifter's Nexus&#10;    Necropolis Park&#10;&#10;&#10;";1995;6.43532;2.6667
2133;Rage;"Publisher Blurb&#10;These are the last days. Gaia is dying. The Apocalypse is here.&#10;&#10;Will you fall defending her or die a cowards death? Will your pack live in legend as the ones who saved the world, or those who betrayed it?&#10;&#10;Is today a good day to die?&#10;&#10;Take control of a pack of Garou, savage werewolves, as they battle the forces of the Wyrm in defense of Mother Earth, Gaia.&#10;&#10;Call upon ancient spirit pacts, mystical abilities, and the tools of the modern world to destroy the forces of corruption that threaton to plunge the world into eternal darkness and decay.&#10;&#10;But not every Garou agrees how best to save Gaia. Is it best done through force? Through renewing the traditions and spirit pacts of old? Through mystical means? Or should the Garou just adapt to the new age and help Gaia change to fit into the new world?&#10;&#10;Or sell out and play a pack of Wyrm creatures hell bent on seeing that the Wyrm is the final victor in the coming Apocalypse.&#10;&#10;But not even the forces of the Wyrm can agree on their methods. Should they concentrate on corrupting humans and Garou to do the Wyrm's bidding? Should they fight the Garou claw to claw? Or should they win the war by destroying every last thing the Garou love and cherish?&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;Each player has two decks. One deck is his &quot;Sept&quot; hand.  This is composed of allies, equipment, fetishes, events, victims, gifts, quests, and several other card types depending on which expansions you are using.  The other deck is a combat deck showing special maneuvers which are used when two characters are engaged in combat.&#10;&#10;Play begins with each player laying out his pack (collection of Character cards).  These are all the characters the player will have for that game.  The game ends when one pack achieves the same number of Renown as they had starting Renown.  Typically, players start with a 20 Renown pack (each character has a Renown) and thus the game ends when someone has 20 renown in their victory pile.&#10;&#10;Play is simultaneous, with all players taking actions at the same time - conflicts are generally resolved based on the renown of the character taking an action; well known characters go first.  The game is split into several phases:&#10;Redraw - draw your Sept hand back to 5 cards&#10;Regeneration - heal characters that have been hurt&#10;Resource - play most cards like gifts, equipment etc.&#10;Umbra - play special umbra cards and actions&#10;Moot - play special cards which may change rules. These must be voted on by all players.&#10;Combat - resolve any fights.&#10;&#10;Each round a player designates one of his characters as Alpha.  The Alpha becomes the primary actor for that round.  During the combat round, Alphas may:&#10;1) Attack another Alpha&#10;2) Attack a victim&#10;3) Attack an enemy&#10;4) Challenge an ally or a non-Alpha character&#10;5) Attack a territory&#10;6) Do nothing.&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved using a separate deck which allows special maneuvers.&#10;&#10;Renown (victory points) are earned by defeating rival characters and enemies. Some packs may reverse the rules and gain victory by defeating victims.  Renown can also be earned from moots and quests.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.12007;2.3864
2134;Rage (Second Edition);"In 1998 Rage underwent a major revision that cleaned up a lot of problems with the previous version by White Wolf Studios. Now instead of a free for all the game requires you to watch your resources. Although the backs of the cards have stayed the same the cards now have a lot more info on them and with new rules the original cards are totally incompatible. This is still a game of ferocious werewolf vs. werewolf combat but the game has been changed greatly.&#10;&#10;This version is commonly referred to as RALV, Snake Eyes, or Rage: Tribal War to distinguish it from the first version.&#10;&#10;If you have cards and are unsure which version they belong to, there's an easy way to tell.  RALV character cards all have a paw print somewhere on the card frame (95% are on the bottom).  Combat cards have a blood spot in the upper left corner with a number in them.  Sept cards list the card type in the upper right corner.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.93597;2.1429
2135;On the Edge;"On the Edge is a card game based on the Over the Edge RPG setting. It was one of the earliest to jump on the Magic/collectible bandwagon.  To their credit they did create a game that was very unlike Magic in play and flavor. The card types are:&#10;&#10;Characters - These are your soldiers and they are laid out in a grid that is a maximum of three deep.  You can only attack or defend with the first untapped character in each row (with exceptions of course).  Some characters also generate Pull points.  These are used like money to bring cards in play or to generate influence which is needed to win so they of course must be protected.&#10;&#10;Resources - These generate Pull for bringing cards into play.  Pull generated from resources can not be used to generate influence.&#10;&#10;Whammy - These are instants that you can play anytime.&#10;&#10;Gear - These are items you can assign to characters.&#10;&#10;Condition - These are assigned to characters and can have positive or negative affects.&#10;&#10;Environmental - These cards affect the game as a whole.&#10;&#10;Secrets - These usually affect cards from specific conspiracies.&#10;&#10;The game is generally played by putting your big hitters in your front row, your big defenders in your second row and your pull generators in your last row.  First player to generate a predetermined amount of influence wins.&#10;&#10;The art on the cards is very strange and different people either love or despise.&#10;&#10;";1994;6.29387;2.3913
2136;Pachisi;"Pachisi, the national game of India, dates back to 4 AD and remains popular today.  Each player has a set of pawns that start in his or her corner of the board.  The goal is to move the pawns around the board to the &quot;home&quot; section.  Movement is controlled by dice.  All players move around the same board, so they may capture each others pawns.  Captured pawns are returned to their player's corner and must start their journey over.  The winner is the first player to move all pawns &quot;home&quot;.&#10;&#10;Parcheesi is the westernized version.&#10;&#10;The usual game is for 2-4 players.  Jumbo's version handles up to 6. There is also a Schmidt-Spiele edition with a double-sided board. One side for 4 players, the other for 6. Juegos de la Antig&uuml;edad Parchis boards are up to 8 players.&#10;&#10;'Wa-hoo' (or 'Wahoo') is a homegrown variant of the game, popular in Texas and surrounding states since the early 1900s, which features different rules and team play.&#10;&#10;Another homegrown variant is to prohibit players to capture each others pawns. But this overprotective variant is not recommended!&#10;&#10;";400;4.51718;1.1785
2137;Quest for the Grail;"King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table make their way to the CCG world via this game.  The object of the game is to go on quests to reap rewards or valor. With 12 valor you can make a quest for the grail to win the game.&#10;&#10;You play with two decks.  The quest deck has quests that your or your opponents can undertake.&#10;&#10;Your court deck has your warriors (who go on the quests), domains (which supply power to pay the upkeep on cards in play), companions (who are assigned to a warrior to help him), events (which can be played anytime and have different durations), spells (which can only be cast by a warrior or companion who is an enchanter), combat (which are used in combat to affect your abilities) and rewards (which can be assigned to a warrior in lieu of valor upon completion of a quest).&#10;&#10;To go on the quest for the grail a warrior must have 12 or more valor.  He then completes 3 quests from the quest deck in a row while maintaining 12 or more valor.&#10;&#10;Also credited as a designer is Richard Trainham.

2138;Crisis: Sinai 1973;"On October 6, 1973, Egyptian forces, lavishly equipped with the latest Soviet weaponry, launched a surprise attack in overwhelming strength against the 436 Israeli infantrymen and 200 tanks that were guarding the Suez Canal.  The Egyptian onslaught was spearheaded by seven divisions and over a thousand tanks - with another three divisions and 300 tanks in reserve around Cairo.  Despite these long odds, the Israelis believed they would be able to repel the assault with relative ease.&#10;&#10;Within 72 hours, the assumptions that formed the foundation of the Israeli strategy - the defensive value of the Suez Canal, the absolute superiority of Israeli troops, and the decisive role of the Israeli Air Force - were proven to be shockingly, undeniably mistaken.  First of all, the Egyptians, displaying an unexpected mastery of engineering technique, built no fewer than ten bridges over the Canal by the end of October 7 - an achievement which enabled them to pour tanks and other heavy equipment across much faster than the Israelis had thought possible.  More shocking yet, every Israeli counterthrust had been thrown back, with appalling losses.  Those supposedly inferior Egyptian troops did not falter in the face of the immediate and violent Israeli counterattacks, but bravely stood their ground - knocking out better than 300 Israeli tanks in the first three days of the war.  Finally, when the Israeli Air Force was sent to the rescue of the hard-pressed ground forces, it ran into an almost impenetrable wall of antiaircraft guns and SAMs (including the hitherto unknown - and very deadly - Soviet SA-6s) that took a dreadful toll of the attacking Phantoms and Skyhawks.&#10;&#10;History tells us that the Israelis managed to overcome the initial consequences of their own hubris and overconfidence, and reverse the course of the war, through a combination of sheer guts, brilliant improvisation, and superior technique in mobile warfare.  Yet, the outcome of the war along the Suez Canal was, to quote Wellington, &quot;A very near run thing,&quot; that might easily have ended in a humiliating Israeli defeat.&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE    12 hours per turn&#10;MAP SCALE    2.5 miles per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE    Battalion / Brigade&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS    One to four&#10;PLAYING TIME    Two to twelve hours&#10;&#10;";1995;6.50189;3.4848

First, two arch construction supports are placed on the base. Then thirteen color-coded cube compartments are placed on top of the supports to create an arch. The supports are then removed, so that the compartments support each other in a free-standing arch.&#10;&#10;Players attempt to place 50 playing pieces of various colors and shapes into the color-coded compartments, without knocking the arch over. On a player's turn, they roll the two dice--one of which tells how many pieces they must place, and the second die tells the color of the compartment into which the pieces must be placed. When 'Arch Rival' is rolled on the color die, one of the player's opponents is allowed to select the color of the required compartment. Players continue placing pieces in turn, until the point where arch can no longer support itself and collapses. The player who causes this to happen loses the game.&#10;&#10;";1992;5.32356;1.2632

2162;Warhammer 40,000 (Third Edition);"Warhammer 40,000 is a table-top miniature-based war game set in a dystopian future. Although usually played by two players, theoretically any number of players can participate at once.&#10;&#10;Players can choose one of a number of factions from within the Warhammer 40,000 universe - examples include, humanity's defenders, the Space Marines and Imperial Guard, the nearly extinct race of Eldar, the all-consuming Tyranids or the corrupted once-human forces of Chaos. Each race also how their own sub-groups and flavours - for example there are Chapters of Space Marines with their own specialisations, whilst a Chaos army that worships the war-god Khorne would look very different to one worshiping the pleasure god Slaanesh.&#10;&#10;Players select their armies based on the miniatures they own. To ensure balance each miniature is assigned a points value (with the value rising for optional upgrades) and players usually agree a points limit for each army before play. Similarly, players will agree the rules and victory conditions for a specific scenario.&#10;&#10;Each turn proceeds in phases covering movement, melee combat, ranged combat and so forth. No game board is used, players make or purchase their own scenery. Physical measurement is used to determine movement and weapon range, with dice used to calculate everything from damage to morale and the effectiveness of physic powers.

Each slide puzzle has 6 edge points marked with a number from 1-6.  Tiles with the letters A-E are randomly inserted in the five slots between the puzzles.  The puzzles consist of tiles with paths on them; each tile contains either a straight line or a line with a 90-degree turn.  A letter and a number are randomly selected, then the players race to build a path with their tiles connecting the exit points with the chosen letter and number.&#10;&#10;Cool, real time, Alex Randolph game that has been reimplemented both as a Sudoku (Sudoku Slide!) and as a Rubik (Rubik's Race) game.&#10;&#10;";1972;6.20875;1.1667
2166;Wyvern;"You command an army of Dragons engaged in battle with your opponent's Dragon army. Each game of Wyvern is a struggle for domination of the tabletop Battlefield; your objective is to completely clear your opponent's Battlefield of Dragon and Terrain cards. To accomplish this, you will use your Dragons to attack cards in the enemy's Battlefield. However, your Dragons will not fight for you free of charge. Dragons love gold, so in Wyvern you must pay your Dragons to fight. You start with a bankroll of 25 gold pieces, and you are trying to clear your opponent's Battlefield while spending as little of your gold as possible.&#10;&#10;Wyvern, one of the first CCG's after Magic, is played with two decks.  One deck holds your dragons and terrain cards.  The other deck has your treasure cards and action cards.&#10;&#10;To set up the game you take the top six cards from your dragon deck and lay them face down in two rows of three cards.  Your front three dragons can fight the opponents front three dragons so you do have to be careful how you place.  Flying dragons can fight over one row.  Each player gets 25 gold (any markers you supply) and draws seven cards from their action deck.  On your turn...&#10;&#10;&#10;     You draw a card from your action deck.&#10;     Place a treasure or replace a treasure.  You may have up to two treasures per row.&#10;     You may change the position of one or two cards in your grid.&#10;     All players may play action cards one at a time around the table until everyone has played as many as they want.&#10;     You must choose one dragon to attack or replace a dragon or terrain card in your grid with the top card from your dragon deck face down.  A dragon can attack a face up card or a face down card hoping he can beat it.  Dragon numbers are compared and the strongest wins.  A losing dragon or terrain is not replaced and you lose by losing all six positions.&#10;     A second action phase now ensues.&#10;     You must discard down to seven cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;See also Dragon Hunt&#10;&#10;";1994;5.30925;2.2
2168;Hitler's War;"The game examines the war in Europe at several levels. Operation Barbarossa concentrates on the great ground struggle waged for four long years between Stalingrad and Berlin. The Fall of Germany begins at the eve of the great amphibious invasion of France and expands the war into the West. The War for Europe completes the picture with an examination of the entire 6 years of war in all of its ramifications. Great fleets of bombers may be launched towards enemy targets; swift Axis raiders joined by their deadly brethren, the U-Boat, can attempt to break the British supply line with America; mighty armadas may sail to challenge, in combat, for control of the seas, and much more.&#10;&#10;But Hitler's War does not limit one to just the kind of tactical or strategic decisions normally expected from a wargame. The great choices that faced each government must also be solved. Questions relating to war direction, production priorities, and research allotments become as important to ultimate victory as when to invade Russia or how much force will be needed to overrun France. Should the Allies attempt victory through airpower ? How much should the Axis invest in large mechanized armies versus the construction of U-boats ? And who could build the atomic bomb first ?&#10;&#10;&#10;(from the back of Avalon Hill edition box:)&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;    260 1/2-inch counters (520 in all)&#10;    1 16&quot; x 22&quot; mounted mapboard&#10;    1 rules booklet&#10;    3 8&quot; x 13&quot; player aid cards&#10;    1 six-sided die&#10;&#10;&#10;Time Scale: three turns per year&#10;Map Scale: ca. 300 km per hex&#10;Players: two or three (varies with scenario)&#10;Playing Time: from 1 and 1/2 hours for the first scenario to 5 hours for an entire campaign&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability : High&#10;Complexity: medium&#10;&#10;";1981;6.28619;2.9726
2172;Stealth Chess;"Stealth Chess is a chess-under-imperfect-information variant, a kind of cross between chess and Stratego. In name and power, the pieces are standard chessmen, but they are shaped like Stratego pieces so that each player can only identify the pieces of his own army. At the start both sides arrange their armies any way they like on the first two ranks. Pawns are allowed to move two squares forward on either the first or second rank. The object is to capture the enemy King. The identity of a piece is revealed when it is captured. The official rules then call for the piece to be returned to its previous owner (off the board), facing away from its captor.&#10;&#10;Stealth Chess has the same pieces as conventional chess(16 Black &amp; 16 White) but unlike traditional chess, all pieces look the same and have the pieces title printed on the back side so your only chance to win is to memorize the movement of your opponents and which piece was moved. This memory play helps with regular chess play by improving your memory.&#10;&#10;The game begins with pieces being randomly placed by each player in the first and second row of each side of the board. You decide the strategic possibilities of the placement of your pieces. For example, you might put your Queen front-row center and hide your King in a corner. The excitement begins with the first move. From that point forward, you must try to figure out your opponent's pieces by their movements and seek out and capture the King. Of course, you may &quot;disguise&quot; a powerful piece by moving it as if it were a mere Pawn--until you strike without warning. No check, no checkmate. Boom! Victory is yours.&#10;&#10;There are several different rule sets included that the players agree upon beforehand. The simplest is a standard opening position setup. You'll know which piece is which at the beginning of the game and the trick is to remember.&#10;&#10;";1997;5.84375;1.6667
2173;4 Player Chess;"Four-Player Chess (Four-handed chess, Chess-4, and 4-Chess) is often credited to Capt Charles Verney, who was the first known to have documented the game in England in 1881.  Four-player versions of chess probably have existed for hundreds of years prior to Verney in one form or another.  Verney's four-player board consists of three rows added to each side of a standard 2-player board, and four complete sets of chessmen in four different colors.  Modern four-player boards and colored pieces are available from several manufacturers.&#10;&#10;In Verney's version (1881), 4 player chess was a partnership game, and the object was to checkmate both opposing partners at the same time.  In modern variants, four player games can range from partners, to cutthroat (every player for himself), to temporary alliances at will.&#10;&#10;Starting configuration affects fairness (bias).  The standard 2-player configuration of queen facing queen is biased in four player chess because there is only one axis of symmetry.  Four player chess requires two axes of symmetry to be fair (unbiased).  To avoid bias, Verney recommended a staring configuration of all queens on light (or all on dark) squares.  Another unbiased starting configuration is all queens on the right (or all on the left) of the king.&#10;&#10;For the most part, four player chess follows (or can follow) all the normal rules of two-player chess.  Verney had special rules for partnership playing, disallowed castling, and pawns had to make it to the enemies last rank in order to be exchanged for another piece.  Pawns could also march up and back down the board.  Verney also had checkmate as the ultimate move.&#10;&#10;In modern variations of four-player chess, partnering may not be required, but allowable, castling can be allowed, and actual capturing of a king a required move to eliminate a player.  The Chess Federation does not recognize four-player chess in any form, and there are no official rules, so players are free to experiment with variations and make their own rules.&#10;&#10;See also:&#10;&#10;        Bughouse Chess&#10;        Vendetta&#10;&#10;&#10;";1881;5.96839;2.8889

2175;Willi Wacker;"Willi Wacker, apparently, is the German name for comic-strip character Andy Capp, who provides the theme for this game. Players seek to play same-number or sequential-number sets of cards from their hands to the table (the cards are numbered 1-8). Picture cards add wrinkles such as allowing players to steal cards from the hands or played sets of opponents. Card sets and the points they bring are safe only when the correct picture card - Andy/Willi finally getting a beer - is played.&#10;&#10;";1986;5.5274;1.0

2178;RÃ¶mer;"A fairly complex trick-taking card game in which players attempt to assemble a high-value team of horses to pull their chariots. Players pick a personal trump color, and  one card of this color serves as their chariot. Up to six other cards - or &quot;horses&quot; - may be added to the pile formed by the chariot, and all will score according to values on the cards. Bonuses are received if the horses are of the trump color selected by the player, but placing trump cards into the chariot can be dangerous, as players are penalized if their trump suit is played and they do not follow suit. Each turn, a player may begin a trick or place a card from his hand onto his chariot pile.&#10;&#10;";1990;5.4537;1.8
2179;Musketeers;"From the rules overview: &quot;In the Queen&rsquo;s service, the Musketeers are trying to acquire three valuable gems. However, the Cardinal and his dreaded Guards are out to sabotage the Musketeers&rsquo; mission. Many skirmishes between the Musketeers and the Guards ensue. The most successful Musketeers will be awarded gems. Those who fail will be sent to prison and will remain empty handed.&quot;&#10;&#10;Setup: remove some specific cards depending on the number of players. Shuffle and place all Guard cards in the center, along with the Gem and Prison cards. Shuffle the Musketeer cards and deal 12 each.&#10;&#10;Play: players select 3 cards to place face down; these are their potential rewards (Pay cards) this fight. Reveal the top Guard. Players simultaneously select a card, then reveal. If the sum is lower than the Guard strength, the player playing the lowest card places a Prison card on one of his Pay cards. Otherwise, the player with the highest card either places a Gem card on one of his Pay cards, or returns one of his Prison cards to the center. If center area doesn't have a card you need, take it from another player. If all you have 3 Prison cards, your played card doesn't add to the other players' cards.&#10;&#10;The round ends after 9 fights. Players earn silver for their Pay cards, doubled if a Gem is on top and reduced to 0 if a Prison is on top. The player with the most coins wins. Alternatively, keep playing rounds till someone gets 100 or more points, and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;";1991;6.08045;1.1071

2181;Bridge;"Bridge is a standard deck, trick taking card game that pits two partnerships against each other. The first part of the game is the auction, by which partners attempt to communicate information about their hands by bidding, in order to arrive at a successful contract. The contract specifies how many tricks must be taken by the team that wins the bid. After the auction, a member of the team that won the bid tries to win as many tricks as possible while playing both hands from the partnership. One hand is played normally while the other (the &quot;dummy hand&quot;) is placed face-up on the table, allowing for greater control. The defenders attempt to take enough tricks to make the contract fail.&#10;&#10;The formal name of the game is Contract Bridge, but the shortened name &quot;Bridge&quot; is the most common usage. Bridge developed from the 17th Century card game Whist. The earliest form of Bridge originated in 1886 when rules were introduced allowing the dealer to choose a trump and their partner's hand to become dummy. Bridge became Auction Bridge in 1904, which allowed the trump suit to be decided by the highest bidding partnership. Harold Vanderbilt transformed Auction Bridge into Contract Bridge in 1925, when he introduced an improved method of scoring.&#10;&#10;The duplicate version of the game has many pairs of partners, each playing the same hands separately and comparing their results. This method removes the element of luck in getting good cards when comparing players and thus helps to isolate the role of skill in the game.&#10;&#10;";1925;7.46137;3.8927

The active player then rolls two dice to determine two or more fields (such as 31 and 13, for instance - special rules apply for rolling doubles).

These cards, Kirk, Spock, McCoy and the Enterprise, are in every starter. This is a blessing in that most CCG's make the most popular characters very rare.&#10;&#10;The game can be multi-player but is designed for and best with only two players.  Each player takes turns being the &quot;Current Player&quot;: the crew of the Enterprise, while the opposing player represents the obstacles to the crew as the &quot;Challenging Player&quot;.&#10;&#10;The game revolves around completing episodes as the Current Player. Each episode is made up of three cards, Mission, Plot and Discovery. You have all three cards in a generic form that you can play if you did not draw one of the types.&#10;&#10;You play a mission card then the opponent plays challenges against it. You then play a plot card and more challenges. Then a discovery card and yep, more challenges (well&hellip; really you just resolve any outstanding challenges). At the end each side gets points called XC for how they did or did not do during the Episode phase.  The Current player gets XC for completing the episode while the Challenger gets XC for stifling the Current Player's efforts.&#10;&#10;XC is put on the core crew and crew you enter on your side and the first player to end their turn with 25+ XC total on the crew wins.

Then pick your club, place the range-finder on the board and roll for your shot.  First you roll on the distance table then on the direction table to determin where your shot landed.

2201;Redemption;"Redemption(&trade;) is a Bible-based collectible card game (CCG). Created in 1995 by Rob Anderson of Cactus Game Design Inc. as a Christian faith alternative to Magic the Gathering, Redemption (&trade;) is the 2nd-longest running CCG in existence (after Magic). As of 2023, 6 starter sets and 24 expansion sets have been released, along with many promotional cards. There are over 4500 unique Redemption cards in print - including variants and reprints.&#10;&#10;For all of the impressive numbers, what is even more impressive is that every single Redemption card is based on a character, event, or concept from the Bible and has its own identifying Bible verse(s). Moreover, most cards&rsquo; special abilities tie directly into their verse&rsquo;s meaning or topic.&#10;&#10;Going further - the game is a simple-to-learn, complex-to-master strategy game. Unlike most other CCGs, it is 2-sided: each player plays offense and defense, and will build each into their customized deck.&#10;&#10;So how do you play? In a nutshell, the first player to rescue 5 lost souls (in &ldquo;Type 1&rdquo; format, or 7 Lost Souls in Type 2 format) is the winner. Lost Souls are rescued by using Heroes on offense, and strategically overcoming your opponent&rsquo;s defensive villains, called Evil Characters. Each time you do that, you rescue 1 Lost Soul card, and the turn is passed for your opponent to play offense with their Heroes and against your defensive Evil Characters. Hundreds of unique special abilities create endless play combinations and deep strategy, for extremely high replay value for the game. Once you get into Redemption, you&rsquo;ll always enjoy tweaking - or completely scrapping and starting over - decks, acquiring new cards, trying new strategies, and testing yourself against opponents in casual and tournament settings.&#10;&#10;Speaking of tournaments, every year there is a long tournament season, filled with local, district, state, and regional tournaments, as well as a national tournament, that anyone can attend. The national tournament, known within the community as &quot;Nationals&quot;, is usually hosted in the summer months of July or August. This event is a 3 day tournament where every legal category is played to determine a National Champion of that category for the year. Also, at this point, the annual ranking system for players which awards points for top 3 finishes in sanctioned tournaments throughout the year is finalized and the winners are announced. All National winners and winners of a category in the annual ranking system for a category receive special National Winner Promos. These are some of the coolest looking cards in the game and are highly sought after as playable collectibles.&#10;&#10;Though of course far from perfect, being a Christian game in which most players who play are Christians, there is also a wonderful community that has been established over the past 25 years. So many players are welcoming and encouraging to newcomers and veterans alike, and there is an online message board and Discord channel in which conversation goes on daily. This is a community in which players feel just as natural about asking a strategy question about the game as sharing a personal prayer topic - trusting that they will be treated with respect and care no matter what. This active community of Redemption players, which includes the team of Elders (the game's leadership group), have really worked hard to make it about as easy to join the game as can be. There are tremendous community driven resources to provide plenty of engagement with new and active players alike. In addition to the message boards and Discord, the game has an active subreddit, a blog site with contributions from the broad community of players, active Youtubers and even two podcasts - One a weekly source of content spanning various topics of the game and the other a biweekly dive into high level competitive gameplay.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.10428;2.5625
2202;Swahili;"This is a pretty straight forward adaption of Mancala. The three dimensional board is made up of 11 rows (circles) and a middle pit. The first 6 rows are safe and each player has their own along with a pit for prisoners. There are then 5 circular rows that anybody can move into and a pit in the middle for scoring.  To start the game you place 3 pieces on each of your first 4 rows. You pick a row and move all pieces in it, dropping one piece off at every row you pass. If your last piece comes to rest in a row with other of your pieces you may pick them up and move with them also. Upon getting a pawn to the middle pit you drop one in and start placing the pieces starting along row one again. If your last piece ends in a row that an opponent has a single piece in you capture it and place it in your prisoner pit. If more then one opponent has a single piece in the last row you place in you capture all of them.&#10;&#10;When one player has no pieces left, through dropping them in the middle pit or being captured, the game is over. Each piece captured is worth 5 points and each piece in the middle pit is worth 10 points.&#10;&#10;";1968;5.9;1.0

2205;The Lost World Jurassic Park Game;"Based on the second movie, of course. This tri-lingual (English, Spanish, French) crowded MB box contains a whole bunch of thin cardboard 3D buildings; stand up cardboard pieces for the 12 humans and the helicopter, and a bunch of plastic miniatures of the dinosaurs (a T-Rex and some Velociraptors). This is played in teams, the human team trying to get 3 humans off the board via the chopper, and the dinosaur team trying to prevent this. When 3 play, the third player alternates teams.&#10;&#10;The humans can jump between building roofs or can run between them. Unfortunately, the dinosaurs move a lot faster on the ground than the humans (the humans move between marked spaces, the dinosaurs between zones). Buildings have several entry/exit points for the humans but only one for the raptors. Dice indicate how to move humans and dinosaurs; one of the dice has Stop/Go markings which control whether you may roll again or not --making movement harder to predict. Jumping (for humans) and entering buildings (for dinosaurs) is also dice controlled. The T-Rex is confined to a single board edge area; its function is to flush the humans from the starting building -- once he reaches it, all remaining humans are devoured!&#10;&#10;Yes, unlike the first movie game, in this one there is death aplenty. As soon as a dinosaur enters a space with humans in it, even when just passing through, they're all eaten. Tastes like chicken.&#10;&#10;An alternate game consists of two plays, with teams switching allegiance. The winning team is then the one that saves the most humans.&#10;&#10;From the same film series:&#10;&#10;    Jurassic Park Game&#10;    Jurassic Park III: Island Survival Game&#10;&#10;&#10;";1996;6.01938;1.5556
2206;Jurassic Park Game;"Based on the first movie, of course. This huge Milton Bradley box contains an over-sized board with a rather flimsy Visitor Center building; stand up cardboard pieces for the various movie characters, and a bunch of plastic miniatures of the more dangerous dinosaurs (a T-Rex, Velociraptors, and Dilophosaurus).&#10;You start off at the other end of the island and try to make it to the Visitor Center. There are some safe spaces on the board (maintenance sheds) that allow you to refresh your hand of cards as a bonus. Cards allow you to move, move faster along the road, escape a dinosaur or cancel another player's card. On your turn, you roll dice that indicate which dinosaur you may move. You then move yourself one space, play a card or trade in cards. The dinosaurs don't kill anyone (unlike in the movie!) -- they just pin you down until the dinosaur is moved away or an escape card is played.&#10;&#10;Although the box says 2-4 players, there are pieces for up to 8, which leads to a lot more mayhem (but a longer game).&#10;&#10;";1993;5.26743;1.4167

You race your competitors to acquire valuable property, you sell key plots of land at inflated prices, you construct buildings to bring in a high return on your investment.  Where to buy, when to sell, when to build, what to build --those are the questions!&#10;&#10;A classic game in the same vein as Big City or Metropolis (q.v.).&#10;&#10;from Waddington ad dated 1976:  &quot;Land, one of the hottest commodities in the economic world today!  Everyone is scrambling for it - developers, speculators, and the poor guy who just wants a place to live.

Or on top of other balls --as long as you own a majority of the four balls on top of which you're placing.  You win by having the topmost ball when no more placements are possible.  I suspect there may be a Nim-like winning strategy, as the game is completely deterministic and there's gotta be a first-player advantage.&#10;&#10;";1969;6.5;0.0

2212;eBay Electronic Talking Auction Game;"Players use cards to bid on various items that might come up for sale on eBay. An electronic gizmo determines turn order and decides when a particular auction is over. Players only have a few seconds to place a bid when their color is called by the gizmo or a buzzer will sound and bidding moves to another player. Items up for bid are shown with an estimated value. The real value of the item can be higher or lower and known only when a player actually wins the bidding on that item. Players can double-score items if they can get a collection of three or more items of the same color/category. The game gizmo requires 3 AAA batteries (not included).&#10;&#10;";2001;5.95022;1.2581

In the second game, the Terran player tries to defend himself against revolting houses in league with invading aliens, the Silakka.  In the third game, Terra is neutral, while up to four players try to create the most powerful house on Imirrhos!&#10;&#10;";1981;6.36664;1.9697

Each player takes a heroic figure and attempts to perform deeds that will generate enough glory to ensure that the hero's memory will live in the sagas composed after his or her death.&#10;&#10;To gain glory, the heros slay monsters, accumulate treasure hoards, recruit lesser heros (&quot;jarls&quot;, or earls) as their companions, and establish kingdoms.  The hero who gains the most glory is the one whose fame will live on in the sagas, while the others are doomed to be forgotten by posterity.  Each player must be decisive and alert to grasp chances and avoid having other heroes gain glory at his or her expense.&quot;&#10;&#10;";1980;5.91241;1.7083
2215;They've Invaded Pleasantville;"Part of TSR's minigame series.  From the rulebook...&#10;&#10;&quot;They've Invaded Pleasantville&quot; minigame is a two player wargame of secret invasion by Space Invaders.  One player, the Alien player, moves the Alien-controlled and uncontrolled pieces, and the other player, the Town player, moves the Town-controlled pieces.  There are 12 game turns in this game. In any given turn, playing pieces representing various townspeople will be moved across the gamemap, which is a map of Pleasantville.&#10;&#10;The Alien player will try to keep the whereabouts of the Alien-controlled townspeople a secret, while he or she &quot;takes over&quot; more unsuspecting townspeople and builds up strength for the final showdown with the Town player.  The Alien player, in short, will try to create a large army of townspeople-zombies, eliminate any opposition, and occupy Pleasantville as a base of operations.  The Town player will try to convince the townspeople that there is an alien menace in the town, and will attempt to fight any Alien-controlled townspeople encountered.  With luck and careful play, the Town player hopes to defeat the Alien-controlled&quot;zombies&quot;, locate the Alien Headquarters, and destroy the Alien Sub-Commander.&#10;&#10;The game mechanic involves use of two identical sets of carboard chits - one set having a star on the back indicating alien control. Each turn, the alien player may use misdirection and bluffing to fool the town player as to where the alien mind control is taking place. Real townspeople are &quot;swapped out&quot; with alien controlled ones and the town player must stop the spread of control sooner than later. A fun game for two players who enjoy bluffing and like simulating the action of classic movies like Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Invaders from Mars. Especially entertaining is the random Townsperson Movement table that simulates the day to day migration of unsuspecting townspeople as they go about their business in Pleasantville.&#10;&#10;";1981;6.08328;2.1111
2216;Vampyre;"Part of TSR's minigame series. From the rulebook...&#10;&#10;&quot;The Vampyre game is faithful to Stoker's original novel. It may be played by up to 6 people, each playing the role of one of Stoker's characters. Many of the game elements are also derived from the book. In Stoker's novel, Dracula did indeed hide coffins in various secret locations so that he would always have a place to hide during the day, should his principle (sic?) lair be discovered. Dracula did have vampire brides and could command wolves, rats, bears and other supernatural beings. Effective against these un-dead creatures were The Host, holy water, crucifixes and silver bullets; not to mention the hammer and stake - tools required for dispatching vampires.&#10;&#10;The Vampyre basic game takes place on the map of Transylvania. The game is a race between the vampire hunters to see who will be the first to find and destroy three of Count Dracula's hidden coffins.&#10;&#10;The extended game is played on the reverse side of the map, Dracula's Castle, after the players have finished the basic game. Here, the players have already destroyed Dracula's hidden coffins. Now they must track down and destroy the Count himself in his heavily guarded lair.&quot;&#10;&#10;";1981;6.27264;1.5

2219;Forte;"The better you do, the tougher it gets!&#10;&#10;The board is a 6x6 grid with pathways between and outside the grid points (&quot;forts&quot;).  At either end of the board, the starting spaces abutt the seven pathways.  The object is to form a row of four contiguous forts, horizontally, vertically or diagonally.  You move a &quot;knight&quot; by entering one of the four surrounding pathways (there is only one possible pathway when the knight is in a starting position), sliding along it in a straight line as far as you wish, then hop off the pathway into an adjacent empty fort.  You must use one of the four &quot;outside&quot; knights to open the game.&#10;&#10;Upon winning a &quot;joust&quot;, you mark the win using a knight, so you're handicapped for the next jousts.  The first player to win 3 jousts wins the game.&#10;&#10;";1981;5.6;0.0
2220;Ion Glory;"Ion Glory is an interstellar confrontation simulation, a strategic card game set in the unforgiving realm of space.  Maintain your planetary alliance, economics and keep the odd Kothian out of your parsec!  Starships move vast stretches of space in the blink of an eye, making a board or playing pieces unnecessary.  Players purchase ships made by all races, allowing for an interesting mix of weaponry in every fleet.  Advanced rules allow for boarding parties, secret weapons, weapon refitting, planetary and ship capture, terrorism and sabotage.&#10;&#10;The company truly deserves its name as the game comes unmounted and uncut --you must even supply the required pair of dice.  This is crude desktop-publishing grade, but it looks like fun.&#10;&#10;";1994;2.0;0.0
2221;Clobber!;"Each player starts with three pawns on his home space.  To move a pawn out to the home space's exit space, a 1 or 6 must be rolled.  On each die throw, a single pawn is moved.  Upon landing on a starred space, you roll again; on a 1 or 6, you move to the central circle from whence you may exit to any starred space on a later turn.  You clobber enemy pawns by landing on them --they're sent back to their home space.&#10;&#10;The winner is the first player to place his pawns on their arrival spaces (by exact count).&#10;&#10;(The board consists of a three-lobed track; it touches the central star circle at its three innermost points.  The player home/start spaces are arrayed around the outside of the track, whilst the ending circles are inside the track (but each uses an outer circle's exit space as its entry space).  The inner circles are all made up of three different-coloured arrival spaces; the distribution is such that each player must reach the last three circles of a full circuit to win.&#10;&#10;A member of the Parcheesi family of board games.&#10;&#10;";1977;3.13333;1.0

2223;UNO;"Players race to empty their hands and catch opposing players with cards left in theirs, which score points. In turns, players attempt to play a card by matching its color, number, or word to the topmost card on the discard pile. If unable to play, players draw a card from the draw pile, and if still unable to play, they pass their turn. Wild and special cards spice things up a bit.&#10;&#10;UNO is a commercial version of Crazy Eights, a public domain card game played with a standard deck of playing cards.&#10;&#10;This entry includes all themed versions of UNO that do not include new cards.&#10;&#10;";1971;5.46631;1.1029
2224;Circus Imperium;"Circus Imperium is a tongue in cheek chariot racing game loosely based on FASA's RPG Renegade Legion.  Players attempt to complete three circuts while keeping their chariots and drivers intact. The main challenge is manuvering around the bends while attempting to disable or block your opponents.  The game has some brief miniature rules and provisions for all sorts of carnage.  Manuvering cards also add a bit of randomness to the race.  Not for the serious strategist, but all in all a nice fun diversion.&#10;&#10;";1988;6.80055;2.1304
2225;Bamboozle;"Comes with a gadget that serves as both a letter cube randomizer and a two-sided timer. One team creates a list of five words from the letters showing on the letter cubes.

2226;Greyhounds;"Players place secret bets and then race their greyhounds in a series of three races, each one longer than the previous one. Players have sets of number cards from which one is selected and simultaneously revealed each turn. Only the greyhound with the highest number showing will move, advancing a number of spaces equal to the difference between the highest numbered card and the second highest. The player with the most money after three races wins.&#10;&#10;";1985;6.35936;2.0
2227;The Flea Market Game;"Just like the real Flea Market, you need to buy low and sell high.  Is the porcelain vase really from the Ming Dynasty or from Joe Bob's Ceramic Creations?  Can you tell?  If you think a seller is a black-hearted pirate, you can challenge the scoundrel.  If you're right you get the goods for free!  But, if you wrongfully accuse an honest merchant, you will pay dearly.  What's your selling style?&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to make money.  You do this by renting spaces and selling your Big Deal cards.  Once a player has sold all of his Big Deal cards, it's Closing Time --any Big Deal cards leftover in other players' hands are deducted from their score.&#10;&#10;Big Deal cards are displayed for all to see during play, with the Fair Price hidden on the back.  There are duplicates of each item, with sometimes wildly different fair prices.  Sets of four Big Deal cards of the same colour can be cashed in when passing the Wholesaler (Start Space).  You bargain for Big Deal cards when you land on a seller's space.  Only two offers and two counter-offers are allowed, to limit bargaining time.  The agreed-upon price is multiplied by the number of cards of that colour the buyer already holds (but never more than four times).&#10;&#10;If you think the seller was asking for more than the Fair Price, you may call a Challenge.  You are secretly shown the Fair Price to resolve the challenge.  If you were right, you get the card; otherwise, you must pay the Fair Price multiplied by *twice* the number of cards of that colour you already hold.&#10;&#10;Of course, role-playing (haggling) is encouraged.&#10;&#10;";1986;6.71429;0.0
2228;War of the Ring;"'War of the Ring'. On a large map of Middle Earth, armies are mustering and heroes are readying to fight the shadow spreading out of Mordor. The game is played on two levels. Both sides (or three if someone wants to play Saruman) have great armies that battle in a typical wargame style while another game is going on at the same time with individual characters around the fate of the One Ring. In the Campaign game Sauron's forces are the more powerful but the free peoples get the edge in the Character game.&#10;&#10;Highly sought after as a collectors item. It could be purchased with either a paper map or a full mounted map, and was also sold in a three-game set with the folio games Gondor: The Siege of Minas Tirith and Sauron.  That trilogy set is called The Games of Middle Earth.&#10;&#10;";1977;6.68364;3.466
2229;Spiel;"Unusual, tetrahedral board with 121 dice in three colors. A series of games, some involving dexterity, other abstract movement. A gaming system in which the inventor encourages players to devise new games. Aesthetically interesting.&#10;&#10;First published by Edition Perlhuhn in 1980 (301 dice for 57 games), by Kosmos in 1986 (281 dice) and re-issued by Abacus in 2004 with 166 dice and fewer games. In 2011, Abacus revived it yet again, but with only 121 dice.&#10;&#10;The Kosmos edition shows age range &quot;4-99&quot; on its box, the latest edition shows &quot;6+&quot; instead.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    &quot;55&quot;, published in 2005 by Abacus&#10;&#10;&#10;";1980;6.12478;1.625
2230;Ayanu;"This game is 'Chess-like' in many ways: two players have identical sets of game pieces starting on opposite sides of a square grid. Players move one piece per turn and can eliminate the other player's pieces by moving into their space. Movement options depend on which piece it is you're moving. In a fit of conspicuous difference, it's the black side who makes the opening move here.&#10;&#10;The central gimmick is that each piece is composed of two parts, a body and a head. The height of the body determines how far a piece can move (one, two or three spaces), whereas the head determines the directions: straight lines (like rooks), diagonals (like bishops), or both (like kings or queens). Each side also has one super-powered queen/rook hybrid which can move to any space within the range determined by its body, and even one unbeatable but immobile head.&#10;&#10;There's a reason for all this separation into bodies and heads: after every move the piece which just moved must swap heads with a different type of head, chosen by the player from their pieces still in play.&#10;&#10;There are two victory conditions: either you move one of your pieces to a specific target square on the far side of the board, or you force your opponent to make an illegal move. Draws are possible, but rare (they require both sides' forces to be extremely depleted).&#10;&#10;The theme is pretty much irrelevant - this is an abstract at heart. The rulebook frames the game as the secret strategy-honing tool of the nobles in a fictional culture, and the rules introduction is presented in dialogue form with the Wise Old Master teaching the game to his Young Noble Student, but none of this is at all relevant to gameplay. In fact, the game presented within the fiction is themeless and, quite literally, abstract: the pieces' names are translated as abstract concepts like 'strength' etc.&#10;&#10;";1987;7.02453;2.2857
2231;Watch;"Watch, a.k.a. Quick, is a game of tactics. The 25 wooden playing pieces in 10 different colors are placed on the 25 squares on the board. Each player has a playing token and in turn places their token over one of the wooden playing pieces on the board, but the second player can't choose the same color as the first. Following the rules of play, tokens are moved until one player either:&#10;&#10;&#10;    manages to move their token onto the piece occupied by their opponent, capturing it;&#10;    moves their token onto a piece of the same color as the piece on which their opponent's piece stands; or&#10;    ensures that their opponent is unable to move since all pieces in a vertical or horizontal line from the opposing token have already been removed.&#10;&#10;&#10;";1967;6.04;2.0
2233;Colliding Circles;"Board is a series of circles, nineteen interlocked, each with six circular spaces. Each player has a hand of five dice which are placed on the circles.By forming number patterns with your circles you score points. What's particularly interesting is that you can move the dice-pieces and in so doing change the numbers. This is a highly original, uniquely interesting game, with a number of innovative mechanisms that flow nicely together. It's a territorial game, slightly reminiscent of GO, but with an engaging, even exciting random factor (each turn you throw one or two dice to replenish your hand).&#10;&#10;";1995;6.75;2.0
2234;Chez Dork;"Inspired by the success of Chez Geek, Steve Jackson presents another John Kovalic inspiration. This game is about buying the latest geeky gadgets and gamer items. Each player takes on the personality of one of the stars of Kovalic's comic &quot;Dork Tower&quot; in an attempt to purchase and possess the items that satisfy their obsessions. Of course, tastes are prone to change (one week it's LARPs, the next it's Computer Games), so players are constantly trying to purchase/trade/auction items so as to reach a certain number of points (items in your obsession count double towards victory). A light-hearted game with loads of gamer/otaku/LARP humor makes this a nice filler game that anyone can play.&#10;&#10;NOTE: Some form of currency/money is needed to play this game.&#10;&#10;";2001;5.28737;1.3

2236;Streets of Stalingrad;"&quot;Streets of Stalingrad&quot; is a World War 2 East Front wargame that models the fight for the city of Stalingrad, September-October, 1942, at the company level. It employs a scale of 300 meters per hex, with daily turns and 2160 counters.&#10;&#10;The two designers spent years researching the orders of battle and aerial maps to produce a game that is possibly the most researched and arguably the most accurate depiction of a battle, mechanics aside.&#10;&#10;The large, fairly thin but sturdy counters are the shades of the uniforms of the armies according to the designers. Instead of the usual American style designations on the counters to depict what type of unit it is, the designers used the actual designations used by the separate armies. This could be confusing except for the wonderful large player aids supplied with actual photos of the unit types. Labels and ziplock bag are even supplied for sorting purposes although sorting can be confusing. Moves mag put out an issue in the late '70's, early '80's with an article that fixed the problem.&#10;&#10;The 3 large maps are taken straight from aerial photos. You see the city block by block and outside the city individual buildings can even be seen. There is very little color on the maps but they are beautiful and very functional. The terrain effects chart once again has actual photos of the terrain so you can get an idea of exactly what the soldiers were facing.&#10;&#10;There are many scenarios available so you can tailor the game for time and room as some only use 1 map or a portion of a map. Each scenario has a separate set up sheet for both sides that are large enough to put all the counters on the sheets. Each scenario has a miniature version of the map to be used with set up information. For a monster game it is very easy to set up and get into a game.&#10;&#10;There are 3 rulebooks included, 2 basic game and 1 advanced game. When learning the game it is fantastic that they included a rulebook for each player. This is the kind of detail that is evident throughout the game. The rule books are detailed without being overbearing, as a lot of Avalon Hill's and SPI's were from the time period. They are chock full of examples to clear up ambiguities.&#10;&#10;The game is difficult because of the scale only. It is actually a fairly simple game, mechanics wise, and can be played by anyone with some wargame experience. This game shows that it has been designed to play, by wargamers, in every detail.&#10;&#10;";1979;7.61377;4.2727

Examples of categories are 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind, straight, full house, etc.  Each player tries to fill in a score for each category, but this is not always possible.  When all players have entered a score or a zero for all 13 categories, the game ends and total scores are compared.&#10;&#10;The traditional (public domain) game Yacht predates the trademarked game, and has slightly different scoring.&#10;&#10;There are four basic scoring difference between the tradition game Yacht and Yahtzee.  They are:  1) Yacht has no Three of a Kind category, 2) there are no bonuses in Yacht, 3) there are no Joker rules in Yacht, and 4) the Full House category is scored as the sum of the dice.  The other scoring rules are identical between the two games.&#10;&#10;Travel versions of the game use a device that keeps the dice captured within compartments of a plastic box and allows players to &quot;lock&quot; a particular die between rolls.&#10;&#10;";1956;5.51977;1.1754
2247;Zero!: The Rise and Fall of The Imperial Japanese Air Force Dec 1941 - June 1942;"(from the GMT Website:)&#10;&#10;Volume III in the Down in Flames card game series moves to the Pacific Theatre of Operations in WWII. Players will recreate the first six months of furious aerial combat between the might of Imperial Japan and the surprised forces of the United Kingdom and the United States.&#10;&#10;Zero! includes the important early-war fighters and bomber of the Imperial Japanese Navy and Army, Royal Air Force, United States Navy, United States Army Air Force, and the American Volunteer Group (the famous Flying Tigers). Fly the fearsome A6M2 Zero against the F4F Wildcat, Hawker Hurricane IIb, Curtiss P-40B and E Tomahawks, and the ill-fated Brewster Buffalo. As a pilot with the Japanese Army, take Ki-27 Nates and Ki-43 Oscars to the skies against the Allies over Malaya and Burma. Match your skills with American aces Wagner, Thach, McCuskey or their semi-mercenary countrymen of the AVG, Hill and Newkirk. The Japanese can counter with Sakai, Anabuki, Kato, and more.&#10;&#10;As with the previous games in the series, Zero! includes the Campaigns covering the major aerial events of the December 1941 to June 1942 period. Each consists of multiple missions aimed at a variety of targets, for which you must wisely allocate your resources of men and material. New to Zero! are Carrier Campaigns, which give players some control over the carrier groups their naval squadrons fly from. Do you go all out for a decisive strike or hold your fighters back and let the enemy overextend himself? Campaigns included in this volume are: Pearl Harbor (solitaire), the Philippines, Malaya, Burma, Coral Sea, and Midway.&#10;&#10;Both Down in Flames veterans and newcomers to the series will enjoy this latest volume. All the components needed to play are included - ownership of the first two volumes is not necessary, but the three games are completely compatible. Beautiful, newly-designed, full-color action cards drive gameplay, while cards representing the major aircraft of the period and counters of the famous aces allow players to explore a wide range of scenarios. Besides the new Carrier Campaigns, historically significant missions have been added to the standard campaigns and the rules have been updated and expanded.&#10;&#10;Are you ready to relive history? Can you sweep the skies in the cockpit of the Zero, delaying or even stopping the appearance of American industrial might?

2248;Leverage;"Leverage is an exciting board game of strategy with a unique action feature; it includes various weighted pieces and is built around universal laws of balance and force. Leverage has been hailed as a favorite of GAMES MAGAZINE in 4 different years.&#10;&#10;Rules and game pieces are simple and easy to understand, yet tactics and strategy can be as sophisticated and challenging as the players themselves. Two opposing strategies (speed &amp; sacrifice vs. conservation &amp; mass force) provide intrigue and depth, as either may be merged into the other as the game unfolds.&#10;&#10;Constant action potential -- Jump, capture, sacrifice, block; and, the players may rock the board at any time to see how the leverage advantage is changing.&#10;&#10;Suspense -- The board always stabilizes at a level position until a move is made that tilts it down to rest at one end; there is no halfway tilt!  When the board tilts down, scoring pegs are removed until it returns to level.&#10;&#10;The winner is (1)the one who tilts the board down towards his opponent when the opponent has no scoring pegs left to remove, or (2)the one who moves all of his remaining playing pieces into the opposite Safety Zone while having more or an equal number of scoring pegs than his opponent.&#10;&#10;";1977;6.25;1.7895
2249;The Sinking of the Titanic;"The Titanic is sinking. Players must race around and rescue passengers from their state rooms and rush to the lifeboats before the ship sinks. After the ship sinks, you must get enough of food and water by visiting islands and/or drawing cards to stay alive until the rescue boat appears and the first one to make it there wins the game. The other lifeboats and all the other passengers in them are lost, leaving only the one victor and his passengers who are saved.&#10;&#10;";1975;6.22539;1.3333
2250;Midway;"The basic idea is each player has his or her own map of the area (in this case the Midway Island) behind a screen. Each player &quot;searches&quot; for the enemy fleet by flying search planes to the various zones on the map and calling the zone co-ordinates. Once found, bombers can be sent in to sink the enemy fleet. The actual attack is fought on a separate battle board where the ships are first placed on a rectangular grid and the attacking planes are placed in adjacent rectangles or on top of the ships themselves to indicate which ship they are attacking.&#10;&#10;The basic game is very simple, but there are a number of additional rules which add realism and complexity: CAP fighters, surface actions, anvil and wave attacks, etc.&#10;&#10;The game is superior with a neutral referee for true double blind play.&#10;&#10;Developed with the technical aid of C. Wade McClusky, Rear Admiral U.S.N. (Ret.)&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill Complexity Rating: 3&#10;Counters: 219 excluding blank counters.&#10;&#10;";1964;6.64792;2.4364
2251;Strat-O-Matic Baseball;"An iconic major league baseball game that is so well known that it is exhibited in the National Baseball Hall of Fame. The game is conducted with pitcher and batter cards constructed with statistical probabilities so they realistically reproduce the real-life performance of each player for the season represented.  The gamer is placed in the role of the manager and/or general manager of a team and controls the batting order, the choice of a starting pitcher, game strategies (hit and run, steals, intentional walks, bunting, positioning of infielders, pinch hitters, defensive substitutions, pitching changes, etc.).  If a full season is played, the game produces amazingly realistic statistics at the player, team, and league levels.  The game comes in two versions: a cards and dice version that has been around since 1962 and a computer version that automatically looks up play outcomes and compiles player, team and league statistics.  Every year, Strat-O-Matic releases new player card sets based on the previous baseball season, seasons past, and some &quot;greats&quot; collections.&#10;&#10;";1962;7.84819;2.3853
2252;King of the Tabletop;"Each player controls a kingdom made up of land tiles of different terrains (mountains, forest, etc), castles, settlements, and people and creatures.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to have a certain amount of prestige, judged by the size of one's kingdom, treasury, and the number of special heroic characters inhabiting the kingdom, as well as possession of a Grand Muniment (very large castle).&#10;&#10;This game was originally published in Dragon #77. Clarifications appeared in Dragon #78, along with an additional rules clarification in the &quot;Out On a Limb&quot; column in Dragon #81.&#10;&#10;";1983;6.91159;1.9231
2253;Touring;"Touring is a card game with the theme of an automobile trip. Players are competing to be the first one to complete a prescribed set of mileage cards. In all versions of the game you need 16 mileage cards to win. From lowest to highest value cards, the required counts are 8, 4, 2 and 2. Other players will try to slow you down by playing cards against you which cause you to lose mileage cards, or to play &quot;problem&quot; cards which you must remove by playing a corresponding &quot;remedy&quot; card.&#10;&#10;The game can be played in partnership for the 4- and 6-player versions, with each partnership playing as a single driver.&#10;&#10;Touring was originally published in 1906 by the Touring Card Company, then sold by Wallie Dorr, and then later picked up by Parker Brothers in 1924. Winning Moves Games currently (2015) holds the trademark for and publishes Touring.  If the mechanics sound familiar, it is the inspiration for the game Mille Bornes, which has since become more popular.&#10;&#10;As driving technology improved, card names and depicted mileage values became outdated and were thus replaced with longer distances.  There are multiple sets of rules, which reflect these changes.  A recent edition added some card categories.&#10;&#10;The action card types are different between Touring and Mille Bornes. For example, Mille Bornes adds the &quot;protective&quot; cards, e.g. Emergency Vehicle which allows you to ignore speed limits. Thus in Mille Bornes a player has more decisions to make.&#10;&#10;See also:&#10;&#10;     The Lindy Flying Game - A 1927 Nucraft Toys version of Touring based on Charles Lindbergh's flight across the Atlantic.  &#10;     Lindy, the New Flying Game - 1927 Parker Brothers sequel where Touring card play has been themed on Charles Lindbergh's flight across the Atlantic.&#10;     Mille Bornes - A similar game to Touring, first published in 1954.&#10;     Wings: The Air Mail Game - Another &quot;flying&quot; game like Lindy, but card deck split into two parts with different colors.&#10;     Stap op - The Dutch adaptation (bikes!) of the classic game Touring, from 1950 and still published today.&#10;&#10;&#10;Stap op is the Dutch adaptation (bikes!) of the classic American game Touring (cars!).&#10;&#10;";1906;5.24024;1.2105

Different card strategies can be employed to influence each bout as well.

The game supports solitaire play.&#10;&#10;";1979;6.76113;2.1707
2255;Kartenschach;"Kartenschach is proposed as 16 Chess games in 1. They are all variations on Chess using cards to augment the game. All are for 2 players. Many of the games are pure strategy with no randomness, just like Chess itself; many of them have an element of luck; and many of them introduce other game elements into Chess, including bluffing, hand management, resource management, gambling, push-your-luck, trick-taking, auctions, etc. There is something here for everyone--including the serious Chess player.&#10;&#10;In every game, a player's possible moves are determined, to varying extents, by the cards available to that player. Sometimes, a king will appear to be threatened, but will actually be safe, if the attacking piece is unable to move. As such, check and checkmate have been removed from these games entirely; a player may willingly enter or stay &quot;in check.&quot; The goal of every game is simply to capture the opposing king.&#10;&#10;";2000;6.78462;2.0
2256;The Magnificent Race;"Fun game where 2-4 players use various means of travel to win the race. You buy cards to gain advantages in the mini races on certain types of modes of travel. The races are conducted with marbles in a spinning roulette style wheel with only one hole. The marble that lands in the hole wins that race and moves 3 pegs along the  race track from NY around the world to NY. Beware of the purple marble though. He is the non player Dastardly Dan and he is in every race and may indeed win the game!&#10;&#10;This game bears a very vague resemblance to Wacky Races and may have been inspired by the cartoon, though one is not a reprint of the other.&#10;&#10;A complete game appears to consist of the following: &#10;&bull; A Magnificent Race spinner &bull; A deck of 24 Advantage cards &bull; 4 Vehicle cards &bull; 4 Arrow Markers &bull; 20 Racing marbles - 5 of Each Color &bull; A &quot;Dastardly Dan&quot; purple Marble &bull; Play money (30 bills each of $5000 and $10,000) &bull; A Progress Peg Chart &bull; 5 Pegs &bull; 1 Die &bull; A Race Track Playing Board&#10;&#10;";1975;6.30984;1.1622

2259;Afrika Korps;"Afrika Korps is an easy and fun historical game of  Rommel&rsquo;s battles with the English in North Africa during WW2. One of the early Avalon Hill beginner war games.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;Ever since men began making weapons they have used them to create legends: in early 1941, when his conquest of Europe was embarrassed by the rout of his Italian allies in Africa, Hitler dispatched General Erwin Rommel to forestall a seemingly inevitable Axis defeat. Reorganizing the forces under his command as the Deutsches Afrika Korps (DAK), Rommel immediately launched the first of his legendary desert offensives.&#10;&#10;Now, the legend of &quot;The Desert Fox&quot; is recreated. From April 1941 through the climatic battle at El Alamein in later 1942. Afrika Korps simulates the mobile conflict between Rommel's Panzerarmee Afrika and the British Eighth Army defending Egypt and the Suez Canal. During each monthly game-turn, the initiative may switch from the Germany to the Allied player as both come to understand why Rommel called North Africa &quot;A tactician's paradise; a logistical officer's nightmare.&quot;&#10;&#10;A 2 on Avalon Hill's complexity scale of 1(low) to 10(high).

Your pieces start nested off the board. On a turn, you either play one exposed piece from your three off-the-board piles or move one piece on the board to any other spot on the board where it fits. A larger piece can cover any smaller piece. A piece being played from off the board may not cover an opponent's piece unless it's in a location where your opponent threatens to win with 3 pieces in a row.&#10;&#10;Your memory is tested as you try to remember whose piece one of your larger pieces is covering before you move it. As soon as a player has four pieces in a row, s/he wins &mdash; except in one case: If you lift your piece and reveal an opponent's piece that completes a four-in-a-row, you don't immediately lose; you can't return the piece to its starting location, but if you can place it over one of the opponent's three other pieces in that line, the game continues.&#10;&#10;_______________&#10;Similiar to : &#10;&#10;     Cover Up&#10;&#10;&#10;";2000;6.61923;1.8361

2270;Borderlands;"In Borderlands, each player runs a kingdom. The kingdoms are grown by adding new lands to the capital and new creatures to the lands. As each kingdom grows, it becomes more powerful -- but it also becomes more vulnerable as its borderlands grow as well.&#10;&#10;Each turn, land and creature &amp; feature cards are drawn. Power cards, Gold, Food, and Resources are gathered from the lands. Armies are deployed to opposing kingdoms, capturing new lands from their borderlands.&#10;&#10;Ultimately, one player will save up enough power cards to create an artifact for his kingdom. If this artifact is brought back to the capital, the player wins.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.22222;3.0
2271;Creeper;"Selection #4 of The Games Collection by Pin International.&#10;&#10;Creeper is an abstract strategy game which belongs in the same family as Hex/Twixt. That is, two players attempt to link two sides of the board with a chain of pieces.&#10;&#10;Players: 2 only. One plays black, the other white.&#10;The Bits:&#10;&#10;     16 pawns, 8 black and 8 white.&#10;     32 &quot;Othello&quot; disks, i.e. black one side and white on the other.&#10;     A board made up of a 6&times;6 square grid of octagons. &#10;&#10;&#10;The game: Although the spaces on the board are octagonal, the main playing pieces ( the pawns ) are placed and played in the squares that are formed where the corners of the octagons meet.&#10;On his/her turn, the player may move one of their 8 pawns.&#10;A move may consist of leaping diagonally over an octagon, or a simple move between one octagon and the next in a straight line, or finally a pawn may capture an opponents` pawn by jumping over it a la checkers/draughts.&#10;&#10;In the first case, if a pawn makes the diagonal jump one of two actions may take place: if the octagon is empty, one of the disks is played inside it, with the players` colour uppermost. Alternatively, if the octagon is occupied by an opponents` disk, this disk is flipped over to show the opposite side (and therefore colour). &#10;The winner is the first player to link two specific diagonally opposed corners ( black must link top left to bottom right and white top right to bottom left), with a continuous chain of their colour disks. Only orthogonal links count, not diagonal.&#10;&#10;&#10;";1995;6.53281;1.875
2272;Aggravation;"Players move their four pieces around the board from Start to Home.  Lucky die rollers can make use of the shortcut spaces to speed movement.  However, players can not pass their own pieces and landing on any one else's piece sends the landed-on piece back to the Base where it must start again.  First player to get all four pieces Home wins.&#10;&#10;";1962;4.92176;1.198
2273;Hopfen & Malz;"This db spiele game can be translated to &quot;Hops and Malt&quot; in English.  The goal of the game is to brew the best beer using ingredients associated with the German purity law:  Malt, hops, and water.  There is a card deck associated with each of these 3 ingredients:  a malt deck, a hops deck and a water deck.  Players have a limited amount of money to purchase ingredients for their beer.  Ingredients in each deck are valued from 1 (worst ingredients) to 6 (best ingredients).  The decks are shuffled separately and the 3 decks are placed face down in the table.  The top card of each deck is turned over.  In turn, each player may buy any of the 3 ingredients with their money.  This continues until all the ingredients are gone or the players run out of money.  Now, players sell their beer at market.  To make beer, you must have 1 hop card + 1 malt card + 1 water card.  The value of the beer is the sum of the value of the cards.  Contracts valued between 10 and 100 are turned over 1 at a time.  Players use once around bidding with their beer to buy the best contracts.  The total value of the contracts purchased determines the winning player.&#10;&#10;";1992;5.5;0.0
2275;Airlines;"Airlines, The Game of Airline Strategy (a.k.a. Airline Operations in the Age of Deregulation) is a game of airline operations and business in the 1990's. Players represent the Chief Operations and Marketing Officers of major American airlines, whose job is to fly the most passengers over a given period of time.&#10;&#10;There are two basic games in Airlines: the One-Year Quick Game which takes about 45 minutes to play and the Three-Year Game, which takes about two hours to play. The currency of the game is seats, seats are used to pay for everything. The game is card-based, with a small map to show distances between Major and Regional Airports. The cards consist of Major Airports, Regional Airports, various Aircrafts, airline Hubs (your airline), Gates, and varied Opportunity/Events cards. The Ops/Events cards may denote bad weather in a region (thus reducing number of seats for that round), strikes (which can played on another airline), Fuel Price Adjustments (which effect your maintenance fees paid with Seats), and even an Aircraft Incident card (which people outside the industry call &quot;crashes.&quot;)&#10;&#10;Airlines can be combined with the stand-alone game Airlines: United States Set 2.&#10;&#10;";1998;4.68243;2.0556
2277;Lose Your Shirt;"Fortunes change at a stroke in this exciting game of betting and bluffing! Play your cards right and you'll be on a winning streak --but give too much away and you'll find your opponent's horse piping you at the post. Tension's high from the instant the horses leave their starting stalls. You keep the horse you've backed secret until you judge the moment's right to reveal it --cunning players will push other horses forward to create a &quot;false scent&quot;, then try to come through the field with a last minute burst and take the race at the winning post. If you back for a place, you play safe...But the stakes will be low. If you try for a big win...You could lose your shirt! This exciting race game keeps everyone guessing --and trying-- till the very last moment, and whether you win or lose it will provide hours of fascinating family fun.&#10;&#10;Contents: Felt playing area, 42 horse movement cards, 12 betting indicator cards, money, six plastic horses in different colors, starting stalls and grandstand. In the Canadian edition, the felt became a standard board, and the starting stalls and grandstand are gone as they were just chrome (theme elements not employed in the game).&#10;&#10;For each of the eight races the cards are thoroughly shuffled and dealt out to each player. The different cards (5 per horse) advance each horse at various rates (2 to 4 spaces) in the race and there are also 12 cards that affect any horse in the race (backwards 2 or forward 3). Players secretly bet on a horse to either win or place (take first or second place); you can also bet the jackpot (which is made up of all losing bets from previous races), which is like betting for a win except the minimum stake is higher and the payout is handled differently. Betting on a horse actually means taking one of its movement cards out...until you decide to play it, revealing your bet --one of this game's numerous subtleties.&#10;&#10;During the race, the players play their horse cards in turn, maneuvering the horses as needed --horses have very limited sidestepping and could be blocked during the race. If a player &quot;loses his shirt&quot; i.e. goes broke, he just continues the game playing cards but not betting.&#10;&#10;It can be best described as a cross between Win, Place &amp; Show and Undercover (a.k.a. Heimlich &amp; Co.).&#10;&#10;";1976;6.61075;1.4286

2281;Pictionary;"Playing Pictionary may remind you of Charades, but with drawing on paper instead of acting out the answers.  In Pictionary, though, both teams' (or even all three teams') clue givers may be drawing at the same time as players strive to be the first to guess the correct answer.  When the answer is not designated &quot;All Play,&quot; one team simply tries to come up with the answer before the timer runs out, which is usually but not always possible thanks to the varying difficulty levels of the answers.  No great drawing talent is required; instead, players gain an edge if they have a good imagination when guessing, empathy for their team mates, and/or a general ability to communicate in restricted circumstances.  A board is provided, just to keep score on, which focuses the competition.  Pictionary was a big hit when it first appeared and has been a classic on the party game scene ever since.&#10;&#10;";1985;5.84284;1.2254

A whole bunch of four-squares bases shaped like lightning bolts come in three colours and represent the cool (white), temperate (green) and hot (yellow) continents.  Each of these bases can hold an animal.  The bases and animals are deployed semi-randomly at the game outset by all players (this could need to be better constrained by the rules as the set-up has considerable consequences on the game's outcome); the restriction is that each continent must form a single land mass.  Although the bases come in three heights, this is ignored in the rules.&#10;&#10;The animals are colour-coded at their bases to indicate on which continent they belong.  They all come in pairs.  Some animals are predators, with a red background.  You must deploy them so as to split the pairs.  Your little boat has room for two animals on board.  You cannot carry a predator and a prey at once, but all other combinations are OK.&#10;&#10;You roll a six-sided die to move; on a one, a continent base sinks (is removed) instead; you do not move.  The flooded base cannot have an animal on it, so if there are no floodable bases, you reroll.  Otherwise, you must use the exact die roll to move with --diagonals aren't allowed.  Once beside a continent, the die roll is used to send an &quot;expedition&quot; to catch an animal, which again must be reached by exact count.  If the trail goes through another animal  as well, you have the option of capturing it too.  You go back to your two &quot;berth&quot; spaces beside the Ark to drop the animals off --this also gets you a free second move.&#10;&#10;Once the last animal is removed from the land, the game ends instantly.  All animals in transit (on board players' boats) are discarded and those in the Ark are scored.  Prey are worth one, predators two.  A pair of animals doubles in worth.  If you have animals from each of the three continents, your score doubles.&#10;&#10;As the Ark hides the animals dropped in its compartments, there is an element of memory involved --you should try to remember what each player has brought back so far to have an idea of who's in the lead.&#10;&#10;The movement system is annoying because diagonals aren't allowed (so parity conservation is enforced) and actually makes the game drag a bit at the end; it'd suggest playing that exact rolls aren't required --or that diagonals are allowed.&#10;&#10;";1986;4.6;2.0
2310;Cash;"Players, taking on the personas of thieves, start with empty hands. On each turn, a player may draw a key card (keys come in four colors) or play one or more combinations of four appropriately colored key cards to open some of the 35 available safes (only seven safes and their contents are revealed and available each round) to collect cash. Players receive a bonus for opening the seventh and final safe each round, and also for cracking two or more safes in a single turn. When all 35 safes (five rounds) have been collected, the player with the most cash wins.&#10;&#10;";1990;5.82946;1.2857
2311;Wild Life;"Not to be confused with Ravensburger's famous Wildlife Adventure game, although there are some similarities. Both come in the same (very) large-box format, and in Wild Life, much as in Wildlife Adventure, players travel about a large world map seeking to visit the habitats of rare and exotic animals.&#10;&#10;With a box description reading &quot;An ecology game that fosters wild animal conservation&quot; and &quot;The game of world-wide travel to search for, trade, and collect wild and rare animals to fill a winning zoo,&quot; Wild Life is primary a roll-and-move game where players circle a set map with various stops, at which they might collect Harbor, Transport, or &quot;Serata&quot; cards (which may help or hinder your progress similar to the cards in Monopoly) or collect, trade, and sell various animal cards in an attempt to collect the specific sets needed to fill the specific &quot;zoo&quot; each player chose at the beginning of the game. The first player to collect all the cards needed to fill their chosen zoo wins the game.&#10;&#10;Interestingly, although the game says it can support up to five players, if there is a fifth player that person actually only acts as the game's banker and does not actually participate in the game otherwise.&#10;&#10;The game is asymmetrical; each zoo has its own strengths and weaknesses and favour different strategies.&#10;&#10;Note that there are several different versions of the game with varying mechanics, some of which have much more strategy than others; see the community wiki for details.&#10;&#10;";1964;5.45217;1.4583
2312;Ringgeister;"Game based on J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. Played on a randomly assembled board composed of 12 octagonal and 11 square pieces, with one corner representing the hobbits' home and the other Mt. Doom. Players race to complete several lesser quests before being allowed to cast the One Ring into the fires of Mt. Doom, all while avoiding ringwraith, orc and Gollum tokens or moving Gandalf to help. Unlike the newer, much-heralded The Lord of the Rings game, this is not a cooperative quest, although all players do lose if a ringbearer is caught by a ringwraith.&#10;&#10;";1992;5.01051;2.0714
2314;Off to the Tower;"A small-box children's game with interlocking gameboard pieces. Players race to stay ahead of each other, and if caught are sent &quot;off to the Tower&quot; where only a roll of 6 will free them.&#10;&#10;";1978;5.17452;1.0
2315;Saratoga: 1777 â Burgoyne vs Gates;"Recreate the Battle of Saratoga in the American Revolution (1777). The American victory led to French support and a turning of the tide of the war in the North. One side is the British, the other side, the Americans. Movement is from linked town to town along a road or river, rather than hex movement. In this light, asymmetrical wargame there are rules for entrenching, fortifications, and supply, as well as optional rules with combat odds and percentage losses. Victory conditions differ depending on the side.&#10;&#10;";1974;5.435;2.5714
2316;X-Bugs;"The History:&#10;In the famous Roswell crash, the alien crew died, but some alien insects survived... and at the moment they're ready to conquer the world!&#10;But during the cold war, US and Soviet scientists studied a solution: genetically modified earth insects, strong enough to deal with the menace!&#10;The battle is going to begin!&#10;&#10;The Game:&#10;the game is based on the classic tiddlywinks: every army has three &quot;bases&quot; which have to be defended, and various &quot;soldier insects&quot; (winks) with various shapes, dimensions, and special abilities.&#10;An &quot;insect&quot; is captured when an opponent &quot;insect&quot; stop over it. A &quot;base&quot; is captured the second time an opponent &quot;insect&quot; stop over it.&#10;Three 6-sided creature dice for every army are rolled every turn, and dictates which kinds of insects can move. When you lose a base, you lose a die and therefore some mobility. When you lose the second base, you're out of the game.&#10;&#10;There are six armies, but only four were published in the United States. The game is sold in boxes containing two armies, and each army is separately available in two colors so identical forces can face each other:&#10;- USArthropods Vs. Flyborgs&#10;- Sovietoptera Vs. Chitinians&#10;- Samurachnids Vs. Bifids (not published in the US as of 8/2007)&#10;&#10;Each set has enough pieces for two players; by combining sets up to 12 can play.&#10;&#10;About special abilities: some insects can mimetize, some can move twice, other can shoot some weapons like missiles or acid spits (represented by winks, too)...&#10;&#10;BTW, the Italian name for &quot;Tiddlywinks&quot; is &quot;il gioco della pulce&quot;, which means &quot;the game of the flea&quot;.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented as Micro Mutants: Evolution&#10;&#10;";2001;6.33709;1.3433
2317;MÃ¼ckenstich;"M&uuml;ckenstich is a trick-taking card game with four suits, with each suit having cards numbered 1-12 (with two 12s) and three mosquitoes; a mosquito has no number but is the highest card in a suit.&#10;&#10;Each round, players start with a number of cards in hand, then discard two of those cards face down. For the most part, M&uuml;ckenstich follows traditional trick-taking rules. The active player lays down a card, then each other player follows by playing a single card, following suit, if possible. Whenever a mosquito is played, that player declares one color to be trump. (The game starts with no trump color.) A mosquito or 12 played later in the round is considered higher than one played earlier. Once all players have laid down a card, the highest trump card (if any) wins the trick; with no trump, the highest card in the suit led for the round wins the trick. Players keep track of tricks won, and the winner of a trick leads to the next trick.&#10;&#10;Once all tricks have been played, the single player with the fewest tricks names one suit to count double during scoring, then the single player with the most mosquitoes names one of the three remaining suits to be worthless. Then players tally their points: The first mosquito in a suit is worth -5 points, while all other mosquitos are worth 0. Suited cards are worth 0-2 depending on whether they are worthless, scored as normal, or doubled.&#10;&#10;After a number of rounds equal to the number of players (or twice as many rounds with three players), the player with the highest total score wins.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.71575;1.8
2318;Scrabble Junior;"This is a version of Scrabble for players aged 5-12 featuring a double-sided board. The introductory version resembles more a crossword puzzle in which all the possible words have already been spelled out. This is an aid to learning about spelling. Points are earned by completing words. The reverse side is an entirely blank grid [1], leaving players to come up with their own words. A point is earned for each letter placed. Letters are formed from cardboard tiles and do not have values.&#10;&#10;Originated in 1958 by the Production &amp; Marketing Company who followed it in a second edition in 1964. Third edition by Selchow &amp; Righter appeared 1968.

The dealer decides how many this is, from 3 to 8, and can change from one hand to the next. The more cards that you deal, the more challenging the play. If, for example, the dealer deals 5 cards, then only words with 5 letters can be made. &#10;Each letter in that word is then worth a certain number of points, giving you a score for that hand. &#10;The first player to reach a pre-determined score wins.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.41935;1.3333

In Monotony, the goal of each Homemaker is to acquire more items (Dust Balls, Grocery Sacks, Husbands, Kids and Pets) than any of the opponents.  Successful Homemakers may qualify during the game to wear the sacred Spoon-Through-the-Head!  The rules are a riot to read.&#10;&#10;";1984;5.0;2.0
2326;Pirate and Traveler;"From the 1936 Edition Rules:&#10;&#10;&quot;This is a Game of Travel, concluding with a Pirate fight.  It comprises a Game-Board, Travel-Cards, Four Travelers, and Spinner.  The Game-Board is a Map of the World.  The Travel-Cards indicate journeys to be made by the Travelers, and the distance to be traveled in each move is determined by spinning.  As the routes of travel are well-known railroad and steamship lines, the players acquire a knowledge of these, also the chief cities and ports and their principal articles of commerce...&quot;&#10;&#10;The game was first published by Milton Bradley in 1911.  Other known dates of publication include 1936, 1953, 1956, 1960 and (finally?) 1970.  The game was also published in Great Britain by Chad Valley in the 1960's.  Details of the world map, travel cards, etc. vary between editions.&#10;&#10;";1908;5.41818;1.2857
2328;Starunner;"Starunner takes place in a balkanised galaxy; the Galaxy-wide Empire has fallen, and centuries later small empires have appeared all over.  The re-invented warp (hyperdrive) technology is crude and a little hazardous.  Power crystals are relics of the fallen empire, still impossible to create anew, and can be integrated into the engines and computer systems of the ships to make them much, much better performing.&#10;&#10;You are a power crystal smuggler, or Star Runner.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to be the first to smuggle six power crystals to the Para system.  As the locations of the crystals are unknown at the outset, you'll first need to accumulate Clues.  For every six clues, you find a crystal --that is, you roll to deploy one; although you're the only one who knows where it is, you still need to get there and back...&#10;&#10;There are three basic strategies: One At A Time, where you find and fetch each of the six crystals in sequence; All At Once, where you locate all six before attempting to retrieve them; and Piracy, where you lie in wait of those who have found crystals...&#10;&#10;";1985;4.0;3.0
2329;Energy Quest;"In Energy Quest, each player is the president of an energy corporation, developing energy sources so as to sell the output.  Two basic types of property are on the board: raw materials (coal, oil, etc.) and power sites, where energy can be produced (electric stations and the like).  World Oil Price will rise steadily if unpredictably as the game progresses, making some propositions profitable in the later stages.&#10;&#10;There are two sets of currency: dollars and kilowatt-hours (kWh).  You buy energy from a player when you land on his developed power site, but the real victory condition is accumulating kWh &quot;receipts&quot; whenever you land on your won power sites or pass &quot;Take Off&quot; (e.g. &quot;Go&quot;).  Money and property are not counted at the end, so you must gauge carefully how much money to invest in kWh receipts as the game goes on.&#10;&#10;";1977;5.5;0.0
2330;Medical Monopoly;"In Medical Monopoly, each player is a doctor with a hospital to run.  If you are successful in having the right supplies (medicines, organs, etc.) on hand and in diagnosing illnesses, your hospital fills up --the first player to fill his hospital with patients wins.&#10;&#10;Oddly enough, this victory condition isn't clearly stated in the rules.  The game has elements of a Trivia game to it, as you must often recognize an illness from a list of symptoms and remember the appropriate cure (if any).  This lowers the replay value somewhat, but the game does have an educational vocation, so this is excusable.&#10;&#10;";1979;4.83333;1.0
2331;Spill and Spell;"Spill and Spell was originally published by Phillips. Parker Bros. also published this game.&#10;&#10;It is a word dice game where players make words to score points. Scoring is determined by squaring the number of letters in the words spelled (e.g. making a 3 letter word and a 4 letter word would net 25 (9+16)) and subtracting the square of unused letters.&#10;&#10;The 2003 Endless Games edition includes 22 letter cubes and is scored differently, assigning a point value to each letter based upon the length of the word it is part of, with crossed words scoring the shared letter twice, possibly with two different values.&#10;&#10;";1956;5.25842;1.2632

2335;Rome & Carthage;"Rome &amp; Carthage is a wargame set around the Mediterranean Sea. Each player controls one of four empires based in the cities Rome, Carthage, Constantinople, and Alexandria, and your goal is to occupy the other capitals and destroy your opponents' pieces on both land and sea.&#10;&#10;Each player controls different armies consisting of footmen, cavalry, elephants and galleys, each of which has different movement rules. In combat, each player plays two cards from his hand, with cards coming from a standard 52-card deck. Different units have different powers; the elephant, for example, doubles a player's highest card while the cavalry doubles his lowest one. Certain combinations of cards allow for special actions, such as seeing what your opponent plays before laying down your own cards.&#10;&#10;";1954;6.35994;2.0476

2338;Starship Catan;"Starship Catan is a two-player card game that is thematically similar to Starfarers of Catan, but has different game play.  Players explore randomly shuffled decks of cards looking for potential colonies, good trading deals, opportunities to help planets, and either avoid or combat pirates.  Players can upgrade their ships' systems, including weapons to combat the pirates, thrusters to be able to explore further each turn, scanners to see (and avoid) cards that are coming up, and several others.  Victory points are earned by establishing colonies, building upgraded ship's systems, having the most friendship points, and having the most hero points.

2342;Mystery Mansion;"Mystery Mansion is a unique search game that challenges you to build a Victorian Mansion, room by room, as you search these rooms for hidden treasure.  Build the mansion by adding new rooms onto existing rooms with the roll of a special die.  Every room contains many objects which are all possible hiding places for clues to the whereabouts of the Real Treasure.  Search cards allow you to look behind, under and inside these objects for clues.  Try to add rooms that you suspect contain objects that match Search cards in your hand.  If you have a Search card that matches an object in the same room as your pawn, play it and draw a Clue card.  The clue might be a Treasure Chest, a Key to a chest, a Secret Passage or just Cobwebs and Dust.  If you own a key that matches a chest, haul the chest out of the mansion to unlock it.  Once it's outside, the big moment comes as you open the lid.  Will it be filled with gold and jewels or cobwebs and dust?&#10;&#10;";1984;6.14958;1.8261
2343;Electronic Talking Mystery Mansion;"While this may have intended to be just an electronic update of the earlier Milton Bradley game, Electronic Talking Mystery Mansion ends up being a very different game.  Instead of a modular board, the board is fixed but the content of the rooms is variable.  Gone is the need to collect the right Search cards.  Instead players can search any item they like.  The electronic organizer tells the players what clues they find.  Some information is given to everyone, other information is just given to the active player.  Players deduce the location of the money based on the clues they find, and have to collect the correct clue cards (one item, one person) out of the 12 possible in order to obtain the money and win the game.  &#10;   The changes from the earlier board game: no search cards, no chests to drag out of the house, fewer hiding spots, and fewer clue cards, makes this version play much quicker and feel quite a bit lighter.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.43554;1.4

2345;Groo: The Game â Expansion Set;"This expansion set for Groo: The Game adds 55 cards to the 60 cards that came with the initial deck.  The new cards allow the game to go to 6 players instead of the 4 proposed by the base game.&#10;&#10;The expansion adds no new card types, but doubling the number of available cards makes the game much easier to play.  In the original game, especially with 4 players, the late game could sometimes stall as there weren't enough resources for the players to drive to a win.  The additional cards prevent this stall and add many options to the game.  They also bring in almost every iconic Groo character, event, and location.&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;    Groo: The Game&#10;&#10;&#10;";1997;6.72103;1.5152
2346;DVONN;"DVONN is played on an elongated hexagonal board, with 23 white, 23 black and 3 red DVONN-pieces. In the beginning the board is empty. The players place the pieces on empty spaces of the board, without restrictions. They place the DVONN-pieces first and their own pieces next. Then they start stacking pieces on top of each other. A single piece may be moved 1 space in any direction, a stack of two pieces may be moved two spaces, etc. A stack must always be moved as a whole and a move must always end on top of another piece or stack. If pieces or stacks lose contact with the DVONN-pieces, they must be removed from the board. The game ends when no more moves can be made. The players put the stacks they control on top of each other and the one with the highest stack is the winner.&#10;&#10;This game is part of project GIPF.&#10;&#10;";2001;7.44007;2.6532

Pieces move a number of spaces equal to the number of other pieces they are stacked on. Only the piece on the top of a stack may move. There are two entrances onto the game track, but only one route leading  to the finish area. The track contains a &quot;trampoline&quot; space which allows a player to double the  distance of a move when landing on this spot.  The first player to remove all of his pieces wins.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.37523;1.5
2349;Inspector Higgins;"One player plays Kommissaris Speurneus/Inspector Higgins with the goal of capturing the thief carrying the treasure and as many other thieves as possible. The remaining players play cooperatively, in turn moving any of the five thief figures as they choose. The thieves' goal is to discover which of the nine houses on the game board contains the treasure and return the treasure to the thieves' hideout. Movement is based on die rolls, with the number and type of dice rolled changing depending on the total number of players in the game.&#10;&#10;";1988;5.7459;1.0
2350;Eureka;"Players act as prospectors moving about the game board in search of gold. But even after finding it, the gold is not always safe from bandits and other players, and must be carried back to a player's home base before it is secure. Rafts are available to help cross rivers. Players move their prospectors on a roll of 2-5, but a roll of 1 sends the gold train one step closer to the prospectors' base camp. The game ends when the gold train arrives or the contents of all the mines have been depleted.&#10;&#10;";1988;5.89766;1.4722

2353;Muscat;"Muscat can quickly be described as &quot;advanced rock-paper-scissors,&quot; but is much better than this  may make it sound.  There are 4 different types of items in this version, which are the different kinds of street performers in the marketplaces of Muscat.  The tiles representing the performers are placed in these marketplaces in such a way as to establish local dominance hierarchies, which are resolved by kicking the loser out on the street and promoting the winners to higher-class sections of Muscat.  Eventually, once can reach the Sultan's palace, and when enough performers have everyone scores points according to how high their performers have advanced up the board.&#10;&#10;There is more to it than that, of course.  The performers kicked out on the street want to get their revenge, and they can be placed back on the board or used to take 3 special actions which add a great deal of complexity to the game.  Although there is some randomness (in which tiles you pick when), this is essentially an abstract of the &quot;brain-burner&quot; school, and should be enjoyed by those who like that kind of  game.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Message to the Czar&#10;&#10;&#10;";2001;6.54106;2.381
2354;Scan;"The card deck in Indiscretion, a.k.a. Scan, is the standard four-suited, 52-card deck &ndash; but the back of each card is color-coded to reveal the suit of the card to all players. Any classic card game can be played with this deck, and the published edition of Scan includes several variations for team or individual play with 2-6 players, with the primary game being a trick-taking partnership game for four players in which each team attempts to capture cards that have positive value (spades are +10 points, hearts +5) while avoiding cards with negative value (clubs are -10 points, diamonds -5).&#10;&#10;The Hit-Serie editions from Piatnik got an additional rule booklet with 10 games invented by nowadays famous designers.&#10;&#10;";1987;6.16234;2.0
2355;Last Frontier: The Artifact;"Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;THE ARTIFACT is a space opera using the Last Frontier: The Vesuvius Incident game system (published  by Fat Messiah Games). Three to eight players take over such roles as the Mad Scientist, the Space Pirate Captain, the Phone Company, or a mystery Alien. Because the format is four way blind, and the players are uncertain of each other's motives, the fog of war is a formidable obstacle in this new gaming genre.&#10;&#10;The action takes place on a space warehouse at the edge of an un-navigable region of the Galaxy known as the Coal Sack. The mad scientist in charge of the facility is trying to sell the Artifact, an alien navigational buoy, to  space pirates. The scientist wins if he completes the deal while keeping his illegal activities secret from the Phone Company, who has a couple of agents on board the station somewhere.&#10;&#10;Victory for the Phone Company depends upon who their secret employers are. His agents may be just innocent employees here to fix the phone lines, they may be working for a rival Museum, or they may work for the Government or private agencies.&#10;&#10;The Pirate Captain's motives are more transparent; he needs to get the Artifact by trade, artifice, or force. Even with his overwhelming firepower, this is not easy. One of his men may be a government informant. The Artifact may not be all it seems. Loss of contact with his men may mean they have turned against him, or alien bugs have laid eggs on their disemboweled remains. A clank outside may signal imminent explosive decompression, or just a sailmaker robot on the outside hull doing its job.&#10;&#10;Aliens may or may not be on board; their nature is unknown. The ship's computer may or may not be a sentient character working with its own victory conditions. One's partner may be a trusted companion or a shapeshifting fiend in disguise. The ship's security system, robots, and self-destruct countdown may be puppets for unknown agencies.&#10;&#10;The Artifact is a gripping drama, full of surprises and mayhem. No two games are alike, full of sabotage, sneak suits, bluster, kamikaze aliens, EMP and plasma guns, booby traps, hacking, and the prospect of the space station being blown up bit by bit by pirate cannon. The action never falters until the last lifeboat is away, the final alias revealed, and the last storeroom explored.&#10;&#10;";2001;7.11515;3.6
2356;Scrabble Sentence Cube Game;"Players in turn roll the 21 word cubes, set the timer and form sentences with the words appearing on the tops of the cubes in a crossword puzzle-like fashion (one word may be part of two sentences - one running vertically and one running horizontally). Turns end when the egg timer runs out. Players score 50 points for each sentence of 7 words or more. All other sentences score the square of the number of words in the sentence (i.e. a 4-word sentence scores 4 X 4, or 16 points). A bonus of 50 points is awarded if all 21 cubes are used. Two points are deducted for each unused cube.&#10;&#10;The 1983 version of the game seems to differ in the number of cubes.  The rules on the inside of the box lid still have a 1971 copyright date, but among other differences, they state that the game contains 27 cubes.  Two of the new cubes are marked with stars on all six sides, making them wild.  From the 1983 rules: &quot;When playing a wild cube, a player must state what word it represents, after which it cannot be changed during that turn.&quot;&#10;&#10;The 1988 version has 24 cubes - two of which are the starred wild dice. The box states that this is the 2nd edition of the game from Coleco Games. Selchow &amp; Righter is credited in the directions as a subsidiary of Coleco Industries, Inc.

2360;Sekt oder Selters;"Theme&#10;&quot;Lola's Bar&quot; is very popular and crowded. The way to the counter is long, and everyone else is trying to get there too in order to get the best drinks. Hurrying a little and elbowing your way through the bar is okay, but if you aren't careful and overshoot the mark you're back on the street again.&#10;&#10;Goal&#10;Collecting as many points as possible by winning the most valuable drink cards.&#10;&#10;Game play&#10;The board shows Lola's Bar with a couple of tables, a parcours consisting of several spaces, and the counter. At the counter, you can get sparkling wine (&quot;Sekt&quot;) or soda (&quot;Selters&quot;). To reach the counter, you roll the dice.&#10;On each turn, you roll up to three times and move one of your four pawns the corresponding number of spaces. Pawns have a value of 1-4. For the first roll, you use one die, for the second roll two dice, and for the third roll three dice, and you have to use the same pawn in each of your up to three rolls per turn. In between rolls, you can decide to stop and end your turn. If one of your pawns reaches one of the four counter spaces, you get the top sparkling wine card (sparkling wine cards are stacked face up). &#10;Sparkling wine cards mostly have positive values, some of them show a dot before one or several zeros (.0, .00, .000). The dot means that you use your pawn that reached the counter to determine its value, i.e. if your pawn with value 4 gets the .000 card, it is worth 400 points. The pawn is put on the card and stays there for the rest of the game.&#10;If you roll too high and your pawn passes the counter space, you get served soda, i.e. you draw the top of the face-down soda cards. Soda cards mostly have negative values (-10 to -1000), and there is also a card which bans you from the bar (i.e. your token is removed from the game).&#10;If you land on a special space, you have to use this particular pawn.&#10;There can only be one pawn per space. If you'd land on a space that is already occupied, the other player decides which closest free space (either backwards or forwards) you have to move your pawn to.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player has no pawns left. The player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;";1992;5.83846;1.0
2362;Tower of the Wizard King;"From the back of the box:&#10;&#10;The Wizard King is old and frail.  After eons on the throne, he has made a final journey to survey his realm.  Now he returns for the last time to his Tower, wherin lies the magic that makes one Wizard supreme over all others.  For captured within is the magical Power of Transformation that allows a creature to enter the Tower as one self-- and emerge as another!  An Elf of the Forests may be transformed into an Ogre of the Mountains.  A Warrior from the Plains may become a Skeleton of the Swamps.  Each of these creatures has his own special powers, special strengths-- and special fears.&#10;&#10;The Wizard King sets his foot at the base of the Ramp of Time and prepares to begin his final ascent up the 15 steps to the Tower.  He has but one thought:  Which of his four apprentice Wizards--Terra, Zephyron, Solanos, or Oceanus-- will use the Tower's magic most strategically and prove himself on the field of battle?  For the Wizard who demonstrates the strongest powers and wins the most pennants will succeed him.  The moment the Ancient One steps onto the Tower, the apprentice will become the next Wizard King.&#10;&#10;Word of the Great One's decline has spread throughout the realm.  In minor skirmishes, the four young Wizards have already begun to test their strengths.&#10;&#10;Now YOU can take the part of one of the four and join their battle. Throughout the adventure, you will remain just one of the four apprentice Wizards, but you will periodically transform yourself into any of the eight different creatures.  And in the end, which of you Wizards will prove youself strongest, conquer the most enemies, capture the most castles and pennants-- and ascend the throne in the Tower?  Which of you will become the new Wizard King?&#10;&#10;";1993;5.91027;1.9333
2364;Black Monday;"Black Monday gets its name from the stock market crash of Oct. 19, 1987, and it's a commercial edition of Sid Sackson's game &quot;Card Stock Market&quot; from the book Card Games Around the World, with this game being playable with two standard decks of playing cards.&#10;&#10;The game includes 104 cards, with corporation cards in four colors. Each card shows a monetary value, along with a number of shares. Reveal cards from the deck until you get one card of each color, and use these cards to set the starting price of the shares for each of the four corporations. Deal each player a hand of eight cards, and give each player $20,000 as starting capital.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you can deal in shares (both buying and selling) and change the value of stocks, but you must do all of your dealing either prior to or subsequent to changing stock values. When you deal, you can sell any number of shares you own, earning money from the bank equal to the number of shares sold by the current value of those shares; when you buy, you can lay down at most two cards from your hand, paying money to the bank equal to the number of shares bought by the current value of those shares.&#10;&#10;When you change value, you take one or two cards from your hand and cover a corporation's current value with this new value; corporations have different limits on how much they can be raised or lowered per card play, with some being more stable than others. If you play the highest-valued cards, you can either pump up the value tremendously &mdash; or tank the stock, bringing its value to $0, with all players discarding all shares they own of this stock. (A player can jumpstart the value of this company by playing a new stock value on it, even with the second card played on the same turn.)&#10;&#10;Alternatively, you can skip the dealing and changing actions to discard 1-4 cards from hand. In either case, to end your turn, replenish your hand to eight cards.&#10;&#10;When the deck is exhausted, take all of the discards and all of the stock value cards other than the top one of each corporation and shuffle them together with a &quot;Market Closed&quot; card to form a new deck. Continue play until the &quot;Market Closed&quot; card is drawn, at which point the game ends immediately, and all shares held by players are cashed out at the current stock value. Whoever has the most money wins.&#10;&#10;";1988;5.72214;2.0625
2366;Quinto;"Part of the 3M Bookshelf Series&#10;&#10;Quinto is essentially Scrabble with Numbers. The game begins with each player drawing a &lsquo;hand&rsquo; of five tiles (numbered from 0 to 9). Players then take turns placing their numbered tiles on the board so that the sum&mdash;of row(s) and column(s)&mdash;is equal to a multiple of the &quot;Multile&quot; number (5, 6, 7, 8, or 9) which has been randomly selected for that round. Second, no row can consist of more than five numbers. Finally, if a player places all five of their tiles in a single turn, they must be able to score in at least two directions. Once all the tiles have been placed, players are docked points for any tiles they have not used; highest score wins.&#10;&#10;The red &quot;Multiles&quot; were introduced in the 1968 edition; the previous (1964) edition didn't have those, and is played as if the &quot;5&quot; Multile were always the one drawn.&#10;&#10;";1964;6.11301;1.8261

2371;Extra!;"Schmidt Spiele is releasing a series of tiny dice games, with each game being packaged in a plastic container that doubles as a miniature dice tower. Sid Sackson's Extra!, some changes from the game first seen in Sackson's book A Gamut of Games under the title Solitaire Dice, is one of the &quot;new&quot; titles in this series.&#10;&#10;In Extra! all players play at the same time off the same roll of five dice. Each player divides the dice into two pairs and a lone fifth die. The value of this fifth die is placed in a reject tally chart and one box underneath this number checked. For each pair of dice, the player marks a box next to the sum of these dice (2-12) on a scoresheet.&#10;&#10;Each player can have at most three values on his reject chart; when a player checks off the final box in a column on this chart, he is out of the game. Once all players are out, they tally their points, losing 200 points for each sum row that they start without meeting a certain threshold. For rows marked past the threshold, the player scores positive points, with less common sums being worth more points. The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;";2011;6.42912;1.42

2384;Safe Return Doubtful;"A game simulating Arctic exploration and the race for the North Pole in the years 1845-1910. Players choose an explorer, ship, and crew, and outfit their expedition. Terrain cards take the place of a map, so each expedition encounters variable terrain on their journey north. Once the ice is reached, they proceed on foot or by sled as far as they dare, limited by bad food, weather, crevasses, scurvy, deep snow, and mutiny. Due to the &quot;you against the elements&quot; nature of the expeditions, player interaction is minimized, making for an excellent solitaire game. Three solitaire scenarios are included, as well as the 2 to 5 player competition game that includes disaster card play and newspaper attacks on your opponents.

The boards are placed randomly at the start of the game by both players one at a time, to their own advantage. The game is played in turns with each player's turn having a number of phases. Get the money you earn from your star systems, move your ships and combat, a reaction from your opponent (which has some restrictions), a final move and combat by you, then it is the other players turn.&#10;&#10;The object of the game varies with the board placement, but basically you need to control your opponents Home-World for a number of turns..&#10;&#10;One of GDW&#039;s Series 120 games, a line of introductory wargames spanning various historical eras.  The games in the series had 120 counters and were supposed to be playable in 120 minutes or less, hence the name.&#10;&#10;The game plays quite fast because the rules, while badly referenced (typical of GDW), are quite straight forward (medium simple). You need to get some card and mount the boards, but the boards themselves are nice enough. The counters are standard fare, but have no printing on the back to show disrupted units.&#10;&#10;The system is based on that used in Imperium: Empires in Conflict &#226;&#128;&#147; Worlds in the Balance.&#10;&#10;";1980;6.42944;2.3
2389;Othello;"Trap other pieces between your own to capture them, but be aware that the opponent may do the same. Pieces will change sides (colors) dozens of times. The winner is the one with the most pieces when no more pieces can be played on the board.&#10;&#10;In Hong Kong, an advertising campaign by Texwood for its Apple Jeans involved the use of Othello sets, retitled Ping Guo Qi (Apple Chess). The sucess of the campaign raised the popularity of the game, and Ping Guo Qi or Apple Chess has since become an alternative name for Hei Bai Qi (Black and White Chess), the more traditional name for the game.&#10;&#10;Goro Hasegawa changed Setup of Reversi a bit and renamed it as Othello inspired from Shakespeare's play.&#10;&#10;";1883;6.14576;2.071

2393;Xiangqi;"XiangQi is one of the most played board games in the world. Translated loosely as &quot;elephant game&quot;, the name of XiangQi may have first been recorded in Songs of Chu during the 4th century BC of early China; in the state of Qi during the Warring State Period, the name &quot;XiangQi&quot; meant ivory Liubo pieces, not modern XiangQi played by Chinese. The modern Xiangqi set dates back to the Tang dynasty.&#10;&#10;Based closely on ancient Chinese military strategy, XiangQi draws comparisons to European Chess, and indeed, both are descended from the ancient Indian game of Chaturanga.&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;XiangQi, commonly referred to in English as &quot;Chinese Chess&quot;, is played with 32 pieces (16 per player) on a board that is 9 lines wide and 10 lines long. As in the game of Go, the game is played on the intersections of the game board. The area of play is divided into two territories by a river in the middle of game board. In each territory there is a 3 line by 3 line palace, in which each player's respective General/Marshal is located. The object of the game is to capture the opponents's General/Marshal.&#10;&#10;The pieces on both sides and their movements &amp; special rules are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    1 General: 1 Point orthogonally within the palace only. Not allowed to &lsquo;see&rsquo; the enemy General on an open file.&#10;    2 Advisors: 1 point diagonally within the palace only.&#10;    2 Chariots: Any distance orthogonally.&#10;    2 Cannons: Moves like a Chariot. To capture, it must first leap over an intervening piece of either color.&#10;    2 Horses: 1 point orthogonally, then one point diagonally.&#10;    2 Elephants / Ministers: 2 points diagonally. Cannot cross the river.&#10;    5 Soldiers: 1 point straight forward.  Once across the river, can also move 1 point sideways instead.&#10;&#10;&#10;Pieces capture as they move and never jump. The only exception (for both rules) apply to the cannon.&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;The price of the game varies depending on the material used in the game. Inexpensive sets are usually made with plastic or low-grade wooden pieces and a paper gameboard. Expensive sets are usually made with jade or high-grade wooden pieces and a wooden gameboard.&#10;&#10;Variants&#10;&#10;    Banqi - Game using same pieces&#10;    Giog - Game using same pieces&#10;    Mini Xiang Qi - Smaller version&#10;    San Guo Qi - Three-player version&#10;    Qi Guo Xiang Qi - Seven-player version&#10;    Changgi - Korean version&#10;&#10;&#10;You can play Chinese Chess for free at http://www.xiangqi.com.&#10;&#10;";762;7.09906;3.5539
2394;Dominoes;"A traditional tile game played in many different cultures around the world.  This entry is for Western Dominoes; the standard set being the 28 &quot;Double Six&quot; tiles.  Chinese Dominoes use a 32 tile set with different distributions.&#10;&#10;Dominoes is a family of games using the &quot;Western&quot; style tiles.  The standard set of tiles is based on the 21 different combinations made with a roll of two six-sided dice.  Seven (7) additional &quot;Blank&quot; combination tiles combine with the 21 to form the standard 28 &quot;Double-Six&quot; set. &quot;Double-Nine&quot; (with 55 tiles) and &quot;Double-Twelve&quot; (with 91 tiles) are also popular. &quot;Double-Fifteen&quot; sets with 136 tiles also exist.&#10;&#10;There are many different games played with Dominoes.  The standard game is known as the Block game.  Forms of this game are known in many different areas of the world with similar rules.  Puerto Rican Dominoes, Latin Dominoes, and Cuban Dominoes are all forms of the Block game.&#10;&#10;Another main variety of Dominoes games are based on the &quot;Fives Family&quot;.  Five-up, All Fives, Sniff, and Muggins are all part of this family.  This variation adds the ends of the dominoes to make a multiple of five for scoring.&#10;&#10;Other popular Dominoes games include 42, ChickenFoot, and Mexican Train.&#10;&#10;";1500;5.55245;1.3668

Players have identical sets of 24 tiles. Each tile has a path on it; straights, t's, turns, crosses, and one cap.  They take turns playing a single tile anywhere on the board with the goal of creating a path connecting their two sides of the board.

2396;Ur: 1830 BC;"This game isn't a true 18xx game, in the sense that it's officially sanctioned by Francis Tresham.  However, it shares a good number of characteristics with the 18xx series of games, while still being different enough to be a different game.  The game is about diverting water from rivers into irrigation channels and supplying the life-giving water to sections of land.  In 18xx, there are private companies; in Ur, there are independent nations.  In 18xx, there are companies with shareholders and a majority-controlling president; in Ur, there are countries with landowners and a majority-controlling King.  Once a Kingdom has enough land purchased in it, it begins to build water infrastructure in the form of reservoirs and pumps.  These structures draw the water away from the rivers into irrigation channels which are drawn straight on the board.  Like 18xx, the technology increases as the game progresses, making channel diggers obsolete and bringing out more efficient waterworks.  When a section of land is irrigated, the owner earns a small degree income and the kingdom it's located in earns a much larger income, which can then be given to the landowners or kept in the Kingdom's coffers for future upgrades.  The game is finally over when all the incoming water is used, forcing the southern tribes to invade, or a kingdom cannot fulfill it's obligation to buy more ditch-diggers and falls into revolution.  The player with the largest personal holdings (land and money) is the victor.&#10;&#10;";2001;6.84428;3.8621
2397;Backgammon;"Backgammon is a classic abstract strategy game dating back thousands of years. Each player has a set of 15 checkers (or stones) that must be moved from their starting positions, around, and then off the board. Dice are thrown each turn, and each player must decide which of their checkers to move based on the outcome of the roll. Players can capture each other's checkers, forcing the captured checkers to restart their journey around the board. The winner is the first player to get all 15 checkers off the board. A more recent addition to the game is the &quot;doubling cube&quot;, which allows players to up the stakes of the game. Although the game relies on dice to determine movement, there is a large degree of strategy in deciding how to make the most effective moves given each dice roll and measuring the risk in terms of possible rolls the opponent may get.&#10;&#10;Backgammon may be the first game to be mentioned in written history, going back 5,000 years to the Sumerians of ancient Mesopotamia. During the 1920s, archaeologists unearthed five boards from a cemetery in the ancient town of Ur. At another location, pieces and dice were also found along with the board. Boards from ancient Egypt have also been recovered from the tomb of Tutankhamun, including a mechanical dice box, no doubt intended to stop cheaters.&#10;&#10;The names of the game were many. In Persia, Takhteh Nard which means &quot;Battle on Wood&quot;. In Egypt, Tau, which may be the ancestor of Senat. In Rome, Ludus Duodecim Scriptorum (&quot;game of twelve marks&quot;), later, Tabula (&quot;table&quot;), and by the sixth century, Alea (&quot;dice&quot;). In ancient China, T-shu-p-u and later in Japan, Sugoroko. The English name may derive from &quot;Bac gamen&quot; meaning &quot;Back Game&quot;, referring to re-entry of taken stones back to the board. It was often enjoyed by the upper classes and is sometimes called &quot;The Aristocratic Game&quot;. The Roman Emperor Claudius was known to be such a fan of Tabula that he had a set built into his coach so he could play as he traveled (the world's first travel edition?).&#10;&#10;The rules in English were standardized in 1743 by Edmond Hoyle. These remained popular until the American innovations of the 1930s.&#10;&#10;";1630;6.56804;2.007
2398;Cribbage;"Cribbage is a card game invented in the early 17th century, based on the earlier game Noddy. It is played with a deck of standard playing cards and a signature piece of equipment called the cribbage board.  Cribbage is traditionally played as a 2 player game.&#10;&#10;In the version usually played today, each player is dealt a hand of 6 cards, from which they discard 2 into a special pile called the Crib.  One card is then cut from the draw pile and turned face up - it is considered part of each player's hand and of the Crib.  The players then play cards in turn, scoring points for hitting certain totals, or for making sets or sequences.  Score is kept by moving pegs along tracks on the cribbage board.  This is repeated until both players have exhausted their hand of cards.&#10;&#10;Next, each player picks up their hand and determines all possible scoring combinations, pegging points again on the cribbage board.  The dealer then picks up the Crib and scores it for all possible points.  Then the cards are shuffled and the deal alternates.  The winner is the first to reach 121 points.&#10;&#10;The origin date listed for this game is approximate.&#10;&#10;";1630;7.10244;1.8982
2399;Senet;"Senet is an ancient Egyptian board game similar to backgammon.  Each player has 5 pawns which travel around a 3 by 10 board in an S shaped path.  Movement is dictated by the throw of 4 sticks (black on one side and white on the other) which can produce a 1,2,3,4, or 6, (5 is not possible) depending on how they land..  As in backgammon, the objective is to bear all of one's pawns off first.  A couple of interesting differences is that there are safe and trap spaces on the board.  Also, players may block each others' progress as in Parchisi.  Senet sets are usually constructed from various woods and are often quite beautiful.  Senet is one of the oldest boardgames but unfortunately it fell out of use for a few thousand years and no ancient rules set has been discovered.  Undoubtably another tragic loss resulting from the Library of Alexandria burning to the ground.  As a result scholars has made several educated guesses as to the rules.  The most popular versions are in the files section.&#10;&#10;It may be a relative of Aseb and The Royal Game of Ur.&#10;&#10;";-3500;5.82817;1.4366

2403;Go Wild!;"Go Wild! is played with a deck of 108 cards (plus a card to signify which player is currently the &quot;Wild One&quot;), 18 each in 5 suits and 18 wild cards. Each round consists of a series of three tricks. Players start each round with 12 cards in hand and replenish their hands only when the round is over. The largest set played in a single color (or single color plus wild cards) wins the trick. The first trick in each round is worth one point, the second trick worth two and the third worth three. The winner of the first trick in each round becomes the &quot;Wild One,&quot; and only that person is allowed to match wild cards to color cards to increase the size of a color set. The &quot;Wild One&quot; retains this power until another player wins the first trick in a subsequent round. The first player to reach 20 points is the winner.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.08925;1.0

Point-scoring combinations include four of a kind (aces, kings, queens and jacks only), a marriage (king and queen of same suit), sequence (A-10 of trump) or a Bezique (queen of spades and jack of diamonds). Bezique uses a subset of the standard playing cards, composed of the seven through Ace taken from two decks (i.e. the deck contains no deuces through sixes, with all other cards appearing twice).&#10;&#10;A game of Bezique goes through three distinct stages or &quot;phases&quot; of play, and is somewhat reminiscent of cribbage and canasta.&#10;&#10;Bezique is the ancestor of Pinochle, and that game's two-handed version is very similar to Bezique but with slightly different deck and slightly different scoring.&#10;&#10;(The origin date listed for this game is approximate.)&#10;&#10;";1860;6.4971;2.3636
2406;Whosit?;"Character Guessing Game&#10;&#10;Players randomly choose one of 20 character cards which depict one of the cast of characters.  Each character has a variety of characteristics.  Each player also gets some question cards.  Each player then takes turns asking their question to the other players.  If you get a Yes, you may draw another question card and ask another question.  If you get a No, you may ask no more questions, but may try to guess the identity of all the players.  A nice mechanism for showing if the player is right is part of the game.  When a player makes his guesses a box is handed around and each player puts a chip in the Yes side if his identity was correctly guessed or a chip in the No side if it was not.  The guessing player looks at the results and the game ends if all the chips are in the Yes side.  Else the game continues.&#10;There are also some oddball characters that will either: always lie, always answer no, or answer yes or no to any question.&#10;&#10;";1976;5.39055;1.3333
2407;Sorry!;"Slide Pursuit Game&#10;&#10;Race your four game pieces from Start around the board to your Home in this Pachisi type game. By turning over a card from the draw deck and following its instructions, players move their pieces around the game board, switch places with players, and knock opponents' pieces off the track and back to their Start position.&#10;&#10;Slides are located at various places around the game board. When a player's piece lands at the beginning of one of these slides not of its own color, it automatically advances to the end, removing any piece on the slide and sending it back to Start.&#10;&#10;Game moves are directed exclusively by cards from the play-action deck.  If one plays the normal version in which one card is drawn from the deck each turn, the outcome has a huge element of luck.  Sorry can be made more of a strategic game (and more appealing to adults) by dealing five cards to each player at the start of the game and allowing the player to choose which card he/she will play each turn.  In this version, at the end of each turn, a new card is drawn from the deck to replace the card that was played, so that each player is always working from five cards.&#10;&#10;A player's fortunes can change dramatically in one or two rounds of play through the use of Sorry cards, the &quot;11&quot; cards (which give the player the option of trading places with an opponent's piece on the track), and the fact that it is possible to move from Start to Home without circumnavigating the full board by making judicious use of the &quot;backward 4&quot; cards.&#10;&#10;";1929;4.54997;1.162

2410;Kanaloa;"Two to four players go from island to island to pick up different fruit to give to the gods. Between the islands are fish to move in one direction (to the fish's mouth). One side of a fish shows the player's color (only this player may move) the other no color (any player may move). After every move the fish is turned to the other color.&#10;&#10;The gods help the player who gives the most fruit; to move (turn direction or color of a fish), to steal (of course from another player), to determine a volcanic eruption (the players near the volcanic eruption lose a turn) or to pick up better fruit.&#10;&#10;The rules are developed from the theme (character of Hawaiian gods, building small stone temples), but it's not historical. The theme and design is similar to Kahuna / Arabana-Ikibiti, but it is more for gamers than for families, and does not require the building of connections.&#10;&#10;Confusingly, Tilsit re-named another game by G&#195;&#188;nter Cornett with a similar island-theme Kanaloa in 2003, but it is different, and more closely related to Kahuna.&#10;&#10;3rd Place 2001 Hippodice Spieleautorenwettbewerb.&#10;&#10;";2001;6.37403;2.6

2417;Charge it!;"Players race to be the first to rack up $50,000 in merchandise charges on their credit cards.&#10;&#10;This game plays like Mille Bornes matched with a memory element. Players draw a card into their hand, and then play one either to the table or discard pile.  Playing a credit card to the table allows the player on future turns to play merchandise cards under it.  Players are not allowed to look at the values of the merchandise once it is played.  Play continues placing cards, either new credit cards (total of 4 types) or merchandise underneath credit cards until a player declares that he has the $10,000 or more, in which they count up the purchases.  The person who declares the round over gets a $2000 bonus, providing that the $10,000 has indeed been reached.&#10;&#10;There is also the ability to spoil your opponents.  There are Lost Card cards which are played on an opponent causing them to have to discard a credit card and the merchandise underneath.  These can be prevented by playing an Insurance card on your pile before to protect a pile, or play another copy of the same credit card in reaction to a Lost Card being played, similar to a Mille Bornes coup-fourr&eacute;.&#10;&#10;Game ends after the round in which total purchases all game exceeds $50,000&#10;&#10;";1972;5.54863;1.0

2420;The Great American Auction Card Game;"Players collect sets of &quot;antiques&quot; related to famous Americans. A complete set is far more valuable than its individual components and brings the best value when sold to the bank. Complete sets vary from two to four related cards (the &quot;antiques&quot; are fairly silly - George Washington's wig, bed, wooden teeth and cherry pits are one example of a complete set of four cards). The player with the most money and assets in antiques at game's end is the winner.&#10;&#10;";1975;5.71591;1.0
2421;Tell Me: The Grand Quiz Game;"Players draw one card at a time, and read what it says. Players are asked to give a word that matches the parameters set out on the game cards (examples: a country, a word ending in &quot;ment,&quot; something that frightens you, a music group starting with __ ). A spinner is used to determine the first letter of the word the player must name. The first player to reach whatever amount of correct answers has been agreed upon is declared winner.&#10;&#10;";1933;5.21815;1.125
2422;Bismarck;"Hunt down and sink the Bismarck. Three levels of play. In the advanced game, you use miniatures rules for the combat. Hidden movement by the use of separate search boards.&#10;&#10;The original Bismarck game from AH was remarkable for one reason: the ONLY playing piece that the German player had was the Bismarck!&#10;&#10;A straight forward move-and-search naval game. If the British player finds the Bismarck, a battle ensues.&#10;&#10;The game is played for points. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins. The game ends when: 1) the Bismarck is sunk, 2) the Bismarck enters Bergen, St. Nazaire, or Ferrol after patrolling, 3) the German gains so many points it is impossible for the British player to win, or 4) time runs out.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill Complexity ratings&#10;  Basic Game - 4&#10;  Intermediate Game - 6&#10;  Advanced Game - 7&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Bismarck (Second Edition)&#10;&#10;&#10;";1962;6.44343;2.7581
2424;Boogey Man;"In this fun little children's game, there are 60 Monster Mania cards depicting the Boogey Man and other inoccuous objects (scary tree, fraidy cat, coat on a rack...) which are easily confused with it at first glance (sharing colours and shapes).  There are one less pillow tokens than players (&agrave; la musical chairs), and each player receives flashlight chips at the outset.  The cards are dealt out to the players, face down.  Every one simultaneously reveals his top card.  If you think one of the cards is the Boogey Man, you scream &quot;Boogey Man!&quot; and try to grab a pillow; the other players must first scream, then try to grab a pillow as well.  The player left without one (if it *is* the Boogey Man) loses a flashlight chip.  You lose a flashlight chip if you caused a false alarm.  (You also lose a flashlight if you forwent screaming, or screamed &quot;Boogey Man!&quot; a second time)&#10;   The player with the most flashlight chips left once another player runs out wins.&#10;&#10;Can be played with up to 9 players when two sets are combined.&#10;&#10;";1987;5.25;1.0
2425;Battleship;"Battleship was originally a pencil-and-paper public domain game known by different names, but Milton Bradley made it into the well known board game in 1967.  The pencil and paper grids were changed to plastic grids with holes that could hold plastic pegs used to record the guesses.&#10;&#10;Each player deploys his ships (of lengths varying from 2 to 5 squares) secretly on a square grid.  Then each player shoots at the other's grid by calling a location.  The defender responds by &quot;Hit!&quot; or &quot;Miss!&quot;.  You try to deduce where the enemy ships are and sink them.  First to do so wins.&#10;&#10;The Salvo variant listed in the rules allows each player to call out from 1 to 5 shots at a time depending on the amount of ships the player has left (IE: players each start off with 5 ships, so they start off with 5 shots.  As ships are sunk, the players gets fewer shots).  This version of the game is closer to the original pencil-and-paper public domain game.  Many versions of the pencil-and-paper game have different amounts of shots based on the ship (IE: Battleship: 5 shots. Destroyer: 3 Shots, Etc.).&#10;&#10;In 2008, Hasbro &quot;reinvented&quot; the game into Battleship (Revised).&#10;&#10;Some history of the published versions of the game:&#10;1931: Starex Novelty Co. of NY publishes Salvo.&#10;1933: The Strathmore Co. publishes Combat, The Battleship Game.&#10;1943: Milton Bradley publishes the pad-and-pencil game Broadsides, The Game of Naval Strategy.&#10;1943: Also published in 1943 Sink it by the L R Gebert Co. for distribution by G.

2426;Hit the Beach;"One of the American Heritage Command Decision Strategy Games.&#10;&#10;A World War II Pacific Campaign game, the players are in a race with each other to reach the &quot;final objective&quot; -- the main Japanese HQ. The Japanese defense forces (14 pieces) are obstacles for all players; when defeated, they are redeployed by that player and can thus be used to slow down opponents.&#10;&#10;Each player has 6 pieces (2 Marines, 2 infantry, 1 naval landing support ship and 1 strategic air support aircraft). On a player's turn, they roll the die and can move one of their soldiers. The support pieces (ship/aircraft) move only on a 6 and are immediately deployed where necessary to support a beach landing. Moving a soldier on top of an opponent's by exact count &quot;relieves&quot; it and sends it back to its start space. Each player must clear the two beaches that match their color. To do this, both support pieces must first be brought to bear, and then a Marine must reach the defender by exact count. Once cleared, beaches remain clear and can be used by all players.&#10;&#10;The mechanics are a variant of the old public domain game of Malefiz or Barricade.&#10;&#10;";1965;5.33046;1.125
2427;Skirmish;"One of the American Heritage Command Decision Strategy Games, highly prized by collectors.&#10;&#10;This one is the American War of Independence game. The British have four armies of 5 units each, 3 warships and a troop carrier with 2 reinforcements on board. The Americans have 16 units spread all over the board (including a special &quot;Continental Army&quot; unit), 1 warship and a troop carrier with 4 reinforcements on board.&#10;&#10;The Americans use two dice for movement (unless down to just one unit), the British one. All three dice are 0-1-1-1-2-3. Both players roll their dice using shakers and peek at them. The British player designates the unit he'll move, then the American reveals his throw and moves. Finally, the Bristish reveals his throw and moves.&#10;&#10;A single unit is moved by each die --the grid is square and no diagonals are allowed. Units that end up on the same spot stack to form an army (which cannot be split), but each army is limited to 6 units. Naval moves are harbour to harbour except for the troop carriers (and any warship attempting to intercept them).&#10;&#10;A Skirmish occurs when opposing units are adjacent. A card is drawn to resolve the Skirmish. This can result in a unit loss for either side (sometimes two), a major battle being triggered, or one or both armies moving a space or two. Major battles normally occur when an army lands on an enemy army by exact count; numerical superiority is added to the stronger side's throw, and the adjusted throw difference indicates how many units the losing side lost (however, that loss is limited to the number of units in the winning army).&#10;&#10;Once the British have lost an army, they can call for Reinforcements. The Americans can do this once they've won a Major Battle. Reinforcement play is resolved separately from normal play. Two dice are used by both sides, one player trying to bring in his troop carrier whilst the other attempts to intercept with a warship (if the opponent has no warships left, the reinforcements automatically succeed). If the troop carrier makes it to a harbor, the reinforcements land (triggering a major battle if the harbor is enemy-held) and the troop carrier remains as a normal warship henceforth.&#10;&#10;The British win by eliminating the Continental Army, whilst the American wins by eliminating all four British armies. To keep the game from dragging on, if there is no skirmish nor major battle in 10 moves, the weaker side surrenders.&#10;&#10;The asymmetrical mechanics work surprisingly well; the British lacks mobility and try to force Major Battles on the Americans, whilst the latter skirmish as much as possible until they can muster a large enough army together to win a major battle and call in their reinforcements.&#10;&#10;";1975;6.27949;1.75
2428;Battle-Cry;"One of the American Heritage Command Decision Strategy Games.&#10;&#10;This one is the American Civil War game.  Each side has 22 pieces (10 infantry, 10 cavalry and 2 artillery), and the starting positions are fixed.  The grid is square, with no diagonal movement allowed.  On your turn, you roll two dice for movement, resulting in between 2 and 12 movement points to allocate.  Infantry moves 1 per pip, cavalry and artillery 2 per pip (a one-square move still consumes 1 pip).  Mountains force pieces to pause (they must stop until the next turn).  Railroads link stations and can be used to accelerate movement (one station per pip).&#10;&#10;Combat is handled by lining pieces up (horizontally or vertically) to face (or flank) an enemy column.  You must have battle strength superiority to resolve the battle, and this is done after movement is concluded.  Infantry and artillery have combat strength 2, cavalry has combat strength 1.  The rear piece then jumps to the other end of the combined columns, and the entire enemy army is removed.  To be used, cavalry must have a piece at the front; artillery, if at the rear of your column, eliminates the enemy army without jumping.  Artillery cannot attack by itself.  Double jumps can happen, if the jumping infantry piece ends up facing a lone cavalry.  An open square must exist to jump to, so some map deployments are &quot;safe&quot; --but not against artillery.  However, pieces trapped so they cannot move are also removed as if they had lost a battle, so this strategy can backfire.&#10;&#10;You win by completely eliminating the enemy army --but a player may concede earlier when a loss becomes unavoidable.  The four player game splits command of each army in two, and is played in partnerships.&#10;&#10;A really good game, combining a historical theme with rather abstract mechanics.&#10;&#10;";1961;5.58478;1.625

2437;The Barons of Fyn;"BoneGames produces a number of do-it-yourself free games.  You download a PDF containing rules and components, and print out what is required for play.&#10;&#10;The Barons of Fyn is a card based strategy game in which competing players each try to become the most mighty Baron of Fyn.&#10;&#10;The Great King Timothy has decided he will leave his kingdom, Fyn, and fight in the great crusades.  While he is gone, he trusts the nobility of the land will behave themselves, as good nobles should.  Little did King Timothy realize that his nobles were planning to use his leaving as a chance to conquer one another.  Knowing the King could come back at any time, the Barons of Fyn each fought to get as much power as possible, so that when the King did return, he would be forced to ally himself with the most powerful Baron.  As a result, the most powerful Baron would hold influence over the King, which could be used to punish the other Barons.&#10;&#10;The Barons of Fyn starts with King Timothy leaving Fyn, and each player becoming one of the Barons who will fight it out for ultimate power.  By expanding his frontiers, each Baron will build new villages, towns, and cities, which are loyal only to him.  These villages, towns, and cities, then allow each Baron to build ever bigger armies with which the Baron can go conquering.  The standard game is played until King Timothy returns to Fyn, at which point, the player with the most victory points is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;Do you have what it takes to become the most mighty Baron of Fyn?&#10;&#10;The game features a dynamic board that is generated as the players lay land cards; however, instead of a Kings-and-Things style board, this one combines some features of Illuminati, in the sense that each player's layout is independent of the others', except that when a group of cards is captured, the entire group is slid to your layout for hook-up, possibly discarding cards that can't fit (that would cause an overlap).&#10;&#10;";1994;5.34783;2.5
2438;LNL: Laplace, Newton & Lagrange;"BoneGames produces a number of do-it-yourself free games.  You download a PDF containing rules and components, and print out what is required for play.&#10;&#10;LNL - Laplace, Newton &amp; Lagrange (briefly known as DeltaVee in its early stages) is a game of ship to ship combat in outer space.  Using a unique movement system that forces players to deal with momentum, and a fast and simple combat system, LNL is a great addition to the space game genre.&#10;&#10;The game involves combat between the Moon and Earth, with individual ships represented by each counter.  Each side has from 3-8 ships.  Each ship has a log covering armament, fuel, engines and defence.  These logs are reminiscent or the Task Force Game 'Starfire', but have fewer options, but a more sophisticated layout.&#10;&#10;The heart of the game is a vector-momentum system (like the one in Yaquinto's Shooting Stars or SPI's Vector Three).  Ships have a facing, use fuel to thrust towards the current facing, but speeds carry over from turn to turn.  Therefore ships can only decelerate only by turning and thrusting in the opposite direction of travel.  Speed is marked by placing numbered counters in the relevant direction.&#10;&#10;Combat involves the use of missiles, guns (i.e. projectile weapons) and lasers.  Missiles are launched and move much like ships.  They are more manoeuvrable, but have a limited amount of fuel, used for acceleration and turning.  As a defence ships may have point defence weapons.  Guns and lasers are ranged weapons, with different arcs of fire, but essentially the same resolution.  Damage is assessed by throwing the requisite number of dice - any dice will do, or  even coins - the game using an EOR (even/odds randomiser) - with odd rolls yielding a hit.  Damage is then marked off the ship, with the affected area depending on the side through which fire was taken.&#10;&#10;Each side (Moon and Earth) has a choice of 8 types of ships and 5 basic scenarios are available, each with a great deal of flexibility.  Tactics can be involved and subtle.  The  interplay of weapon types makes this an exciting game.  It is easy to learn and has great variety.&#10;&#10;";1994;5.67;2.0
2439;Queen Victoria's Navy;"Queen Victoria's Navy is a nautical combat war game for two players which simulates the period from 1880-1906.  The game scale is 500 meters per hex and about 5 minutes per turn.  Capital ships are modeled individually.  Complexity is medium.  Time to learn is from 30-45 minutes.&#10;&#10;Players take the role of squadron commanders, the principal tactical leaders in the battle fleet.  As such, they are in charge of a manageable force of capital ships, generally 3-12.  Designed for 2 players, Queen Victoria's Navy is also suitable for solitaire or multiple players, each scenario taking about 1 hour to complete.&#10;&#10;This game manages to blend three often contradictory goals together seamlessly: affordability, game-play, and authenticity.  The focus of the game is to recreate the conditions of a capital ship battle.  Torpedo boats, gunboats and sundry other smaller vessels have been left out of the game as they were not critical components of the Battle Fleet concept, and their inclusion would have added complexity and cost to the game.  However, thanks to the simplicity of the rules, it is an easy task to design these craft for your own games.&#10;&#10;";1996;6.45833;2.3333

It may seem similar to other games, but Bones has a unique aspect that makes game play very different from what you might expect!  Can you deal with the overlapping of pieces better than your opponent?&#10;&#10;The game is played on a 9x12 grid, with pieces that measure 1x2; each player gets a set of 18 pieces, but more can be made if necessary.  The first tile must be played so it occupies part of the middle; later tiles can be played anywhere as long as they're entirely within the playing area and as long as it does not cover up an already played tile in one move (in other words, it's OK to cover a tile completely, but this must be done in two turns).&#10;&#10;";1994;5.32;1.25

2444;Carrier Strike!;"This game pits two aircraft carrier task forces against each other; each player has two carriers loaded with 6 torpedoes and 4 aircraft.  Pilots are represented by ratings which are embarked on the aircraft when launched.  The carriers move with a special die which gives each carrier a 50-50 chance of either moving forward one or turning 60 degrees.  The aircraft move with a normal d6.  If they manage to manoeuvre at torpedo run distance from an enemy carrier (6 hexes), drop their torpedoes.  These move inexorably one space per turn so the only defence is manoeuvring.  If the aircraft get within dogfight distance of each other (4 hexes), they may engage in a dogfight, which uses cards (a better pilot rating gives you extra cards) --it also forces the torpedoes to be dropped, so sacrifice dogfights are a viable tactic.  If you run out of torpedoes, you may kamikaze your aircraft.&#10;&#10;An amusing tactical simulation, very simple and fast-playing, with nice bits to boot.&#10;&#10;Remade in to Mission Command Sea.&#10;&#10;";1977;6.08445;1.4286
2445;Chaseback;"This is an unusual two-player strategy game.  The board consists of five columns, within each of which a &quot;man&quot; moves back and forth.  The men are moved by both players.  At the ends of each column are the players' goals (one end belongs to one player, the other end to his opponent).  Each player tries to reach his goals by exact count, scoring a point every time this is achieved.  First player to reach 15 points wins.&#10;   The spaces within the columns are numbered in seemingly random fashion, except for the centre row, which is all numbered 4.  The game starts with all men in the centre.  One player calls out a number from 1 to 5.  His opponent then moves a man that number of spaces in either direction (no back-and-forthing allowed).  The number on the space onto which the man lands gives the move for the next man --and this mechanism applies throughout the game, so the only random element is the initial call of 1 to 5.&#10;   Each player moves three different men, then his opponent does the same (the first man he moves cannot be the last one you moved), and so on.  Every time a man reaches a goal (by exact count), a point is scored and the man teleports back to the centre.  To complicate matters slightly, there are two &quot;safe spaces&quot; in each column, those on one side of the centre belonging to one player, those on the other to his opponent.  A player may not move more than two men onto safe spaces at once.  You cannot move a man from your opponent's safe spaces, so this is used to constrain the opponent's possible moves.&#10;   A software version of this would be very interesting, particularly if the board could be randomised...&#10;&#10;";1962;4.6875;1.0

Choppers move on the elevated &quot;air&quot; board, whilst jeeps stick to the ground.  Terrain obstacles complicate matters for the jeeps at the players' &quot;border&quot;.  Choppers take choppers out by jumping over them (&agrave; la checkers); they can also take jeeps out by bombing them (stopping right above them).  Jeeps take jeeps out by landing on them; they can also take choppers out using their AA guns (stopping right below them).&#10;&#10;";1976;5.34178;1.4783

2448;Kalah;"The most common rule set in games sold commercially as Mancala is for this game of Kalah. Mancala is actually a whole family of games. Kalah was invented in 1940 by an American, William Champion Jr..  He started selling the game in 1944, patented the rules in the 1950's, and founded the Kalah Game Co. in 1958.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a board of two rows, each consisting of six round pits. The rows have a large store at either end called the Kalah. A player owns the six pits closest to them and the Kalah on their right side.&#10;&#10;The game is started with four (4) seeds in each pit. A player takes all the seeds from one of their pits, and then they are distributed one by one, counterclockwise, in the pits and the player's own Kalah, but not into the opponent's store (Kalah). If the last seed is dropped into an opponent's pit or a non-empty pit of the player, the move ends without anything being captured. If the last seed falls into the player's Kalah, they must move again. If the last seed is put into an empty pit owned by the player, they capture all contents of the opposite pit together with the capturing piece and puts them in their Kalah. If the opposite pit is empty, nothing is captured. A capture ends the move.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player no longer has any seeds in any of their holes. The remaining pieces are captured by their adversary. The player who has captured the most pieces is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;Variants:&#10;&#10;Beginners may start with 3 seeds in each pit, but the game can also be played with 5 or 6 seeds in each pit. William Champion Jr. recommended the expert game with 6 in each pit.&#10;&#10;In the Philippines Version (called Sungka locally) the game is often played with small shells, there are 7 pits on each side as well as the Home and the game is started with 7 shells in each pit.&#10;&#10;";700;5.99651;1.5992

2450;Deuce;"These 52 cards, 11 cards (0 through 10) in each of 4 colour suits plus 6 Rainbow cards and 2 X cards.  You try to go out (empty your hand) during each hand; score is kept and the first player to reach 100 wins.&#10;   Each player is dealt 6 cards.  You begin by placing two cards of your choice in front of you, face up, to create two discard piles.  The two cards played must match either by colour or by number.  In turn, you play one card from your hand onto any of the discard piles.  To play onto a pile, the card played must match the other pile's card in number or colour.  If you can't or don't wish to play a card, you must draw cards until you can play one.  Should the draw be exhausted, a new deck is made from the discard piles, keeping only the topmost cards.&#10;   To go out, your discard piles must at least tie all the others in number value.  Score is 10 points for the player who went out, plus the combined values of the cards left in the other players' hands.  The discards aren't scored.&#10;   Rainbow cards are wild, being of all four colours at once --they match any card.  The card value is zero, which may be handy to reduce an opponent's discard piles value.  X cards (also worth zero), on the other hand, can only be matched by Rainbow or X cards.&#10;&#10;";1985;5.46585;1.0
2451;Slasher Flick;"From the publisher:&#10;&#10;Slasher Flick:  Revenge of the Bogeyman in Exciting 2-D&#10;&quot;This Butcher Does More Than Bring Home the Bacon!&quot;&#10;&#10;Simulates the action in body-count movies such as Halloween, Friday the 13th, Silent Scream and others.  One player represents the Bogeyman, a superhuman maniacal mass murderer, and the other takes the part of the collection of victims he intends to murder. Movement of the 14 characters including a Bus Driver, Whiz Kid, Football Player, Surfer, BMOC, Biker, ROTC, Psych Major, Cheerleader, Jockette, Preppie, Valley Girl, Ingenue takes place on the map. The victims try to stay alive as long as possible. Each character has a unique set of attributes for movement, special abilities, disadvantages and damage.&#10;&#10;Can be played as a board role-playing game (and thus expanded past just two players). One player takes the role of the Bogeyman; other players take the roles of only a few of the victims. This can lead to some animated conversation between the Victim players, sounding suspiciously like the real thing.&#10;&#10;Developed by Aaron Allston. Art by Paul McCall. Map art by J.

2452;Jenga;"Jenga is tower building game played with 54 wooden blocks; each block is 3 times as long as it is wide, and slightly smaller in height than in width. The blocks are stacked in a tower formation; each story is three blocks placed adjacent to each other along their long side, and each story is placed perpendicular to the previous (so, for example, if the blocks in the first story are pointing north-south, the second story blocks will point east-west). There are therefore 18 stories to the Jenga tower. Since stacking the blocks neatly can be tedious, a plastic loading tray is included.&#10;&#10;Once the tower is built, the person who built the tower moves first. Moving in Jenga consists of taking one and only one block from any story except the completed top story of the tower at the time of the turn, and placing it on the topmost story in order to complete it. Only one hand at a time may be used to remove a block; both hands can be used, but only one hand may be on the tower at a time. Blocks may be bumped to find a loose block that will not disturb the rest of the tower. Any block that is moved out of place may be left out of place if it is determined that it will knock the tower over if it is removed. The turn ends when the next person to move touches the tower, although he or she can wait 10 seconds before moving for the previous turn to end if they believe the tower will fall in that time.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the tower falls in any significant way -- in other words, any piece falls from the tower, other than the piece being knocked out to move to the top. The loser is the person who made the tower fall (i.e. whose turn it was when the tower fell); the winner is the person who moved before the loser.&#10;&#10;The same game concept was published in 1984 by Fagus under the name &quot;Hoppla - eins zuviel!&quot; According to the designer, the game was developed from Takoradi blocks/bricks. &quot;Jenga&quot; is Swahili for &quot;build&quot;.&#10;&#10;";1983;5.65389;1.104
2453;Blokus;"Blokus (officially pronounced &quot;Block us&quot;) is an abstract strategy game with transparent, Tetris-shaped, colored pieces that players are trying to play onto the board.  The only caveat to placing a piece is that it may not lie adjacent to your other pieces, but instead must be placed touching at least one corner of your pieces already on the board.&#10;&#10;There is a solitaire variation where one player tries to get rid of all the pieces in a single sitting.&#10;&#10;Goal of the Game:&#10;&#10;Each player has to fit as many of his/her 21 pieces on the board as possible.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;Blokus Game Board (400 squares)&#10;84 game pieces (four 21-piece sets of red, green, blue, and yellow)&#10;Each color inlcudes:&#10;&#10;     1 one-square piece&#10;     1 piece with 2 squares&#10;     2 pieces with 3 squares&#10;     5 pieces with 4 squares&#10;     12 pieces with 5 squares&#10;&#10;&#10;";2000;6.86134;1.7385

Try to safely navigate your way to the Lonely Mountain and reclaim all the treasure that the evil dragon Smaug is hiding &ndash; but beware as the treasure is fiercely guarded and must be won in battle! Will you trade your jewels for adventure points? Can you successfully answer the riddles or recite the songs? Do you have the courage to steal a jewel right from under Smaug's nose?&#10;&#10;On this adventure you'll travel through the Edge of the Wild, the Misty Mountains, the Carrock, Mirkwood, Long Lake, and finally confront the Desolation of Smaug. Each terrain will yield magical encounters and valuable treasure. All your wit, luck and skill will be tested. Are you up to the challenge to be crowned King Under the Mountain?&#10;&#10;";2001;4.8647;1.3008
2457;Torpedo Run!;"This huge box (88&times;44&times;7 cm) was part of MB's Floor Wars Series. Indeed, it is playable only on a floor --unless you have something large to put it on, like Ping-Pong tables. The board measures 34&frac12;&times;46&frac12; inches!&#10;&#10;This game is an introduction to naval miniatures of sorts; each player has four very large miniatures of WWII vintage ships (a battleship with its three escort ships) which manoeuvre about the large board.  The players also have a &quot;torpedo launcher&quot; shaped like a submarine which fires discs that glide along the playing surface.  The players aim at specific places along the ship waterlines.  There, slots allow the discs to slide under the ship and trip a rubber-band mechanism which sends part of the ship's superstructure (or gun turrets) flying, simulating damage.&#10;&#10;";1986;6.12616;1.2963

2460;House of Horrors;"A card game based on Avalon Hill's Atlantic Storm in which players explore a Haunted House.  Each turn players can either play an explorer card (and appropriate items) or a monster card (and appropriate items).  This creates two teams: explorers vs. monsters.  Whichever side has the most points in the chosen combat category wins.  After each victory, the spoils (room card and cards from the losing side) are divided up among the winners.  The player who has the most hourglass symbols on the cards they win wins the game.&#10;&#10;";2000;5.81667;1.7273
2463;Scavenger Hunt;"The object of this game is to find and bring back Home four randomly designated objects (out of a possible selection of 16), in sequence, as in a Scavenger Hunt.&#10;&#10;The objects are deployed on the board using a semi-random method.  Then play begins.  You use dice to move your pawn, but cards are required to move through house rooms --otherwise you're confined to the sidewalks (without the right cards, you may also end up &quot;trapped in a garage&quot;, the only room that does not have a direct exit to the sidewalk).  Pairs of cards can also be traded in for extra turns.  Additionally, there are two dogs roaming the sidewalks, which are obstacles and controlled by card play.&#10;&#10;";1983;5.12758;1.25
2464;Swords & Sorcery: Quest and Conquest in the Age of Magic;"[SPI Advertisement c1978]&#10;&#10;SWORDS AND SORCERY&#10;Quest and Conquest in the Age of Magic&#10;&#10;- Separate Army and Quest Game, plus Role-Playing Version&#10;- Full Background &ldquo;History&rdquo; and Characters&#10;- Professionally Illustrated by Tim Kirk&#10;&#10;The Valley of the Great Sword is a much warred over area on a small planet in a trinary system many lightyears and eons removed from Terra.  Superficially, there is no great difference between this highly prized region and any other coveted area that nations have fought over since time immemorial.  But the Valley, and indeed the whole planet, guards a secret so valuable that few off-planet visitors that have visited that remote corner of the galaxy have all been mercilessly killed.  For the Valley is an area of great magicks, where technology has all but disappeared.&#10;&#10;Long ago in the Age of the Great Upheaval (which not even the oldest of the denizens of the Valley can recall), the Council of Wizards abolished all weapons that were more advance than those used in Earth's Middle Ages.  This was because (most scholars have it) mages could be killed by long range weapons before they could employ their defensive spells, and greatly feared the advent of mass-produced technology.  But the population of that world trusted mages no more than you and I, and there followed a series of great wars which succeeded in devastating all areas of the planet with the exception of the Valley (called Ararlve by the ancients).&#10;&#10;A great meeting was held at the Altar of the Elder Gods, and its purpose was to determine whether the Human race should be allowed to survive.  The Dragons, The Swamp-Creatures and the Spiders all vociferously argued for the extermination of all mortals, as they greatly feared the return of wizards who would be able to challenge their power.  But the Elves and Dwarrows who are kin to Man showed mercy, and the meeting finally resolved that mortals would forever be excluded from the Valley.  Grisha, then the greatest among Dragons, prophesied that the Elves and Dwarrows would meet their doom at the hands of Men.  This so enraged Gwaimallion Elflord that he joined Grisha in mortal combat and slew him on the spot.  As Grisha died he pronounced his deathcurse upon Elves and Dwarrows, &ldquo;My prophecy shall come true within three Ages!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;It was a shaken group of creatures who adjourned the great meeting.  But none would for get Grisha's curse, and many sought to destroy Men in any way possible.  Even some of the Elves and Dwarrows, fearful of the prophecy, sought to kill Men wherever they might be found.  But the human race is a hardy one, and is not so easy to eliminate.  For an entire Age, Men throughout the planet barely survived, running from their many oppressors.  But when the Second Age dawned, the other races began to accept Men, and rudimentary civilizations developed.&#10;&#10;Since the beginning of recorded time, all races have shown equal adeptness at handling manna, the energy from which all magic emanates.  But only the race of Man can create power items, which are great storehouses of manna.  And with these power items the race of Man evolves superhumans adept at handling the items.  It is this chain of events that all other races fear, for a united human race can defeat all other inhabitants of the world combined once they reach this stage.&#10;&#10;And so, at the beginning of the Third Age A.U. (After the Upheaval), the race of Man began to dominate once again.  The reappearance of Wizards and the conquest of half the world occurred in less than one century.  The Elder Races recognized this threat for what it was, but they were unable to co-operate amongst each other due to age-old differences.  The situation became dire when the various nations coalesced into the Second Empire.  Soon all lands but the Valley were Human-controlled.&#10;&#10;The Valley, root of the most powerful magic, from which the power of Man stemmed, now ironically provided refuge from Man.  The Valley could not be tamed by Man, and in its own defense it produced great amounts of manna.  At this point, forces of the Empire invaded the fabled city of Urf Durfal on the outskirts of the Valley and sought to conquer it in one swift stroke.  Leading the charge into the Valley was Emperor Coron the Unconquerable, and his defeat at the hands of Zurik Bladebreaker Dwarfking signaled the rebirth of the ancient races.  But that was not all, that was coming back to the Valley.  Two great and evil wizards each sought to be the Dark Lord, while a renegade noble sought to establish a separate nation in the heart of the Valley.  Contact was made with the inhabitants of the daemonic plane, and all sorts of demons, minor and major, roamed the Valley.  To cap it all off, discovery of several of the ancient and most powerful power items occurred.  The Empire had a most formidable challenge.&#10;&#10;Swords and Sorcery is a game portraying the climactic period of the War against the Elder Races.  The Army Game, which deals with the &ldquo;historical&rdquo; battles of the war, uses a fairly simple combat system so that the Players may better explore the detailed spell lists, the Diplomacy rules and the various game mechanics that deal with all the elements necessary to fantasy.  Twelve Scenarios, beginning with the aforementioned Coron's campaign in the Valley and concluding with the final attempt to capture the Valley by the Empire, deal with all the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; fantasy situations.  Each Player is given control of an army and one or more Characters.  While the individual army units are important, it is the Characters who dominate the Army Game, by their leadership and (for those with magical abilities) their spell-casing abilities.&#10;&#10;Also included in the Swords and Sorcery package is a Quest Game, which involves the Players using the various Characters during periods where there is a lull in the War.  A Player will be given a specified number of Characters and objective, and seeks to perform better against the nasties or villain than his opponent(s).  Of course, your brave fighter may be vanquished by a fearsome troll before he is able to battle the guardian of the sword he seeks, or your Magic User may be defeated by a Spectre.  There are great perils in the Valley.  It will not do for a Dwarf to go merrily traipsing through the provinces of the Elves, else he be captured and need to be rescued by his kindred.  But a band of battle-hardened adventurers can defeat nearly any threat that besets them &ndash; the challenge is to avoid the death of one or more of the brave questers.  All of these possibilities are handled by such rules as the expansion of the spell list, a detailed personal combat routine, and even a Section on how to create your own character, if those provided with the game do not satisfy.&#10;&#10;Swords and Sorcery includes a 22&rdquo; by 35&rdquo; game-map which portrays the Valley of the Great Sword, 400 four-color counters which represent many different races &ndash; Human, Elf, Dwarf, Goblin, Hobgoblin, Spider, Dragon, Swamp-Creature, Cronk, Demon and Monster &ndash; that live in or intrude upon the Valley, 56 illustrated cards, consisting of 40 Character illustrations, 10 Magic (or Power) Item illustrations, and 6 Monster illustrations, and a lengthy rules booklet including an extensive fantasy background.&#10;&#10;Swords and Sorcery represents the culmination of over a year's work, and includes a wide range of fantasy elements.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;This fantasy wargame is really two games in one. The Army game uses SPI zones-of-control and a combat results table. Forces include elves, dwarves, orcs, spiders, swamp creatures and a host of others set in a fictional valley on a fictional world. Some of the more exotic inclusions are memorable for their pun value:  Unamit Ahezredit, Logarithm Son of Algorithm; places such as the Evelyn Woods and the Stream of Consciousness, as well as the notorious Hills of Avalon; and peoples such as the Corflu (Correction Fluid) Cultists, the (communist) Orcish Revolutionary Council, and the dreaded Killer Penguins.  X the Unknown could potentially conjure the SS Wiking Division. The Quest game is concerned exclusively with characters and is akin to a role-playing game.The game appeared with two covers: a blue box with a Tim Kirk illustration and a red box with a John Butterfield illustration. The games are otherwise identical.&#10;&#10;";1978;6.98526;3.2258
2465;Not Necessarily Rum;"Unique card game similar to canasta, rum and hand and foot.  Two, three, four, or six players.  Two dealers every hand, 2 hands every deal.  Game is 25,000 points.  Like canasta on steroids.&#10;&#10;";1988;6.0;1.0
2466;Freeze Frame!;"The board consists of a 3x3 felt grid on which move eight wooden tokens (four of each of two colours).  You are dealt five &quot;frame pattern&quot; cards *after* initial deployment of your pieces.  Yellow begins by moving any one of his pieces to the empty space on the grid.  Black does the same in turn.  Every time the pattern formed by your pieces matches that shown on one of your cards (you're allowed to orient the cards freely), you shout &quot;Freeze Frame!&quot; and score that card.  You then replace the card with a newly drawn one.  First player to score five cards wins.  Play can be prolonged either by going for a larger number of cards or by going through the entire deck of 34 frame patterns.&#10;   Each card shows four white dots and ignores the opponent's piece deployment, so you're really playing two different games at once and just getting in each other's way.  Neat.&#10;&#10;";1974;5.48;1.4286
2467;Zillionaire;"This game is a close relative of The Great Dalmuti and Dilbert's Corporate Shuffle. In it, each player is ranked (and seated) according to his wealth (Poor / Thin Ice / Credit Crazy / Upper Crust / Money to Burn / Rich).&#10;&#10;The entire deck of 62 cards is dealt out, minus two cards. The first and last player exchange two cards, the next-to-first and next-to-last exchange one. The player to the left of the dealer (the Rich player) begins by playing a set of cards (quantity and face value). The following player can either play the same quantity but higher value or pass. This round continues until all pass; after which another round starts. Players rank (for the next hand) in the order in which they go out.&#10;&#10;Score is kept for the agreed upon number of hands (no more than 10). Poor scores 1, Thin Ice 2, etc. High score wins.&#10;&#10;Interestingly, the value 5 cards are wild in the sense that a single 5 can represent any number of fives. When played to start a round, the following player determines the quantity. The other cards are Zillionaire (4 in deck), Millionaire (4), Bankroll (3; if played on top of a Bankrupt card, cannot be beaten), Bankrupt (3; can only be beaten by a Bankroll), Bump (3; forces the player to your left to Pass), 8 through 1 (6 of each except for Fives, of which there are only 3).&#10;&#10;";1987;6.00208;1.0
2468;Zero Zap;"The object of this game is to score Sets and Runs of cards and trying to go out first. First to score 50 wins.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt 7 of the 108 cards. On your turn, you either draw 1 or 2 cards, or pick up one or more cards from the playing area (more on this later). Then you play your sets (3 or 4 cards of same color and value) and runs (3 to 7 consecutive cards of the same color) or increase already played sets and runs. Finally, you must discard a card; special cards are truly discarded once their effects are resolved; the other cards are discarded to the playing area, slightly overlapping each other in sequence. When you pick up a card from the playing area, it must be used to play a run or set and you must pick up any cards that follow it (were discarded after it).&#10;&#10;Going out scores a 5-point bonus and ends the round. All played sets and runs score (sets are worth 2 per card; runs are worth 1 per card); cards left in hand penalize you 1 point per card.&#10;&#10;The number cards (84) come in 3 colors and run from 1 to 7 (there are four of each). Wild cards (6) can replace any number card but cannot be played to form their own sets or runs. Double cards (3) are used to double the value of all of your sets and runs of a given color. The Special cards (14) do various things such as reshuffling the draw and discard decks, stealing a set, run or double, giving a card away, etc. The Zero Zap card (1), if left in your hand when someone goes out, zaps your score for that round to zero (Yikes!). However, if played as a Special to go out, it zaps someone else's (of your choosing) round score!&#10;&#10;";1987;5.30952;1.0
2469;Wildcatter;"&quot;The Authentic Oil &amp; Gas Exploration Game&quot; has an educational aspect to it, as the drilling success ratios, drilling depths, costs and monthly production figures were taken from the real world.&#10;&#10;The game is played within the U.S. and Alaska; the players lease properties and drill for oil and gas, trying to get rich.  On each lease, you must decide whether to go for shallow or deep wells --once a well has been drilled, even a dry hole, all future drilling must be done at the same depth, even if the lease changes hands.  The first few wells are Exploratory and have lesser chances of success; once a producing well has been drilled, further drilling is Developmental.  When you land on a player's lease, you buy its monthly oil production from him; landing on your own lease nets you double that amount (paid by the bank).  Payments also roll in every time you go around the board.&#10;&#10;Random events are injected by Wildcat and Blowout cards.  The rest of the game falls in line with what its design is: a Monopoly clone.  Big box with lots of fairly nice bits, however.&#10;&#10;";1981;5.44571;2.1429
2470;The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen;"This not-quite-a-role-playing-game requires players to sit around telling fantastic (but completely true!) stories. Players may attempt to trip up another player's story by wagering a token (&quot;But the Prussian Army had dissolved by that time, m'lord, so you could not have possibly fought it single-handedly&quot;), whereas the storyteller must counter with another token (and an excuse) or swallow their pride and incorporate it into their story (with another excuse). There are also a few, minor details, mostly used to get boring storytellers to stop. The game is won after each player has told one story. Each player, in turn, gives *all* their tokens to another player they believe has told the best story--so collecting the most tokens doesn't make you the winner, it makes you be able to choose the winner. Of course, the best story-telling wins the game.&#10;&#10;Re-published 2002 (starting at Essen) by Krimsus KrimsKrams-Kiste as Die unfasslichen Abenteuer des Freiherrn von M&uuml;nchhausen.&#10;&#10;Is also listed on RPGGeek as The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen&#10;&#10;";1998;7.25103;1.4643
2471;Zombies!!!;"Players take on the role of a survivor amid city streets sprawling with Zombies. Movement is determined by dice roll as is combat when the player's piece is in the same square as a Zombie. Players must conserve bullets and protect their life counters. At the end of the turn a dice roll directs the player to move a number of Zombies one square (because they are the slow George Romero type).&#10;&#10;First player to reach the center of the Helipad tile and kill the Zombie there, or kill a total of 25 Zombies wins. When a player is killed they move back to the starting tile and lose half their Zombie kills.&#10;&#10;Zombies!!! is the original game in the Zombies!!! series.&#10;&#10;";2001;5.7918;1.6126

Russian units are Corps, German units are a mish-mash of battallions, brigades, and a few regiments. The map has two scales, an operational-scale covering the Elbe to the jump-off lines on the Oder, and a &quot;grand tactical&quot; map of Berlin itself.

2476;Industrial Waste;"Industrial Waste is a fast but deep game designed by J&#195;&#188;rgen Strohm in which the players are running factories. Players buy materials, complete orders and invest money in technology improvements to earn VPs, but they need to keep an eye on their waste output. If players have too much waste in their factory dump they are liable to suffer an environmental disaster and have to pay hefty cleanup costs. Development of technological improvements requiring less waste, fewer resources, and reduced workforce are the key to this game.&#10;&#10;The game features bidding for resources, hand management and some drafting of cards to gain actions. The first player to grow their factory to a value of twenty triggers the end and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;";2001;6.665;2.6301
2477;Kippour 1973;"This is an operational game covering the Golan and Sinai battles of the Yom Kippour war in 1973.&#10;&#10;It is a moderate-complexity wargame using an Operation Points system where combat and movement are done within a given unit's phase. Players alternate activating formations.&#10;&#10;The rules are in French and are complete, although somewhat murky at times. The game may have benefited from a more rigourous editing effort. As usual with VV, beautiful components. All in all, a robust effort from the Vae Victis team.&#10;&#10;";2001;6.5;2.4286
2478;Quirks;"From the back of the box:&#10;&#10;Create strange plants and animals - QUIRKS of nature.  Struggle to keep your creations alive in a world of rapidly changing climates.  Strive to be the first player to make three dominant QUIRKS.  Match wits against opponents who threaten your survival.  But BEWARE!  If three of your QUIRKS become extinct, you've lost the game.&#10;&#10;In Quirks, players build unusual plants, herbivores, and carnivores by combining cards that show one of three segments of that plant or creature. Each card is of a particular quirk: a distinctive trait that may give a bonus. Players attempt to create the dominant species of Plant, Herbivore, and Carnivore in the current niche for that turn's climate type -- Ocean, Forest, Plains, Desert and Jungle.&#10;&#10;Included are rules for solitaire play, but otherwise Quirks is good for 2-4 players using the standard game.  There are also simplified rules for Quirklings, a streamlined version of the game designed for children of ages 7-11, which can handle 2-6 players.&#10;&#10;";1980;6.10202;1.9714
2479;Candidate;"A U.S. presidential election game.  Players move from state to state.  Each turn a player draws 2 of 3 possible cards: campaigning, fundraising, or dirty tricks.  Campaigning gives you votes in your current state.  Fundraising give you money which can be spent secretly.  Dirty tricks allow you to hurt your opponents, but they sometimes backfire.&#10;&#10;";1979;5.82353;1.5
2480;Tribes;"Tribes is a role-playing game that plays a lot like a board game and simulates the way our ancestors lived long ago. The players are cave men and women. They hunt and gather food, make their tribal laws, and deal with natural disasters, but the object of the game is simple: Look after the children! In this game, the way to win is to have the most kids and do whatever you have to do to make sure they survive to adulthood. The players must know when to cooperate, and when to cut their losses and protect their own families. Players can re-create &ndash; and change &ndash; the earliest human societies by instituting their own laws and social patterns, and see what effects the rules of society have on their ability to survive and reproduce.&#10;&#10;With several copies of the game and a referee, it's possible to have several tribes playing at once, competing, trading, exchanging members, and even making war on each other.&#10;&#10;";1998;6.5271;2.0769
2482;Zaxxon;"The galaxy is in peril! The evil robot Zaxxon and its legion of followers have conquered an asteroid belt! It's your job to ward off this threat before it's too late.&#10;Published in 1983, the Zaxxon Board Game was one of Milton Bradley&rsquo;s numerous attempts to translate video games to board games.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY THE GAME: &#10;1. ROLLING THE DIE: both players roll their die AT THE SAME TIME. Reroll the die if there is a tie. On EACH turn, the player rolling the Lower Number on the die ALWAYS plays first. Then the player rolling the Higher Number plays second. &#10;2. USING THE SPINNER: the player rolling the Lower Number spins the spinner. The spinner controls enemy fire directed at fighter planes from missile silos and gun turrets (later in the game the spinner will also control the movement of Zaxxon). When RED is spun, any plane that is in or enters a missile silo area CONTAINING A MISSILE SILO is shot down and returned to its home base. When BLUE is spun, any plane that is in a gun turret area CONTAINING A GUN TURRET is shot down and returned to its home base. If a missile silo or a gun turret has been shot and removed from the board, there is no enemy fire from that area so any planes in that area are safe. Notice that the missile silo areas are surrounded by a red border and the gun turret areas are surrounded by a blue border. See Figures 5A and 5B for locations. When WHITE is spun, all planes are safe. Please Note: if your plane is shot down by a missile silo or gun turret in the inner fortress, return it to a RESTART space in your outer fortress. &#10;3. ORDER OF PLAY: after spinning the spinner, the player who rolled the Lower Number moves his or her plane or planes according to the die count just rolled. Then the player who rolled the Higher Number moves his or her plane or planes according to the die count just rolled. You can move one of your planes the full amount on the die or move both of your planes, splitting the die count between them in any combination&#10;4. HOW A FIGHTER PLANE MOVES: a fighter plane can move from one space to any adjacent space by die count as shown in Figure 6. A plane can change direction or land on the same space more than once on the same turn. A plane cannot pass over or land on a space occupied by another plane. A fighter plane can &quot;fly&quot; at High Altitude or Low Altitude by raising or lowering it on its base. Each change in altitude (either High to Low or Low to High) counts as ONE on your die count. Your plane must be at Low Altitude to shoot a target and at High Altitude to cross a wall.&#10;&#10;HOW TO WIN THE GAME: &#10;Be the first player to destroy your enemy targets and shoot Zaxxon with both of your fighter planes.&#10;&#10;";1982;4.37138;1.1818

2484;Explore Europe;"A travelling game through Continental Europe.&#10;Each player begins in a home city and draws 8 cards for other cities they must visit by a combination of land, sea and air travel. Roll a die each turn for movement, with players trying to choose the optimal routes. The first player to visit all their cities and return home wins.&#10;&#10;The limitation of using only 1 mode of transport per turn, as well as increasing cost for air based on distance, increases the analysis and decisions required. Certain 'special' city cards also provide benefits (extra turn, free movement, etc.) or penalties (miss a turn, mandatory travel).  With 180 cities on the board, there are multiple paths to choose each turn, and no two games are ever the same!&#10;A Ravensburger Family game.&#10;Note: The rule book also includes educational information about notable attractions for the 63 'special' cities.&#10;&#10;";1954;5.1254;1.375
2485;Game of the States;"This game teaches the location of each of the states, the capital city, its important industries and products, which the players buy and sell. The object of the game is to buy a product in one state and haul it on a truck to another state where you try to sell it at a profit.  &quot;Who Sells the Most From Coast to Coast?&quot;&#10;&#10;";1940;4.73908;1.3889
2486;Flipop;"The Flipop board consists of a 5x5 grid of spaces.  In each of the 16 intersections between four spaces, there is a post holding a door that can swing around so that it blocks access between any adjacent two spaces of the four spaces around it.  Each player has five balls on his side of the board.  The object is to move the balls across the board, at which point they are removed from the game.  To move, you must push a ball through a door.  If there is a ball in the space beyond the door, it will be pushed -- this can cascade indefinitely.  But a move is only legal as long as each ball lands either in an empty space or goes through another door -- balls cannot touch each other.  The winner is either the first person to remove all his balls from the board, or the player with the fewest balls left when no legal moves remain.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.86842;1.5
2487;Why;"&quot;Alfred Hitchcock presents...The Game of Why&quot;&#10;&#10;Once upon a time, six people on their way to a costume party took shelter from a storm in a haunted house...And were never seen alive since.  But they still haunt the house.  You must try to find out who was murdered, by what means and why.&#10;&#10;The cards include Motive cards, No Clue cards and a single &quot;It's a Mystery to Me&quot; card.  In addition, there are cards that can be assembled side by side to form larger pictures: the six guests (Cleopatra, Napoleon, etc. --they were costumed, you see; in four pieces), four weapons (also in four pieces) and Alfred Hitchcock (in six pieces).  Seven cards are dealt to each player, the rest into the house's rooms.  You enter a room by exact count, except that a 7, 11 or doubles allows you to go directly to the spot of your choice.  When you reach a room, you pick up the top card there and discard either it or another card from your hand to the &quot;Lawn&quot; --off the board.  These cards are laid face down without overlapping each other but are shown to the other players as they're laid down.  Later, you may try to recover a Lawn card by showing a card from your hand of the appropriate type (a piece of a guest, for example) and then pointing to a Lawn card and picking it up.  If you remembered right, you may repeat the procedure.  You can also claim cards from other players by meeting them in the house and &quot;accusing them&quot; of withholding a particular card (this is what the No Clue cards are defence for).  Once the rooms are empty, everyone gathers in the hall and play is speeded up.&#10;&#10;First player to assemble a Ghost, Weapon and Motive OR Alfred and &quot;It's a Mystery to Me&quot; wins.&#10;&#10;";1958;5.73407;1.2222

2494;Hispania;"Hispania gives four to five players a chance to re-enact this dramatic period of history. It sets out from the arrival of Carthage in the fourth century BC, follows the footsteps of Roman, Germanic, Byzantine and Muslim conquerors, and finally takes part in the early reconquista of the Christian kingdoms of Castile, Leon, Aragon and Portugal.&#10;&#10;Hispania adapts the basic system of Britannia and re-locates it to Ancient / early Medieval Spain and Portugal, adding and changing some rules along the way. The actual time period covered is 320 BC to 1220 AD.&#10;&#10;In Hispania advanced rules, the players try to outbid each other in an auction for up to 30 different tribes and peoples. The auction system guarantees that each game is quite unlike the previous one. Each time the players lead different peoples and adjust to their respective victory conditions, all of which have been modeled on historical requirements.&#10;&#10;Special unit types include Knights, Castles and Elites. Several nations undergo transformations, for example the Romans becoming Hispano-Romans. Naval invasions are allowed for some powers.&#10;&#10;The game includes:&#10;&#10;    640 counters (4 countersheets)&#10;    1 map (84 x 59 cm - 33 x 23.2 in) - Azure Wish version has a 1994 or 1996 edition map&#10;    1 rule booklet (24 pages)&#10;    5 scenarios:&#10;        320 BC to 961 AD (13 turns)&#10;        205 BC to 1030 AD (12 turns)&#10;        205 BC to 1100 AD (16 turns)&#10;        320 BC to 1100 AD (19 turns)&#10;        320 BC to 1220 AD (21 turns)&#10;    &#10;    4 player's aids&#10;    2 dices (10 sided)&#10;&#10;&#10;(source: adapted from the back of the box, Azure Wish edition)&#10;&#10;";1994;6.7797;3.0556
2496;Saloon;"Premiering at Essen 2001, a card game of brawling in a Saloon of the Old West. The attacker plays his cards and the defender responds.  The first noninvolved player to get a card to the table can throw in a punch as well.  If any of the attack gets through, the defender takes some knock out points.  But if he's not yet in Dreamland, now he gets the turn to strike back, or does he find a new target?  Plenty of warping effects on these easy-to-explain rules and interesting flavor are added by cards such as the roundhouse, whiskey bottle, flying through the window, beer barrel, piano player, Oopsadaisy and the dreaded bartender (he comes with a club).  Players gradually get knocked out until there is only one brawler left standing, the winner.&#10;&#10;Components include 6 Schl&auml;ger [&quot;Brawler&quot;] cards (one for each player), 54 Saloon cards (24 Attack cards, 8 Item cards, 6 Hit cards, 3 Help cards, 8 Defense cards, 5 Event cards).&#10;&#10;";2001;5.02632;1.0625

2500;Express Chess;"Based on when Blackbox originally put it out, this could be considered Chess's answer to collectible card games.  Cards represent typical chess pieces, and the board is defined by the rows of cards originally laid out.  Throughout the game players capture each others' pieces as in normal chess, but can continually add to the board from the cards they hold in their hands.&#10;&#10;Additional rules, such as the pawn combo (after moving a pawn, you can make a second move through or into the vacated space), add new elements over classic chess.  Pawn combos together with piece limits and placement restrictions serve to balance the value of the different pieces.  A small number of cards have special powers on them, further changing the rules of the game.&#10;&#10;";1996;4.76885;1.0

2510;Playboss;"Playboss is an exciting board-game that simulates the many real-life business situations in which directors and managers make their decisions. Each player in this game is a businessman who has the opportunity of buying machines and raw materials, selling his products, paying taxes, raising loans or introducing rationalization schemes, and generally experiencing the ups and downs of everyday business life.&#10;&#10;Before starting, players agree the duration of the game. The player with the greatest net assets at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;The board comprises a circuit of 42 spaces of 5 different types: decision spaces on which the player can choose to buy raw material, purchase capital equipment, manufacture goods or sell goods, research &amp; development spaces which allow investment for productivity improvement or risk reduction, risk spaces which require the drawing of a risk card, additional cost spaces, and depreciation spaces.&#10;&#10;Each player has a factory card on which are placed machines, computers, raw materials and finished goods.

2514;Skyline;"Players take turns moving their own Helicopter pawn around the board to land on an unoccupied square. Individual board squares may be colored to match one player&rsquo;s color, or in a neutral color. The color of the landing site indicates which player (whether or not that is the active player) places one floor of a new building at this square.&#10;&#10;The active player must then pay points to owners of all buildings over which the Helicopter has just flown. The pay rate is based on the total floor count for each color involved, and escalates steeply with increased floor count.&#10;&#10;Turn ends with one additional floor of the appropriate color being added to each building flown over.&#10;&#10;Some players may be eliminated early when unable to pay.  Game ends when one player cannot move (cannot reach an empty square), or when one player has no more floors to place.  Player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;";1988;4.79032;2.5
2516;Man O' War;"Man O' War is the game of Raging Sea Battles in the Warhammer World. As an admiral of an ocean-going war fleet you must command your ships - which can be either squadrons of Ships of the Line or heavily armored Men O' War and Independents, in the battle for supremacy of the high seas.&#10;&#10;Players choose fleets from the multitude of races of the Warhammer world. Every ship is represented by a template showing individual areas, each with a description of the items (masts, cannons etc.) in those areas - as well as the damage that they can take before being destroyed. Each location has a value that must be rolled to hit that area when attacked, along with another value that can be rolled by the defending player to possibly prevent any damage that might occur. Ships are classified one of three ways. They are either Ship of the Line (SOL) - which are designed to move as a group of three (each moving and fighting to completion before continuing on with the next ship in the squadron), a Man O' War (MOW)- which are single ships that are much larger, more powerful and crewed by larger numbers than a single SOL classed ship, or finally as an Independent (IND) - which are used individually like a Man O' War but are more in line in strength and abilities to that of a Ship of the Line.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each turn, players determine Initiative by each rolling a die which determines who will go 1st in each phase - if the numbers are different, or how the wind direction changes if they both roll the same number. If the wind changes, the initiative roll and resolution is repeated until one player wins the die roll.&#10;&#10;Players then conduct the Magic Phase with each Admiral having his Wizard make one spell attempt if desired based on the Initiative order previously determined. If a spell is successful, the other player can try and dispel that spell just cast - but only if they have a corresponding type of magic to make the attempt.&#10;&#10;Next comes the Battle phase - which is also based on the previously determined initiative roll. Players alternate between phases of Movement/Combat, each choosing a single MOW, IND or SOL Squadron and then conducting movement (if desired) and/or making attacks, before passing the turn sequence back to their opponent. This process continues until all ships have been activated on both sides. Once that has occurred, the turn is over and a series of quick turn ending/record keeping events occurs before moving to the next turn. Game play continues for a predetermined time or until one side is destroyed, surrenders or flees the battlefield.&#10;&#10;The Main Boxed set contained 2 sets of 3 Wargalleys for the Empire and another 2 sets of 3 Wargalleys that were considered Pirates. THe main rules also included Fleet Lists and specific rules for each of the 6 Warhammer Races included in the game: The Imperial (Empire), Bretonnian, Dwarf, High Elf, Dark Elf and Orc. Each Race had had unique features, weapons and abilities that made every battle a new challenge for both players. Rules for a Campaign as well as additional pieces like playing pieces like Shoreforts were also included in the main ruleset.&#10;&#10;There were two separate expansions to the main game. The first was Plaguefleet which added rules and templates for the Chaos fleets of Khorne, Slaanesh, Tzeentch and Nurgle (collectively known as a Plaguefleet), the Skaven and finally the Chaos Dwarfs. This expansion effectively doubled the number of available fleets for the game. This expansion also included color templates for the original 6 races as well (Imperial, Bretonnian, Dwarf, High Elf, Dark Elf and Orc).&#10;&#10;The 2nd expansion Sea of Blood mainly introduced new rules for Airpower, Sea Monsters &amp; Beasts and Allies as well as new ships for the Dwarfs and Imperial fleets. The inclusion of the Norse fleet wrapped up the content for this expansion.&#10;&#10;Finally, complete rules for an Undead fleet - as well as some expansion rules for a few of the other races, were included in several of the issues of Game Workshop's Citadel Journal magazine.&#10;&#10;A wide variety of miniatures were produced to represent the many ships detailed in the main game and expansion sets but no miniatures were ever officially made for the Undead fleet. Assembling and painting the miniatures gave the game a feeling of being &quot;collectible&quot; as well as being a hobby in itself. Many players have created customized ships and new ships (and even complete fleets) including rules, ships templates and completed miniatures. The largest collection of these creations is housed at Groups IO and there is a very active Facebook Page as well.&#10;&#10;Man O War is still considered by many GW fan's as one of Games Workshop's best games. The wide variety of different ships, rules for each race and relatively small investment to get up and running contributed greatly to Man O War's popularity. Even today, fans scramble to find copies of the games and with the rise in accessibility to 3D printing, getting a fleet (or two) for this out of print game has never been easier.&#10;&#10;";1993;7.18083;2.6613
2518;Quicksand;"The object of the game is to be the first player to get your adventurer around the board from START to the finish line back at CAMP.&#10;&#10;Along the way, you&rsquo;ll encounter Mudslides that may set you back and hanging vines that may swing you ahead.  You&rsquo;ll try to grab onto Handholds and land on Safe Rocks to keep your man high and dry.  Because all along the track, Quicksand pits lie in wait to suck your adventurer down, down, down --piece by piece by piece!  And you&rsquo;ll always keep an eye out for the sneaky Alligator that lurks in the swamp --and on the special Quicksand die-- ready to scare an unlucky player backwards on the track.&#10;&#10;The player pawns represent a mustachioed archetypical British explorer, and they're in parts.  To represent your sinking into the quicksand, you remove his feet, then his waist, and so on until only the pith helmet remains!&#10;&#10;You actually start already partially mired (by an initial die roll); every turn you move forward a number of spaces given by your height, plus an optional movement die.

2524;StarForce 'Alpha Centauri': Interstellar Conflict in the 25th Century;"Adapted from the box:&#10;&#10;The game is a simulation of events within a conjectural future history in which telekinesis is used to move ships through space. It is played on a map which displays 74 star systems in a three-dimensional &quot;sphere&quot; of space measuring roughly 40 light years in diameter, with Earth's home system at the center. A grid of hexagons printed over the map is used to regulate movement and position of pieces.  Pieces' exact locations are not known until they &quot;meet&quot; in the same three-dimensional &quot;hex space&quot;.&#10;&#10;The pieces in the game represent groups of four interstellar spaceships (StarForces) and space stations (StarGates). Each Player maneuvers his pieces (via Stellar Shifting) to engage those of the enemy. Movement is plotted and executed simultaneously. The game proceeds this way (for a specified number of turns) as the players try to achieve the objectives set forth in the rules. No prior knowledge is required to play the game - just a little ingenuity and common sense.&#10;&#10;Battles take place when units are in the same three-dimensional location.  In the Basic Game, the attacking Player compares the total variable strengths of the involved units and consults a simple probability table to determine the outcome of each battle.  In the Advanced Game, a small tactical maneuver map is used. When enemy forces engage on the main map, they are transferred to the tactical display. Here they move (in three dimensions), attack and defend using a fixed number of action points per tactical turn.&#10;&#10;Combat outcomes result in pieces not being destroyed but being &quot;randomised&quot;; usually to a location far from all the action.&#10;&#10;&#10;Part of the StarForce Trilogy box set, along with Outreach and StarSoldier. There are also special rules to use Starsoldier as a tactical game for StarForce.&#10;&#10;";1974;6.4098;3.4444

2538;Viceroys;"This wargame details the worldwide European explorations and colonizations of the 15th and 16th centuries.&#10;The map is directly based on a &quot;wrong&quot; historical map. Event cards seem to cover just about every dimension of the period. The underlying game system also offers opportunity for strategy and negotiation as well as chaos. The seagoing players, Portugal, Spain, England, France, and the Dutch, each have national differences and advantages/disadvantages.  This is also true for Russia and Turkey which can colonize overland. There is also provision for general European war.  Multiple scenarios are provided. Also included are rules for 1 or 2 players which permit Spain and Portugal to participate as non-players.&#10;&#10;One interesting dimension of the game is the idea that each player also has a &quot;job&quot; within the game, from which he occasionally earns a little income.  One of them was even The Rules Lawyer, in charge of resolving any disputes!&#10;&#10;In 1992, expanded to support 8 players, including China, with the Columbus expansion kit commemorating the 500th anniversary of Columbus' initial voyage.&#10;&#10;";1986;6.47568;3.2963

2542;Gargon;"Contents - one deck of 102 Gargon cards in 6 suits, plus 18 bonus cards. One rulebook.&#10;&#10;Gargon is fantasy themed card game for 3-5 players. There are 6 suits of Gargon cards, each representing a fantasy creature, with values 0 to 15. The cards also show amulet symbols, with the low value cards having more, the highest value cards having none. At the end of the game, the player who has won the most cards in each suit gets a bonus card worth ten points, or five points if tied - this is what the 18 bonus cards are for. Each amulet is also worth one point. The zero value cards have no amulets themselves, but double the amulet count for that suit, or quadruple them if both 0 value cards in that suit have been won.&#10;&#10;Ten cards are dealt to each player, and the rest are split into two equal draw piles, face down, in the center of the board. The draw piles are spread out so that the backs can be seen, showing the color of the suits. Players must also hold their cards so that the backs are visible.&#10;&#10;Each round the start player plays up to three cards face down, (but never three of the same suit), and the other players must follow in turn with the same number of cards in the same distribution, or pass. There is no requirement to follow suit in general, but if, for example, the start player puts down three cards in three different suits, the other players must also play three cards in three different suits. The last player is restricted to suits that have already been played. Anybody who passed draws 1-3 cards from the two draw piles in the center. A battle is then resolved for each suit that has been played, with the highest card winning the battle and going into its owner&rsquo;s stash of Gargon cards to be scored at the end. The losing cards are discarded and the players draw replacements.&#10;&#10;If anybody played two cards of a suit, a second battle is fought with the weakest of the pair.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one of the draw piles is exhausted, and the current round is played out, then the totals are scored.&#10;&#10;";2001;5.98267;1.7463

The object of the game is to collect all three parts of the Elixir of Life.&#10;&#10;Trouble is, no one knows the Elixir's secret formula when the game begins.  To discover it, you must experiment by brewing different ingredients together.  The gameboard includes three shops full of ingredients: Special Supplies, the Herbalist, and the Jeweller's.  During play, you move around the board, buy ingredients from the shops, and take them back to your lab to brew a potion.&#10;&#10;A potion has at least three ingredients: 1 special supply, 1 herb, and 1 or more gems.  The result is either part of the Elixir or another potion that can help wizards during play.  For example, Speedy Soda lets you move around the board faster.&#10;&#10;Beware of the street.

2548;Loopino;"A card-flicking card game in which a target card depicting some tasty fish is placed on the table and players attempt to flick (actually, according to the rules, this is a wrist-toss rather than a finger-flick) cards depicting dolphins as close to the target as possible - the twisting motion of the flicked cards is supposed to represent the playful antics of the dolphins. A crosshair appears in the corner of each card, and distance is measured by the closest crosshair on the flicked card in relation to the closest crosshair on the target card. The number of cards to be scored is determined by the number on the closest card to the target (i.e. if a &quot;4&quot; card is closest to the target, the four closest cards all will score). Each card scores a number of points equal to the face value of the card multiplied by the number of crosshair symbols on the card that remain uncovered. If all four crosshairs on the target are covered, the player covering the last takes a penalty, as does any player causing the target card to fall off the table. Suggested game duration is as many rounds as the number of players; highest point total wins.&#10;&#10;";1997;4.09524;1.0

All cards are displayed where everyone can see them.&#10;&#10;During each players turn, he controls Snarf (represented by the supplied miniature) and his actions.

Activated cards can help you or hurt your opponents, depending on what happens in the storyline. At the end of the game, the player with the most Treasure Points, Wins.&#10;&#10;The basic game comes with 50 cards, a snarf miniature and is made for 2 to 3 players. However, with each additional 20 cards you add to your deck, one more player can be added. 5 is the recommended maximum. 20 card expansion sets can be purchased that also include a new miniature. Each of these expansions is based around a different character from the Snarf Quest comic strip. This is not a collectable card game, all starter and expansion decks are identical.&#10;&#10;In 2003 the game was reproduced as a new version of the game which comes with a 100-card deck and one Snarf miniature.

2558;Comeback;"Another in the line of very small card games by Reinhard Staupe. The deck consists of four suits of cards numbered 1 to 7. The 1s have three stars, the 2s have two stars and all other cards have one star. Players start with 150 points (which serves as a starting score and a money pool for bidding). For 2 players, use 16 cards, for 3 players use 21 cards, for 4 players use 24 cards (so that players do not know which cards are in play) and these are auctioned off one at a time. Bid increments must be at least as great as the number of the card being auctioned but can be more - i.e. while bidding on a card with the number 4, a bid of four would require a bid of 8 or more from the next bidder). The first bid can be lower, the same or higher than the number of the card.  Bidding goes clockwise around the table.  First bid also moves clockwise around the table. When all cards have been auctioned, suits are scored separately for each player by adding the card numbers and multiplying that figure by the total number of stars in the suit. Scores for each suit are added to any remaining points from a players' starting pool (points remaining from the original pool of 150) to determine the final score. Comeback was nominated for Spiel des Jahres in Germany in 1997.&#10;&#10;";1996;5.88372;1.6

2574;Classic Warlord;"Originally self published by Mike Hayes in 1974 as &quot;The Warlord&quot; - this edition came in a red box.  It was reprinted by Mike in 1978 as &quot;Warlord&quot; and came in a blue box.  It was released by Games Workshop in 1980 in a smaller version (only western half of the Warlord board) as &quot;Apocalypse&quot;.&#10;&#10;As of October 2012, the game is now available again as Classic Warlord, a limited edition in a gold box, with two sets of rules and an FAQ booklet, counters in pouches for up to seven players and a single large D6, along with the full eight-section mapboard. This version sees the game revert back to the original Warlord with new rules to reflect over thirty years of play.&#10;&#10;Objective - to dominate the board and destroy opponents.&#10;&#10;Mechanics - similar to Risk, you get more armies for the more territories you hold. Allocation is on basis of territory held: city, industrial or agricultural.  Mountainous, waste, and sea spaces gain you no armies.&#10;&#10;Gaining territories through combat is an elegant use of cunning and bluff.  Instead of rolling dice, the attacker simply chooses with a single D6 how many pieces they wish to attack with (subject to restrictions based on terrain).  The D6 is then concealed and the defender attempts to guess it.  If they guess correctly the attacker loses that number of armies; if they guess wrongly one defender is lost, and if the territory is now left unoccupied the selected number of attacking pieces or greater are advanced into the territory to capture it.&#10;&#10;Alliances are allowed (and can be broken at will).&#10;&#10;A-bombs and the more devastating H-bombs are used in the game.  A-bombs are a reward for successful combat, and H-bombs are gained as a result of launching an A-bomb.  These can be placed to act as deterrents against other players, and can be launched to clear enemy territory prior to an advance.  Nuclear damage however will render map spaces impassable for the remainder of the game.&#10;&#10;";2012;7.17318;2.2619

2580;Persian Gulf: Battle for the Middle East;"Persian Gulf: Battle for the Middle East:&#10;&#10;Persian Gulf uses the same rules as the other games in the Third World War series to show a different aspect of modern warfare operations in the deserts and mountains of the middle east.&#10;&#10;Persian Gulf includes a special &quot;game within a game&quot;, covering the diplomatic, political, and military maneuvers by the Soviet Union and the United States in the Middle East before - and leading to - the general outbreak of the Third World War. Both sides try to gain control of the various Iranian factions and influence the other Middle Eastern nations. As the superpowers' confrontation continues, fighting breaks out between committed factions. Either side can decide to send troops to support their factions; the U.S. may send the Rapid Deployment Force while the Soviet Union may use its forces along its southern borders and in Afghanistan. Each move, however, escalates the conflict until the superpowers are directly fighting one another in the Middle East and their alliances in Europe are mobilizing for war.&#10;&#10;The four game maps cover the Persian Gulf region in detail. Centered on Iran and Iraq, the maps include bordering areas of Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the USSR, and Afghanistan. Mountains and sand dominate this area of the world, and wilderness rules show the effects of the scarcity of roads on military operations. &#10;Vying for control of the nations on these maps are the regional forces and those of the superpowers. These forces range greatly in capabilities: from the poorly-equipped and trained Iranian Revolutionary Guards and Soviet-controlled Afghan Army to the capable Turks to the elite Israeli and Jordanian intervention contingents. The Soviets have large forces available in their southern border regions and in Afghanistan. The small but strong U.S. RDF is on hand, and they can call on B-52 strikes for support.&#10;&#10;The rules cover the special political and military situations of the Middle East and the various Arab and Arab-Israeli rivalries are shown. Victory conditions take account of the oil resources of the Gulf. Additional rules allow Persian Gulf to be combined and played with the other three games in the Third World War series.&#10;&#10;";1986;7.40206;3.4815

2596;Villa Paletti;"An architectural rush to the skies for 2 - 4 budding architects with a good head for heights from 8 years old.&#10;&#10;In the land where the Lemons bloom, there once lived a wise old sage, whose friends called him &quot;Paletti&quot; He only had one goal in life, to finish the wonderful castle in the sky that his grandfather had begun to build many years before, but which had been left unfinished when the ducats ran out. Paletti too had little money, but instead he had a marvelous plan. Why buy new columns when he could re-use the old ones that his Grandfather had built?  All he needed to do was remove some of those holding up the first floor, of which there were far too many in any case, and rebuild them further up, so that they could support new floors,  reaching up towards the skies!&#10;&#10;&quot;Excellent, Paletti&quot; shouted his friends, and they quickly started to work.  Soon they had a marvelous building in front of them, the &quot;Villa Paletti&quot;. Nowadays, no one knows what it was caused the collapse of the Vila Paletti, perhaps a puff of wind, or a slight earth tremor, but all the experts are united on one point, that Paletti,  far ahead of his time, was the first to discover something whose full importance is only now starting to become clear to us, the Euro pallet!&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Palazzo Paletti&#10;    Menara&#10;&#10;&#10;";2001;6.41571;1.1603
2598;Tank Battle;"The object of this game (a distant relative of Stratego) is to destroy your opponent's six tanks before he does the same to you.  In addition to your tanks, you deploy an Ammo Dump, a Fuel Dump, your HQ and five Anti-Tank guns (which do not move).&#10;&#10;Your tanks are numbered but the opponent knows not which is which.  You also deploy (by writing their coordinates on a scrap of paper) two land mines.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you first plot secretly (using a peg board) where you think your opponent's tanks will end their move.  Once you're ready, he moves.  If you guessed correctly, the tanks are killed.  (You get six such shots each turn)  You also have five special shots which can be fired only once each --they may be added piecemeal during any turn.  You lose a special shot whenever you lose an AT gun.&#10;&#10;You have 6 moves each turn, no more than 3 per tank (unless down to two or fewer tanks).  Tanks can only go sideways or forward but those that reach the opponent's starting row are marked with a flag and can now move backward.&#10;&#10;Tanks attack each other by orthogonal proximity, in Stratego fashion (higher numbered tank wins).  Tanks attack AT guns using a spinner.  The installations are destroyed by being overrun.  Losing the HQ clears your mines; losing the Ammo Dump means you only use as many pegs as you have tanks remaining; losing the Fuel Dump reduces your movement points from six to four.  Tanks die if they end up on an enemy mine square.&#10;&#10;Remade in to Mission Command Land&#10;&#10;";1975;5.53652;1.6458

2602;Solitaire for Two;"Solitaire for Two includes two games: one called Six-Suit Solitaire that was originally released as Indochine 2000, and a second titled Solitaire for Two that (despite the title) can be played with 2-4 players.&#10;&#10;Six-Suit Solitaire is a modified version of the solitaire game Klondike, with six suits in the game instead of four as well as three jokers (one in each color). As in Klondike, players try to remove all tiles from play by creating stacks from Ace to King, but unlike in Klondike players have an incentive to keep Aces in play rather than removing them; if a player has one Ace in play, then he can move Queens to empty columns in addition to Kings, and with two or more Aces in play he can also move Jacks to empty columns. A player can place only the rightmost tile in the &quot;talon&quot; &ndash; the row of exposed tiles from the stock &ndash; but if he cashes in a joker, he can move any tile in the talon to the rightmost position.&#10;&#10;Solitaire for Two plays similarly to Six-Suit Solitaire, but the players take turns drawing tiles from the stock &ndash; three at a time &ndash; and trying to place them in the layout and score as many tiles as possible. Players score points for each tile they lay off; for playing all three tiles drawn; for moving columns of five, seven, nine or eleven tiles; and for other specialized situations. The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;";2001;6.67939;2.2
2604;Compatibility;"Play is in teams of two. Each person has a deck of picture cards. Each deck has the same set of pictures. There is also a deck of word cards with words like &quot;marriage&quot;, &quot;de facto&quot;, and &quot;pimple&quot;.&#10;&#10;A word is chosen and each player chooses 2-5 cards from his/her deck. Teams score points for choosing the same pictures, and score extra points for putting the pictures in the same order (from most to least important).&#10;&#10;The board is used to keep track of the score, and to dictate how many pictures a team may select. First team to the end wins.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Compatibility 15th Anniversary Edition&#10;&#10;&#10;";1996;6.57358;1.1096
2606;Dover Patrol;"This game DOVER PATROL by Harry Gibson is a wonderful Naval themed and early version of a type of hidden tactics game of skill. It was sold alongside the similar L'Attaque and Aviation: The Aerial Tactics Game of Attack and Defence and a more complicated game called Tri-Tactics designed as an incorporation of all three, by Gibsons and marketed together at the time as Series: The Big Four (Gibsons).&#10;&#10;Note: L'Attaque was patented in 1909 in France by Mademoiselle Hermance Edan, the U.K. distribution rights for which were acquired in 1925 by Gibsons. Dover Patrol was launched in 1911, whereas the original H. P. Gibson & Sons company was registered in 1919. Prior to that, The International Card Company operated between 1903 and 1919, when Harry Percy Gibson purchased ICC to form his company. Whether Harry Gibson designed the game is therefore open to some doubt.&#10;&#10;The game play of Dover Patrol is very much like L'Attaque, which forms the basis of the near-identical game Stratego by Jumbo, published in 1946 after World War II when the patent would have expired. Gibsons themselves had to effectively &lsquo;start again&rsquo; around that time having had their premises destroyed in the Blitz.&#10;&#10;The board, which supposedly represents an area of sea, is superimposed with a rectangular grid. A Base is shown on two of the opposite edges of the board. The area round each base is protected by a harbour wall.&#10;&#10;Each player has a fleet of forty playing pieces. These pieces are rectangles of cardboard which stand upon plastic supports. The two sides are distinguished by the colour on the back of each card, red and blue in this case. The fronts of the cards depict various ships, mines and a flying boat. Each piece has a printed value from 1 for a Patrol Vessel to 10 for the Flagship. These values represent the relative strength of each ship and also indicate the type of ship; battle cruisers, light cruisers, etc.. The ships are also named, H.M.S. Lion, H.M.S. Glasgow and so on. The object of the game is to capture the enemy Flag and transport it back to one's own base while still retaining possession of one's own Flag.&#10;&#10;To start the game, the players place their Flag on their Base and then set up their pieces, one per rectangle, on their own side of the board and with the backs of the cards facing the opponent. In turn the players move a piece one space orthogonally until two opposing pieces are back-to-back. The moving player may then call 'Attack', the two relevant pieces are then revealed and the one with the lower value is sunk and removed from the board.&#10;&#10;In addition to the fighting ships, the players have a number of auxiliary pieces. Mines will automatically blow up virtually all ships that are moved into an attacking position, regardless of whether the owner of the moving ship attacks or not. Once placed, mines may not be moved. Only the mine sweepers can destroy mines. The mine layers act as floating mines. They can be moved but may not attack, but have the same effect upon enemy shipping as a mine. Only the destroyers can sink them. Submarines have a marauding role and can sink all ships except mine layers and MTB's. The good old flying boat has a very important role as it is principally used to capture the enemy flag because it can fly over the harbour walls. Only MTB's and destroyers can shoot it down. When the opposing flag is captured, it is clipped to the top of the capturing piece and thus its whereabouts are known to all. The Flag can be transferred to any other piece standing orthogonally adjacent to the piece which is transporting it.&#10;&#10;It is a fairly straightforward game to play, though tactics can well be employed, particularly in the setting up phase.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    L'Attaque&#10;    Aviation: The Aerial Tactics Game of Attack and Defence&#10;    Tri-Tactics&#10;    Stratego&#10;&#10;&#10;";1919;6.19028;2.1111
2608;King Oil;"This MB game comes with a plastic &quot;board&quot;.  Its size is dictated by the three randomizing discs embedded in its base, which are used to generate a new playing area every time (there are 1,728 (12^3) different setups possible).&#10;&#10;You buy properties, drill for oil, link properties with pipelines so as to collect royalties and try to be the richest player.  Event cards complicate matters.  Drilling is resolved with a little rig whose plunger is pushed up if it doesn't go through the hidden disc; if it pushes through all three, the well is dry.  Deeper holes cost more, of course.&#10;&#10;Pipelines can be bought once you have 4 producing oil wells on a property; they reach across that property's boundary to another player's property, and are used to siphon royalties from him every turn.  This is a clever mechanic that accelerates bankruptcy and keeps total playing time within reasonable limits.&#10;&#10;Once all players but one are pushed into bankruptcy, the remaining one is the winner.&#10;&#10;";1974;6.10175;1.6585

2618;WestwÃ¤rts;"On his last long ride through the wide and wild West, the experienced expedition leader McTrucker realizes that he's getting too old for the job &ndash; but who will take his place? One of the greenhorns accompanying the current expedition?&#10;&#10;To find out which of these greenhorns might be best for the job, McTrucker gives each of them a mission on the final day of the expedition &ndash; and to make sure he finds out how they fare against one another, the missions all bring them into competition with one another. Only the one who can enforce his will best over the others and best deal with unexpected situations will merit being appointed expedition leader.&#10;&#10;To set up Westw&auml;rts, twenty wagon cards &ndash; along with settlers, gold mines and even a scout, barber, preacher, teacher, cook and gravedigger &ndash; are placed beside a munitions wagon. Five cards each are randomly distributed on four area cards (pastureland, desert, Indian country and mountain country). Thirty job cards can be completed, four of which are laid out face-up with a reward of 1-3 gold nuggets for each when completed.&#10;&#10;The progress of the wagon train is controlled by cards, with each player holding three in hand. While game flow is simple, fulfilling demands is not always so. Each player places a movement card face down. The current player reveals his own and that of another. With these two cards, he then resolves the wagon train movements and tries to fulfill jobs. The game ends when a player has earned 15 nuggets or fewer than four incomplete jobs remain. Some jobs are simple with small payoffs while a more difficult one would require, for example, equipping one area with three settlers and two gold diggers or placing the preacher between a settler and a gold digger. In such cases, often the second card is of no help unless players make special arrangements with one another: You scratch my back, I scratch yours. Special cards do things like eliminate or paralyze certain wagons due to fire or broken axles.&#10;&#10;";1995;5.16667;0.0
2620;Schwimmer in der WÃ¼ste;"In English the title means Swimmers in the Desert which for some will give away the &quot;setting&quot; as that of the novel and film, THE ENGLISH PATIENT.  The situation is that of the beginning of the film.  Players secretly place swimmers on individual boards with the aim of recreating the exact placement of the swimmers on the game board.&#10;&#10;The game is played with 19 small rocks in grey, brown, yellow or white and beautiful handmade materials, and is performed in two parts.  During the first part the stones are placed onto the playing field via auctions.  Two stones at a time are drawn from the bag and auctioned by having each player bidding using one big and one small card.  The small cards have a value from 1 to 3, the big from 1 to 12.  The player with the highest product of the two cards may place both stones onto the board.  The big card is removed from the game, the small card will stay open until the last card of the same type is played.   Only after 3 bidding rounds will you get more small cards in your hand.&#10;&#10;The idea is to place the stones in the right order, which is stated on the card you have hidden from your opponents. You may score a row or column five times during the game even when it isn't your turn. When both color and position match you you place a so-called &quot;2F&quot; or &quot;3F&quot; marker at the row/column which will bring you 2 or 3 points for each correct stone - which can amount to quite a good score in the long 5 stone row. If only the color, but not the position, is correct you use the &quot;2A&quot; or &quot;1A&quot; markers.  One or two points per stone won't get you far, especially in the short 3-stone row, but the most important aspect is not to use the markers too soon.  Firstly, because you cannot score a particular row/column more than once, secondly because you can get your points in the second half of the game.&#10;&#10;When all stones have been placed onto the board the second half of the game beings.  Here you may rearrange the stones. Before the game is over you may you exchange two stones with each other five times.  You shouldn't use your 2- or 3-marker on the short rows/columns, but rather concentrate on the longer. The board has two 5-, four 4- and four 3-rows, and if you don't get the maximum points early in the game will you have to look foolishly on as your opponent places his markers on the two 5- and three of the 4-rows to score maximum points.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.0;0.0

He gets all the dice and rolls the black dice first.  He selects one of the dice and moves his pawn according to the number shown. Afterwards the second player takes one of the remaining dice and moves his pawn. Then the third player follows, etc.  The last player in a round must take the last remaining die.&#10;&#10;Once all players have moved the start player rolls the large white die and move the Phantom accordingly.&#10;&#10;Then all the dice are passed to the next player in a clockwise direction who follows the same procedure.&#10;&#10;The Phantom&#10;The player who rolled the black dice in this round moves the Phantom.  After all players finish their turns with the black die, he rolls the white die and moves the Phantom in any direction.  Afterwards the next player in a clockwise direction receives all the dice and the next round begins.&#10;&#10;How Does the Phantom Move?&#10;The Phantom leaves his Start place in any direction.&#10;The Phantom may land on and over wall spaces and can also stop there. Phantom can move through rooms. It enters and leaves a room from any space.  The room represents a space and costs one point of movement.  The Phantom may not enter the End Space or a Violin Space.  He also may not move over them.&#10;&#10;The White Phantom Die&#10;It shows 1 - 5 pips and a Phantom.  The pips mean that the Phantom is moved a corresponding number of fields. If the white die shows the Phantom, the Phantom must be moved into an arbitrary room.  Then the player throws the white die one more time and the Phantom moves that number of spaces from the new room. The Phantom is an Obstacle. No pawn may land on or pass through a space that the Phantom is standing on.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the player that possesses a Violin and the required number of Roses can enter the End space.  A player that reaches it only by exact count is the winner.&#10;&#10;";1993;5.13158;1.25

2638;Clash of Giants: Campaigns of Tannenberg and the Marne, 1914;"Clash of Giants contains two separate games (both using the same basic system) covering the two most famous battles of the opening phase of the First World War. Tannenberg was the German victory that halted a Russian offensive into East Prussia and destroyed the Russian 2nd Army. The Marne was the climactic battle of Germany's attempt to defeat France in the war's first six weeks. Arguably a tactical draw, it was a strategic defeat for the Germans as their armies recoiled from the gates of Paris.&#10;&#10;Designed by eight-time Charles S. Roberts award winner Ted S. Raicer (whose most recent game was GMT's Paths of Glory), and developed by Krieg designer Steve Kosakowski, the Clash of Giants system is intended to emphasize playability while still providing players with proper historical feel. The games focus on the difficulty of commanding groups of armies, with a system where movement allowance for each army is separately determined by a command roll.&#10;&#10;Clash of Giants includes the standard and exclusive rules (including rules for Paris Taxis at the Marne and Geman wireless intercepts at Tannenberg), two full size large-hex maps, two player aid cards, and 264 large counters. Units are divisions and brigades.&#10;&#10;Simple but not simplistic, Clash of Giants has a unique combat system based more on a unit's training, equipment, and morale than numbers. In Tannenberg, the victory conditions force both sides to take risks - and the German player will have to use every advantage to avoid being crushed by superior Russian numbers.

2640;Babylon 5 Collectible Card Game;"Based on J. Michael Straczynski's popular SF series (including the short-lived spin-off, &quot;Crusade&quot;), this CCG with a story-telling flavor deserves its fan following. Precedence lost the rights from Warner Brothers and Crusade was their final expansion set; the game was produced from 1997 until 2001 and is still supported by numerous fan web sites.&#10;&#10;The Babylon 5 CCG is for two to five players (or more, using the alternate faction rules). Each player chooses a different Race (Narn, Centauri, Minbari, Human, etc.) and is in control of the ambassador of this race. With this ambassador you will build a Faction, then set an Agenda for your Faction to pursue. By fulfilling your Faction's Agenda and accumulating Power, you will lead your race to a position of dominance and win the game. You may recruit allies (character cards) from among the other races, or try to rely only on your own people.&#10;&#10;Will you use diplomacy, intrigue or military conquest as your stepping stones to power? Will you rise to dominance on your own merits, or will you seek the aid of an elder race, like the Shadows? If you do, beware, for there may be a price!

2642;Frontrunner;"A &quot;humorous&quot; political board game in which players are candidates for the nation's highest office. Players must choose which states to campaign in, how you will spend your $30 Million dollar campaign budget, how to fend off the attacks of opponents, and how to avoid career-ending scandals. The game stresses the humorous side of presidential politics through the use of political cartoons. &quot;Media Cards&quot; feature the headlines of real-life prominent daily national newspapers (such as the Arizona Republic, Washington Post, Detroit Free Press, Chicago Sun Times, etc). &quot;State Cards&quot; feature historic and geographic highlights of each state. The game lasts through 30 days (turns) of a campaign (or 15 days for shorter games). The winner is determined by which player has the most Electoral Votes (out of the 538 actual votes).&#10;The game was updated in 1994 with minor changes to the rules.&#10;&#10;";1992;3.75;0.0
2644;Who Framed Roger Rabbit?;"Based on the movie, this game's object is to discover your opponents' identities, find the Will and return to your home space.&#10;&#10;On your move, you roll two dice (black and white); you move as indicated by the white die (1-6), adding the black die (1-3) if you choose to.  Movement around the board can be accelerated by the Trolley or by Benny the taxi cab (each uses his own special die to move, which boils down to a 1 in 6 chance of stopping --this mechanic pervades the game as you'll see).&#10;&#10;Identities can be guessed by looking at cards set up on the board; each shows half a character's picture, in a player colour.  Once you've seen both halves of a given colour, you're allowed to guess that character as that player's identity.  Each correct guess allows a search for the Will, checking the Confidential cards that lie on the Dip Cannon circle.  Once a player has grabbed the Will, the others go after him and forget about identity-guessing.&#10;&#10;You can steal the Will by Dip Cannonning the Will-holder, by sending a Weasel after him or by landing on him by exact count.  To use th Dip Cannon, you use your (one and only) Dip Cannon card or one of the Judge Doom cards you've previously found, then roll the Dip Cannon die.  Each &quot;Dip&quot; rolled turns the cannon one space towards your target; the &quot;cancel dip&quot; die face stops the process altogether.  If you successfully Dip him, he drops the Will and is sent back to any home space.  Weasels work in similar fashion, the Weasel token starting beside your token and moving towards its quarry with each successful weasel die throw.  Used Weasel cards may be recovered by landing on a special space in the Dip Cannon circle.&#10;&#10;";1987;5.06429;1.5

2652;Wise and Otherwise;"Aptly described as Confucius plays Balderdash.&#10;&#10;One player is designated as the Reader each round. That player reads the first part of an old saying or proverb to the group, and states the country of origin for that proverb. The remaining players must secretly write an ending for the proverb and pass it to the Reader, who collects all possible endings.&#10;&#10;The Reader shuffles the submissions, and then reads each ending aloud for the group.  Players must then vote for the ending they think is authentic. A player gets 2 points for each vote that their submission receives, and an additional 2 points if they vote for the correct ending. If no player votes for the real ending then the Reader is awarded 3 points.&#10;&#10;Once a player has earned 20 points, the game is over. If there is no winner at the end of a round, then the next player becomes the Reader and this process repeats.&#10;&#10;&quot;All the Wit of the World... is Not in One Head&quot;&#10;&#10;With 2500 sayings from across the world, creative wordplay and careful use of dialect are just as important in this game as the metaphors that you create.&#10;&#10;&quot;The Beginning is...

2654;Snap;"The Snap deck consists of 60 cards in 4 color suits. The cards are numbered front and back from 1 to 15. The game is played in two phases. In the &quot;cool phase,&quot; players draw and discard cards in turn order, with the stipulation that the discarded card must be higher in value than the one drawn. This continues until one player is satisfied with the mix achieved in his/her 7-card hand and calls &quot;Snap.&quot; At that point, the &quot;hot phase&quot; begins, with players slapping cards at will - although one at a time - on the discard pile. When two cards with with matching color are placed one over the other, that suit becomes the winning suit. Players then score points for cards of that color in their hand. Players also score for all other cards of any color with numbers matching their winning-suit cards remaining in other players' hands (except for cards valued 10 and above). It is suggested to play as many rounds as players in the game, with the player achieving the most points overall winning.&#10;&#10;";1997;3.44444;0.0

In this game, you are the leader of a project team in a bookbinding shop. Together with your team (your cards) you try to handle the mountain of incoming job. There are small orders, which are relatively easy to fill but yield only small profit, and big orders, for which a great deal of work must be done. Big jobs also bring big profits, however. The prize that our team receives for a successfully completed job is dependent on the number of tasks. However, the number of machines is limited and the competition among the teams is rough. No methods are shunned in the constant effort to keep away opposing workers or hinder their performance, not even bribery or sabotage. The only thing that matters at the end of the game is which team has the most money.&quot;&#10;-From English rulebook&#10;&#10;";2001;5.75;2.0

If you get 4 or less on two dice, you move twice the amount, if you get it on three, you move thrice.  If you total more than 4, you're busted and your piece goes off board, plus a chip is added to the pot (initially seeded with 1 chip).  As pieces move, they push those in front of them on the track.  There are two exit tracks where you get to push pieces over the side.  Whenever this happens, you also add a chip to the pot.  You can get back on track only if there is a carrier piece available.&#10;&#10;As you pass the pot, you grab the chips there (and seed it again with a chip).

2666;A Mighty Fortress;"Subtitle of the game: &quot;Reformation and Counter-Reformation, 1532-1555&quot;&#10;&#10;On the box cover: &quot;The time is 6 February 1531.&quot;&#10;&#10;One of the games in SPI's Power Politics series.&#10;&#10;From the publisher:&#10;&#10;Recreating the turbulent era of the Reformation, from the viewpoint of political/religious interaction and military activity. A Mighty Fortress is designed with a mechanical simplicity that is matched only by the subtlety of the game's interplay among contesting forces.&#10;&#10;A Mighty Fortress simulates the conditions, which made possible the spread of the Lutheran Reformation and the subsequent Catholic reaction (the Counter-Reformation) in the years 1532-1555. The game recreates the actual historical objectives of the major countries in Europe in the Sixteenth Century as well as their military strengths and resources. There are six players in the game representing the six major countries, England, France, the Ottoman Empire, the Hapsburgs, the Pope, and the collection of German states we will call The Lutherans.&#10;&#10;The Lutheran player is intent on promoting the Protestant cause throughout Europe, and the Papacy is equally resolved to gather any straying nations back into the Catholic fold. The Hapsburg Empire -- strong in arms and sprawling across half the continent -- seeks to maintain its possessions in the face of pressure from all directions. In England, Henry VIII is engaged with his own confrontation with the Pope; and French forces are marshalling to dismantle the Hapsburg dominions. And Suleiman the Magnificent is constantly watching for the opportunity to expand his Ottoman empire -- at anyone's expense.&#10;&#10;The Hapsburgs have, by far, the largest number of combat forces. Unhindered by other problems, they could easily suppress Lutheranism. However, other players have objectives that can usually be achieved only at the expense of the mighty Hapsburgs. Therefore, depending on the rapidly shifting political situation, there will probably be several alliances against Hapsburg influence. Because of this convoluted political situation, the players will often find themselves at cross-purposes with other players whom they were aiding the Game-Turn before. Thus, the possibilities for political and military interaction are extensive.&#10;&#10;A Mighty Fortress covers the twenty-four years from 1532 to 1555 -- a period fraught with shifting alliances, political and religious fervor, and frantic efforts to shift the balance of power. Theological debates, treaties of peace, declarations of war, excommunication, taxation, and missionaries -- all are included in this simulation of one of the most violent and implacably hostile eras of European history. The game covers all actions from the year 1532 -- right after formation of the Schmalkaldic League -- until 1555 and the Peace of Augsburg, which guaranteed Lutheranism as a religion [sic] and allowed the German estates to choose between that and Catholicism.&#10;&#10;Other notes:&#10;&#10;Special rules include those for missionaries, conversion, peace treaties, formal alliances, truces, ultimata, ceding territory, income and borrowing, theological debates, excommunication, Henry VIII's divorce and hidden, variable victory conditions.&#10;Counters = 200&#10;&#10;Other credits:&#10;&#10;Graphic Design: Redmond A.

They build the Rube Goldberg inspired mousetrap as they move their mice across the board. They also try to collect cheese cards, which allow them to move other mice to cheese wheel which is the bait for the trap.  Once the mousetrap has been completely constructed, players can attempt to capture each others' mice in it by turning the crank, which activates the mousetrap. If the mousetrap doesn't malfunction, the mouse is captured and out of the game. The winner is the last mouse who avoids being trapped.  The main appeal of Mouse Trap is the ridiculously complex contraption that is the mousetrap.

The board simulates an old map and is divided into four trading regions, each with multiple ports.  Each region sells a different spice and the market price is controlled by card play.  However, an &quot;expert price&quot; can be obtained by guessing the identity of a mystery spice.  The game actually comes with around twenty small containers of real spices that get thrown into a bag.  If a player is trying to get an expert price, he picks one container  at random, opens it, sniffs it, and guesses what it is from a list of common and not so common spices.&#10;&#10;This is not the main aspect of gameplay, but it does spice it up, so to speak.  It is mostly a commodity speculation game; not only do the players need to get good prices on the spices that they are bringing back to Europe, they also need to lay in supplies in order to keep their ship on the move.  Obtaining the money to buy  supplies requires selling spices to regions other than the spice's region of origin; and in this case, a player wants the spice price to be high.&#10;&#10;Event cards add a random aspect to the game and there are pirates prowling the waters who are out to ruin a captain's best laid plans.&#10;&#10;Title translates to &quot;The Spice Route&quot;.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.67705;1.25

The animals are sad because all of the colors have been pinched.  Collecting cards is their way of finding them again.&#10;&#10;";2001;5.48333;1.0
2713;James Clavell's Noble House;"From the Publisher:&#10;&#10;Noble House is a game based on the novel by James Clavell. In this game, players take the part of the Tai-Pans of major corporations doing business in Hong Kong in the early 1960's, as portrayed in the Clavell book. Each player is head of a large business conglomerate and is striving to be the most influential and powerful leader in the Hong Kong business community. The route to power lies in the manipulations of the stock market, banks, and holding companies, and other typical corporate skull duggery.&#10;&#10;Synopsis of play:&#10;&#10;During a turn, players draw event cards, which can be used in many ways to affect one's own future, or the future of an opponent. Players then buy and sell stocks on a volatile stock market, which can fluctuate due to purchase and sale of stocks, failed contracts, or even loss of face (bad faith deals). Contracts are then announced, and if a player has sufficient assets, and can maintain those assets, lots of money can be made. Unfulfilled contracts go up for a general bid amongst the players. Players can then attempt to acquire loans from 3 Hong Kong banks, but, if the Bank Directors, or their proxies, so vote, a player can simply be denied a loan. Furthermore, bank directors, in the person of voting cards held by players, can call in outstanding loans, which must be immediately paid. Players now purchase various assets, such as airlines, railroads, shipping lines, industry, land, and human services, which the player must have to fulfill contractual obligations. Players can buy their own assets, or even lease them from other players. All possible wheeling and dealing is allowed, and no one is ever required to keep his or her end of a bargain. Lastly, if a player's stock falls far enough, and they have been unfortunate enough to lose enough of their own &quot;voting&quot; stock, they can be voted out of the game, which will end the game at the end of that phase. Otherwise, the game ends on the turn when the last event card is drawn.&#10;&#10;";1981;6.40217;2.7143

Each player starts with 4 pieces each in a different column at the lowest 4 levels of the board.&#10;&#10;On your turn, one of your pieces can jump up the number of levels (while remaining in the same column) equal to the number of pieces on the level it jumps from. However:&#10;- Only one piece may occupy each space.&#10;- The highest piece of any color may not make a single level jump.&#10;- In the non-scoring levels, two pieces of the same color cannot be at the same level.&#10;&#10;The game ends when no player can legally move or if there 2 pieces left in the non scoring levels.

2753;Demon's Run;"&quot;A game of the Starcup Challenge Racing Series&quot;&#10;&#10;Demon's Run is a simulation of the most demanding and deadly race in the Starcup Challenge Racing Series.  A course constructed in a savage area of turbulent space studded with rotating black holes, fluctuating intense radiation zones, space-time disruption fields and randomly moving hunter-killer mines that will test your piloting skill and courage to the fullest.  Set within this field are a series of Buoys that must be recovered to score victory points.  Some of the Buoys are in fixed positions, others move randomly.  The most valuable of all are the Astaroth, Belial and Lucifer Buoys which are locked in tight orbit in the intense radiation zones surrounding the monstrous Hell2 and Hell3 black holes.  Players must design their ships' maximum function levels in each category of ship operation and must pilot the ship through the treacherous course in the quest of Buoys.  Players must always be aware of the course obstacles, the positions of the other racers, and the remaining fuel supply of their ship.  Demon's Run is a game that is played in a delicate balance between success and disaster.  It is not some simple couple hundred laps around an oval track.  Demon's Run is a wide eyed, full power leap into the mouth of Hell!&#10;&#10;You design your ship before each race by distributing points between Fuel, Structural Integrity, Pilot Integration, Main Engines, Manoeuvre Engines, Tractor (used to recover buoys), Laser (used to attack buoys, mines and other players' ships), Scrambler (used to disorient an opposing player), Screens and Velocity.  Campaign rules are provided so pilots and ships can improve between races.  It is relatively easy to make the game playable by more than four --you need only make up more ship set up sheets and a few counters.&#10;&#10;";1981;5.85393;2.5556

2763;TouchÃ©;"Each player has 6 pieces lined up on his side of a 5&times;5 grid, either the rectangular or the rounded pieces. Pieces are transparent, and inside them are magnetized metal disks, one side red, the other white. In this distant variation on Tic-Tac-Toe, your ultimate goal is to arrange that 4 disks of your color are in a row, regardless of the shapes of the pieces. Under the board are magnetic strips of unknown polarity. As you place a piece into a new space, it might stay as it is, but it could also happen that the disk flipped and the piece joined your opponent's side. Options during a turn are either to enter a piece, move a piece, or jump a piece.&#10;&#10;Later published as Magic 4 by Discovery Toys and in Germany under the original title by Parker, where it was nominated for Spiel des Jahres of 1979.&#10;&#10;";1977;5.73049;1.6429
2765;Too Many Cooks;"Players represent cooks attempting to gather the necessary ingredients to cook a variety of meals. There are a variety of ethnic dishes represented (English, Chinese, Italian, French or Indian), a few of which are also vegetarian. Players get bonuses for specializing in a certain ethnic cuisine and must be mindful to prepare at least one&#10;vegetarian dish lest they be penalized by the growing veggie-lover contingent.&#10;&#10;A number of recipes are played face-up to the table (onto a well designed board), with each recipe listing the ingredients it requires.&#10; Players begin the game with only one ingredient and must acquire new ingredients either through auction (the most common method) or random draw (costly and a crap-shoot). When a player acquires new ingredients, whether it is on his turn or not, he immediately has the opportunity to&#10;prepare one of the dishes depicted on the face-up recipe cards. If he can supply all of the necessary ingredients, he takes the corresponding recipe card and acquires money (beans ... actual beans!) to increase his coffers. Players may also cook recipes which were previously cooked by other players, but they only receive a portion of the monetary amount the original cook received.&#10;&#10;";2001;5.6;1.3333
2767;Snail's Pace Race;"In this very simple children's game, all six snails are in play regardless of the number of players.  Each player bets which two snails will come in first and last.

2770;Stay Alive;"The game consists of a 7x7 board with horizontal and vertical slides that can be in any of three positions each.  Each slide has a certain number of holes in it.  Initially, the board is set up in any random position, then the players deploy their marbles onto the non-holed spaces.  On your turn, you change a slider's setting, hoping to open new holes underneath opponents' marbles.  The last player to Stay Alive wins.&#10;&#10;";1965;5.09143;1.2027
2771;Maginor;"In Maginor, players are trying to gain votes from various oracles. Maginor visits each one in turn. The player with the most influence counters at an oracle can take either the points for the oracle or the spell card there. The player with the second most influence gets whichever the first player didn't take. Spells have one-time effects that alter different aspects of the game.&#10;&#10;Influence is gained at the oracles both by playing cards and rolling a die. This gives a mix of random chance and control over the game. If a player tries to get influence in a position occupied by another player's influence counter, they must duel. This is a RPS mechanic with a twist. If both players choose an &quot;earthbeast&quot; in the duel, the defender wins.&#10;&#10;When all oracles are scored, the player with the most total votes wins.&#10;&#10;This is a reworking of Reiner Knizia's Vegas. Maginor adds some cards, spells, and a different &quot;dueling&quot; mechanic.&#10;&#10;";2001;5.48277;1.8444
2772;Mutant Chess;"Mutant Chess is a chess variant where the pieces mutate throughout the game. Higher ranked pieces (like queens) can split up and become lower ranked pieces. Lower ranked pieces (like pawns) can combine to become more powerful. The only piece that can't change its status is the King. Mutant Chess is played on a slightly smaller board and there have been some modification to the pieces, but the basic chess game is still the heart of this game.&#10;&#10;";2001;7.0;3.0

2780;Tarock;"Tarock is a general term for the many 2 to 5 player, point trick taking games of central Europe that use a 54-card Tarock deck.  Common to these games is a round of bidding followed by a round of announcements indicating bonuses that will be attempted during the round of play, and doublings of the game, or any of the announced bonuses. The deck consists of 4 suits (usually clubs, spades, hearts, diamonds), and a permanent trump suit (Tarock) of 22 cards.&#10;&#10;There are variants of tarock for 2 to 5 players.&#10;&#10;Straw man tarock is a variant for 2 players where each players hand is augmented by cards dealt out into piles in front of him/her at the beginning of the game.&#10;&#10;Tapp tarock is a variant for 3 players that does away with the bid to 'call a king'.&#10;&#10;K&ouml;nigrufen is a variant for 4 active players (with 5 one player deals and sits out that round) who are dealt 12 cards and 6 for the talon, bidding indicates how many cards will be used from the talon with the remaining cards being split by the other players. The declarer calls a trump (XIX) or one of the kings to indicate a partner (the partner does not indicate this fact though), after which players can make bonus announcements and doublings. During the play, suit must be followed and trump must be played if you are out of the suit. Points are counted after each round and the declarer, generally, needs to take more than half in order to fulfill the contract.&#10;&#10;";1425;7.35416;3.6316
2781;My Word!;"A dealer turns over cards, each card having a single letter or a two-letter combination; as soon as any player spots a word that can be formed using any set of three or more cards, they shout it out and claim the cards (if the word was valid). Once the deck is exhausted, each player gets one point per card claimed. Play as many rounds as there are players.&#10;&#10;Re-Implements: Diabolo.&#10;&#10;";2001;5.66509;1.3182
2782;Vantage;"There are 106 cards: 5 suits (red, yellow, green, blue, purple) of 1-14, four Wild cards and 28 Action cards (Cards Up, Black Out, Pass One, Lose One). Each suit contains one special &quot;BIG&quot; card used in scoring (Red 10, Yellow 6, Green 7, Blue 12, Purple 2). Initial deal is four, Action cards in a separate stack.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you turn over an Action card and follow its instructions. You then match, build or discard one card from your hand. Cards Up turns all cards on the table face up, Black Out face down. Pass One means everyone passes a card to one's right. Lose One means you put a card down face up.&#10;&#10;Matching concerns the card values; you can collect cards of the same value as the played card, or pairs of cards that add up to that value. Building means you match as above but leave the matched cards as a pile, vulnerable to another player's matching. This is usually done so you can collect another card from your own hand (so you would &quot;Build eights&quot; with the table's 5+3 and your 8, hoping to &quot;Match eights&quot; on your next turn with your other 8). Discarding is what you do if you cannot Match or Build. This increases the table's pool of cards open for matching or building.&#10;&#10;After you've played your 4 cards in this way, another round ensues, and so forth until the entire deck has been gone through. Scoring is +10 for the most cards collected, +8 for the most Purple cards collected, +6 for the most Red cards collected, +4 for each &quot;BIG&quot; card collected, +2 for each 1 card, +2 for each Wild card.&#10;&#10;During a Black Out, you must memorize which card is which; if you declare a play but get the cards wrong, your played card is simply added to those already face down on the table.&#10;&#10;";1985;4.45238;1.3333
2783;Thieves in the Wood;"Each player is a farmer trying to bring his year's income (1000 thalers) to the bank.  Unfortunately, the path traverses a wood infested with thieves.

Those farmers that make it early to the bank get to collect interest whilst waiting for the others.

Is a germ-free board game, we hope, for those of you who dare to transport wagon loads of infected victims to their final resting place, a deep pit at Clarks Hill. &#10; Object: Inspired by the yodel 'Bring out your Dead' the object of the game, for those who wish to play, is for each player to control a wagon which is used to visit the houses. Plague victims are 'claimed' and taken away to a burial site. All this whilst avoiding rats and fleas. The first to 'bury' 99 victims wins (remember, you're only doing your job). The winner must now go off and infect the rest of England.&#10;&#10;";1991;5.5341;1.2222
2785;Game of Goose;"The Game of Goose is an ancient children's classic, possibly tracing its roots all the way to the Ancient Egyptian game of Mehen which was played in early Old Kingdom times.&#10;&#10;Francesco de Medici in Italy sent a copy of this game to King Felipe II of Spain during the 16th century.&#10;It became one of the most popular games in Europe during that time.&#10;&#10;Circa 1600, Beno&icirc;t Rigaud's heirs printed in Lyon &quot;Le Jeu de l'oye, renouvell&eacute; des Grecs, jeu de grand plaisir, comme aujourd'huy princes &amp; grands seigneur&quot; [sic] &quot;le pratiquent&quot; - Le jeu de l'oie, renewed from the Greeks, game of great pleasure, as today princes and great lord [sic] play it -, the oldest French copy known.&#10;&#10;Father Claude-Fran&ccedil;ois Menestrier describes the game in his &quot;Biblioth&egrave;que curieuse et instructive&quot; (1704) : 'There's another type of game, that seems easier to learn, and easier to play; it's the game of goose so common and it is said to come from the Greeks, though nothing can be found about it in their authors. This game is much easier than cards game, because it's always wholly displayed to the players, and, being in the form of a snail or spirally folded snake, it's appropriate to print the things that one wants to learn...'.&#10;&#10;The game became an instant hit in France in the 1600s, and engendered a lot of variants (educational, commemorative, ...) up to the present day.&#10;&#10;It turned up later in England about 1750, according to Whitehouse, under the title &quot;Royall &amp; most pleasant game of the goose - Invented at the Consistory in Rome and are printed and sold by H. OVERTON at Ye White Horse without Newgate where all sorts of Fine Prints and maps are Sold and Framed at Reasonable Rate&quot;.&#10;&#10;By 1851 it had been copied by the American publisher J.P. Beach of New York who entitled it The Jolly Game of Goose. An 1855 edition was called simply The Game of Goose.&#10;&#10;It is a simple game of racing, using a spiral track with lovely illustrations. The main principle is one shared with Snakes and Ladders as well as the later Game of Life: virtue is rewarded and vice is punished.&#10;&#10;Schmidt Spiele rates their G&auml;nsespiel for ages 5 and up.&#10;&#10;Bibliography&#10;Whitehouse, F.

Birmingham: Priory Press Ltd.&#10;'Jeux de princes, jeux de vilains', edited by Eve Netchine, Biblioth&egrave;que nationale de France / Seuil (2009).&#10;&#10;--gameplay description from Wikipedia:&#10;The board consists of a track with consecutively numbered spaces (usually 63), and is often arranged in a spiral with the starting point at the outside. Each player's piece is moved according to throws of one or two dice. Scattered throughout the board are a number of spaces on which a goose is depicted; landing on a goose allows the player to move again by the same distance. Additional shortcuts, such as spaces marked with a bridge, move the player to some other specified position. There are also a few penalty spaces which force the player to move backwards or lose one or more turns, the most recognizable being the one marked with a skull and symbolizing death; landing on this space results in the player being sent back to start. On Spanish boards the reverse is usually a Pachisi board.&#10;&#10;Many themed versions of the game have been created, depicting topics as diverse as ice skating, Richard Nixon, and sewage pumps. These can be valued for their historical or artistic merits even by those who have no interest in the game itself, with some editions having been sold for thousands of dollars at auction or displayed in museums.&#10;&#10;";1587;3.49871;1.0556
2788;First to Reverse;"In this simple racing game, a racing car, a motorcycle, a bicycle and a roller skater are competing.  Each rolls varying number of dice, some of which are d3 instead of d6.  The race is even because each racer has a different turnaround point (the race is won by the first to get back to the starting point after reaching his turnaround point).  On average, all racers should finish neck-and-neck.&#10;&#10;";1988;4.75913;1.0

The game starts with the coconuts mixed on the board so that no one knows which one contains which colour.  Then each player peeks at one coconut.  On your turn, you roll a die.  Results possible include turning the board 90 degrees, guessing at a coconut's bobbles' colour (that's how you get bobbles) and having each player swap two coconuts as quickly as possible.&#10;&#10;A very merry game!&#10;&#10;Awards&#10;&#10;1992 &#195;&#133;rets Familiespil, Family Game of the Year Denmark&#10;&#10;";1992;5.4536;1.1304

2794;Spinball;"Try to maneuver the ping-pong ball into your opponents goal by deftly applying just enough backspin and English to reflect off the sidewalls and around the barrier that separates you.  You have 5 attempts to get a goal, as long as the ball keeps returning to you.  But if you put too much speed on it, it'll fly off the other side as there's no backstop in this game, only side rails.  If you can manage to curl it all the way into your opponents 'end zone' and make it come back into the goal, you get two points.  But instead of taking a point, you can set up a blocker instead, to try to protect your goal.  Comes with each players yoke like ball holder and rubber shooting implement with a small wooden handle.

2796;Quickely Dice;"Quik E Ly Dice is part dice game, part card collecting and melding game.&#10;A single set consists of 8 dice in 2 colours and 54 cards, 27 of in each of the same two colours as the dice.&#10;One set is suitable for two players, and there are three sets in all; Using all three with half the 162 cards allows up to six players.&#10;The cards depict two dice faces, one above the other. The object is to score points by collecting and then melding the cards, a la rummy.&#10;Players may meld numerical sequences of up to 11 cards, scoring 1 point for each card in the meld. These sequences must be along the top row dice face of the cards. Bonus points are scored for also forming certain combinations along the bottom row. For example, a sequence showing Red 1/4, 2/5, 3/6, 4/6 would score 16 points; 4 points for the 1,2,3,4 sequence along the top row, multiplied by 2 for all the cards being the same color, multiplied by 2 again for the 4,5,6 sequence along the bottom. There are several other bonuses which may be scored. &#10;The mechanics of the game are very simple. Several cards will be face up on the table at any one time. Each player may roll up to 3 of their 4 dice in an attempt to capture 1 or more of these cards.&#10;Cards are captured by rolling the two numbers corresponding to the two dice on a card. Thus, rolling a 1, 4, 5 will allow you to capture a 5/1, a 4/1 or a 5/4 card, provided they are available.&#10;If a player rolls just one of the numbers on a card that he/she wants, that player may &quot;reserve&quot; that card by placing the single dice on the card. If the player subsequently rolls the second number in a later turn, he/she can take the card. Reserved cards may still be captured by other players.&#10;";2001;4.0;2.0

2799;Arabian Nightmare: The Kuwait War;"Arabian Nightmare: The Kuwait War, was designed and published while the late 1990 events in Kuwait were still unfolding, so in effect it was a near-future game which became an historical game within a few months.&#10;&#10;The game has one map and 300 counters. The map covers the Persian Gulf, Saudi Arabia, the eastern part of Iraq and its border with Iran. Turn/Time Scale is 1-3 days per Military Action Segment and 4-6 days per Political Action Segment (a full turn is 2 MAS and 1 PAS, so 6-12 days total).&#10;&#10;The game may be played using only the Military rules, the Political rules or both sets.

2800;The Ironclads: A Tactical Level Game of Naval Combat in the American Civil War 1861-1865;"(from a Yaquinto ad:)&#10;&#10;The IRONCLADS is a tactical level, simultaneous movement, game of ship-to-ship combat in the American Civil War. Players move one or more of over 130 counters that represent individual ships over a large (42&quot; x 27-1/2&quot;) four pieceqeomorphlc mapboard as they attempt to outmaneuver and out-shoot their opponents. 45 ship specification cards give such vital information as the number, size, location and play of individual guns that are fired separately using specific range and penetration tables for each weapon. The ship specification card also contains target information for such areas as; armor, siding, decking, smoke stack, hull, pilot house, waterline, crew and gun hits. Other unit counters include five individual forts, floating batteries, mines, torpedos, booms, piles, heavy obstructions, fires, damaged ships, sunk ships, mortar rafts and much more.&#10;&#10;'The IRONCLADS comes boxed and complete with over 300 extra&shy; thick, die cut unit counters, the large mapboard, a well organized log pad, a set of charts and tables, range and play indicators for firing, two game dice, a plastic tray for unit separation and storage, 45 ship specification cards that represent 90 classes of ships and a rule book that covers such items as river currents, tides, forts, mines, armor penetra tion, crew quality and morale, smoke and sighting, sand bars, shoals and river banks, burning ships and fire fighting, different types of shot, cumulative damage in specific areas, critical hits and much, much more. Scenarios included in the game range from excellent &quot;running the forts&quot; situations for solitaire play, to famous ship-to-ship engage ments like the Monitor and the Merrimac, to blockade running, to multi-player campaign games like Mobile Bay.&#10;&#10;";1979;7.35939;3.5278
2801;Goldraub in London;"Components of &quot;Gold Robbery in London&quot; include 1 game board, 37 sector cards, 12 tip cards, 1 search block, 6 wooden pawns and 1 marker.  The game seems based on the work of Edgar Wallace (1875&ndash;1932), author of more than 150 detective and adventure novels. The numbers on the hexagonal board correspond to those on the sector cards. Tip cards either say &quot;false tip&quot; or &quot;gold bar&quot;. Each player receives a copy of the police gazette, one of each of the two types of tip cards and three sector cards.&#10;Each player tries to find out what cards the other players have. Landing on a space, the player asks and if players have the corresponding cards, they show the positive tip card, otherwise they show the negative card.  Each player also gets to find out what the player to their right showed. When someone feels they have located the exact place where gold has been hidden, he can interrupt the game and see if he is right.  If correct, he gets a huge bonus, but if wrong takes a major hit to his score.&#10;&#10;2 years later described in Reinhold Wittig's SPIELECOLLECTION No. 1 Spiele zur Schatzinsel (1988) as &quot;Versteckt und Entdeckt&quot;.&#10;&#10;";1986;5.94091;2.6667
2802;War in Europe;"War in Europe is a compendium of three modules, War in the East 2nd ed., War in the West, and War in Europe. The two base games, War in the East 2nd ed. and War in the West, are both playable individually and are both designed for two sided play. War in Europe provides an integrated linkage between these two and provides for three player play.&#10;&#10;The game system traces its lineage from SPI's earlier Kursk and Destruction of Army Group Centre but was primarily inspired by War in the  East 1st. ed.  War in Europe is played on nine full sized (22&quot;x34&quot;) coloured  maps and employs about 3600 1/2x1/2&quot; cardboard pieces.&#10;&#10;The three sides in the full game are the Italo-German Axis, the Anglo- French-American Allies, and the Soviet Union. Political rules govern the  alignment of neutral states and restrict the use of active minor power units  by the controlling players. Rules also restrict the degree of co-operation between units of differing nationalities, whether Axis or Allied. The victory  conditions are also constructed to limit the degree of co-operation between  independent Allied and Soviet players.&#10;&#10;Each 3/4&quot; hex represents 20 miles. A single game-turn consists of three sequential player turns and represents one week elapsed time. Four game- turns form a 'cycle' at the beginning of which strategic warfare and economic production takes place. Thirteen cycles form a game year. Both Axis and Soviet power produce additional forces via a simplified economic  production process. Allied forces are received only by a preset reinforcement schedule.&#10;&#10;Player pieces called units represent division and brigade sized military formations. In addition to units, all powers also possess air-point counters representing abstract air power at an estimated scale of 500 sorties per point. Markers are a third category of playing piece used to note some temporary alteration to the map or to a unit.&#10;&#10;Allied and Axis powers have amphibious point counters representing invasion lift assets. Each amphibious point is capable of lifting a single divisional sized unit and as acting as a 'beachhead' supply source. The Axis powers also have counters for Naval Transport points and Naval Surface Combat points. The Axis may build these points via his production routines.&#10;&#10;Naval points (of all types) risk interception and elimination (along with any transported unit) by air power when used to transport land units, enable  supply, or provide escort. Axis naval points also risk Allied naval interception and elimination when conducting transport operations on the high seas (anywhere other than the Baltic). The Allied player has a  standard number of naval transport points (15) that does not change from turn to turn and which cannot be destroyed when intercepted, though their cargo may be. Expended (not destroyed) amphibious points are automatically returned to play after a nine turn delay.&#10;&#10;The Soviet power possesses one transport point in the Baltic so long as Leningrad remains uncaptured and one naval transport point in the Black Sea so long as the Soviet retains at least one Black Sea port. If the Soviets ever lose their naval transport capability in either sea then it is lost for the rest of the game and cannot be restored.&#10;&#10;The Axis power possesses counters for sub points and markers for land fortifications (the Atlantic Wall). Both of these must be produced using the economic system employed during the strategic inter-phase conducted at the start of each cycle. Sub points are used to determine the rate of Allied reinforcement and are themselves subject to loss.&#10;&#10;The Allied power receives Strategic Bomber Points which are used to disable Axis Production and Transportation during the Strategic Inter- phase. These are subject to loss by German Strategic Air Defence air- points and Flak Points.&#10;&#10;A number of scenarios are provided covering the entire war or significant campaigns. Victory is determined by the Axis political point total and the possession of specified hexes. The Axis political point total is adjusted during the game based on Allied and Axis actions together with the control of specific hexes or the conquest/occupation/liberation of nations. A novel feature in the design is the use of varying CRTs by nation/year to account for the changing relationships in the combat power of units over the course of a six year war without recourse to replacement counters for the units.&#10;&#10;The original game was issued in SPI notorious 'flat-pack' plastic tray packaging that required three units to contain the product. Later (1978?) War in Europe was retailed in the large bookcase box format (the Soap- box). The game was ported to a MS-DOS computer program published by  Decision Games in 1996 and a revised reprint of the original boardgame was published by Decision Games in 1999. A New PC version of war in Europe will allow players to battle one another PBEM or face to face and is currently under development.&#10;&#10;The game contains: &#10;- 3600 counters&#10;&#10;        (Three identical Axis 400 counter contersheets)&#10;        (Three identical Russian 400 counter contersheets)&#10;        (Three identical Western Allied 400 counter contersheets)&#10;&#10;&#10;- Nine maps (A-H,J)&#10;- Four Rulebooks&#10;&#10;        (Standard Rules)&#10;        (War in the East 2nd Edition Exclusive Rules)&#10;        (War in the West Exclusive Rules)&#10;        (War in Europe Exclusive Rules)&#10;&#10;&#10;- Axis Production Spiral&#10;- Soviet Production Spiral&#10;- Axis Game-Turn Cycle Record Track&#10;- Soviet Game-Turn Cycle Record Track &#10;- Allied Game-Turn Cycle Record Track&#10;- Two Identical War in the East Comvbat Results Tables&#10;- Two Identical War in the West Comvbat Results Tables&#10;&#10;";1976;7.21583;3.9231
2803;Ave;"Ave is a game by Valentin Herman for 2-4 Romans, published as a game-kit in 2000 by Fanfor with the intent of developing it into a full game later. Players compete to gain credit for developing a fine Roman city with schools, aqueducts, markets, forums and so on, whilst also controlling Provinces in the Roman empire.

2804;200 Jahre Montgolfieren;"&quot;200 Years of Hot Air Balloons&quot; commemorates the bicentennial of the 1783 first balloon ascent by the Montgolfier brothers.&#10;&#10;The board is circular and divided into ten concentric rings. Twenty-four &quot;spokes&quot; combine with them to form a grid. Players each have a wooden balloon which shows its altitude by stacking it up, insecurely it seems, on small wooden disks. They also receive at start four ascent cards and four descent (gas bottle) cards. A wooden arrow on a disk at the center shows the current wind direction.&#10;&#10;Players move by rolling two dice, a special one which describes a change in wind direction or a requirement on the player and an ordinary one which gives the amount to move. There are actually three games in one, all centered around getting a balloon to a specific location, the first two based on real life balloonist games: a chase or &quot;fox hunt&quot; and a target race. The third scenario describes a race to the center of the board.&#10;&#10;";1983;5.91667;0.0

2808;The Russian Campaign;"On the 18th of December, 1940 Hitler issued Fuhrer Directive No. 21, code named Barbarossa, which stated: &ldquo;The Soviet Union is to be crushed in one swift campaign before the war with England ends.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;On the 22nd of June, 1941, Barbarossa was finally launched. Over three million German soldiers, most of them veterans of the campaigns in Poland, France, and the Balkans, began a blitzkrieg style of invasion against two million Russian defenders. The initial advance was fantastic. Hundreds of thousands of prisoners were taken and the motorized divisions began to outrun the rest of the army. The Germans reached the gates of Moscow, victory in sight. Then the winter came.&#10;&#10;RUSSIAN CAMPAIGN has been universally acclaimed as one of the finest wargames around. With the ease and playability of the 'Classics', the game also conveys the feel of the actual campaign and is exceptionally accurate historically. Both players will have to use the subtle skills, advantages, and tactics of their historical counterparts to win.&#10;&#10;Game features include rail movement, sea movement, invasions, stukas, partisans, automatic victory, SS units, sudden death victory conditions, and double impulse movement capabilities.

Basically, when you probe a grid location, the opponent announces how many of his agents can be reached in a straight line (including diagonals) from the probed location --excluding any of his agents which may be hidden behind others.&#10;&#10;Some extra complications occur because both are playing on the same map: for example, you may not probe where the opponent has probed, which opens up strategic opportunities...  &quot;Checkpoint: Danger!&quot; is what you call out when you're convinced one of his agents is in the same location as one of yours.&#10;&#10;";1978;6.33929;1.3333
2811;Blind Justice;"The Game of Lawsuits uses 168 condensed versions of actual damage claims in the US courts, as players represent the plaintiffs and defendants. As they win or lose cases, by skill or chance, players rise through the court system and win by getting lots of money.

2812;Platoon;"Platoon is a simple wargame on small squad combat in Vietnam.  The game is similar to AH's Smithsonian series games:  a single sheet with basic rules and a small booklet that contains advanced rules, additional scenarios and historical background information.  The combat system is also similar to other Smithsonian games.&#10;&#10;The scenarios and soldiers are based upon events and characters in the movie.&#10;&#10;The game uses two elements to create fog of war:&#10;-  the counters have small stands so the identity of each counter is unknown to the enemy.  Some of the counters are fakes and &quot;substitutes&quot; (these are used to combine several counters into a single group.  All counters are placed in an off board box and the matching substitute counter is placed on the map.)&#10;-  Random initiative draw.  Similar to Firepower, chits for each side are placed in a cup and each turn one is randomly drawn to determine which player may move.&#10;&#10;Platoon had a AH complexity rating of 3.&#10;&#10;";1986;5.91601;2.1081
2813;Scrabble Duplicate Crossword Game;"This is a a version of Scrabble that all of the people at a party can play.&#10;&#10;Each players has a sheet that matches the Scrabble board. The dealer deals out 7 cards with letters and each player plays a word using those letters on his personal board, as if playing Scrabble. Each turn 7 new letters are dealt out. The game continues until the deck (which matches the letter distribution of regular Scrabble) runs out.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses players will make different decisions than they would in the regular game. There are no defensive considerations to consider, but how to set yourself up for the highest score is tricky.&#10;&#10;";1975;6.39615;0.0
2814;Rapid Recall;"A player on one team gives clues to the rest of their team (possibly only 1 player) from a card that contains 10 words or phrases.  If the player knows what the clue is, they throw a chip in a bin on the game board.  Once the time is up, the 10 words have been clued, or the player elects to stop, they begin recalling the words that were clued from memory.  Upon getting the word correct (with one guess at each one only), a chip is taken out of the bin and put down on the guesser's side of the board.  If the clue is missed or if it is forgotten, the chip stays in the bin.  Once the guessing is completed or the time runs out, the other team gets a chance to steal the chips that remain in the bin.  If the remaining chips are not stolen, they go back to the guessing team.  The object is to fill up your side of the board with correctly guessed or stolen chips.&#10;&#10;";1993;6.17713;1.4

2816;Crossfire;"This game is played on a large board like a soccer field, approx 100x80cm. The players each have a rotating plastic gun attached to their end of the board, behind a wire goal frame. The idea is to fire ball bearings from the gun to knock your puck into your opponents goal, and keep theirs  away from yours. The board is slightly curved to cause the balls to roll into pots at each end for re-use.&#10;&#10;A new version has been released by MB. The new version has more than one puck, and a smaller, rounded board. The original version came out in the 1970's and had a rectangular board and simple round pucks.&#10;&#10;This game is similar to Gunfight at OK Corral.&#10;&#10;";1971;5.38923;1.1136

2818;UNO Attack!;"UNO, America's No. 1-selling card game, has a whole new twist. You'll still encounter all the elements that make UNO so unpredictable and challenging, but add to that a motorized card launcher that shows no mercy and you've got UNO Attack. The object of the game is still to get rid of all your cards. The UNO command cards direct the game by telling players when to trade hands, discard, reverse the playing order, or skip a player. Beware the dreaded Hit command, though, as this translates into a game of Russian roulette. You never know when the card launcher is going to fire off a stream of UNO cards just for you!

Cards come in 4 types:  signs,&#10;elements, planets and aspects, and are played to a row of 6 under strict rules.  When every &#10;player has refused to play a card, the last player to have played scores. He adds up the&#10;number of matches he has in columns 1-3 and multiplies by the planet number in column 4&#10; to receive points on paper.

2821;UNO Stacko;"Jenga meets Uno. The blocks are colored and numbered, so you have to pull a block that matches either the color or the number of the previously-pulled block.&#10;&#10;Earlier editions of this game (1994-1996) had a die, the Uno cube, which was used to determine which kind of block had to be moved. In the versions with dice, the die determined either the number or the color of the block to be removed. The Reverse and Draw Two actions were only reflected on the die.&#10;&#10;In the later non-dice versions (1999-present), the actions were instead represented with symbols on some of the blocks (Reverse, Draw Two, Skip Turn, and Wild).&#10;&#10;";1994;5.56387;1.1304
2822;UrÃ¤us;"This two to four-player race game uses a Mehen board (a spiral of 64 squares).  The designer kept the random aspect (which he's done otherwise only with his Pharao game), but used a standard die instead of the Ancient Egyptian throwing sticks.  Each player has three pieces which he tries to bring all the way in to the serpent's head.  I don't think you can take opposing pieces (sending them back to the serpent's tail), but it seems you can form blockages and maybe even you can move back and forth as desired.&#10;&#10;Check out the beautiful board at Pharao-Brettspiele's home page.&#10;&#10;";1993;5.16667;1.0

2824;Sixteen Thirty Something;"&ldquo;Sixteen Thirty Something&hellip;&rdquo; is a game based on the changing political and military situation during the early Seventeenth Century, the time of the Thirty Years War. It deals in an abstract manner with the formation of factions, campaigns, warfare and internal power struggles.&#10;&#10;As a player you take on the role of leading one of the new financial dynasties that arose during that time, with a portfolio of investments across the continent and some influence with the Crowned Heads of Europe. You and the other players use your influence in different nations to sway the Crown into taking action that you hope will improve your fortunes or perhaps hold back your competitors.&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;112 Cards&#10;154 counters&#10;Game Board&#10;Rules&#10;You will need some 6 sided dice, preferably 4 although you can get away with just 1.&#10;&#10;The Files section contains a revised and downloadable version 2 of the game, with pdf files that will allow you to print out and assemble the complete game for yourself.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.20345;2.5294
2826;Jackpot Yahtzee;"To get the highest accumulative score at the end of 3 rounds of play by strategically dropping your tiles in your rack so that they stack up into rows that score horizontally or diagonally but not vertically. On your turn you roll the 4 dice which all have symbols on them. The symbols are cherries, oranges, bells, and dollar signs. If you roll two or more of a symbol you get that tile to place in your rack. If you roll one of each you get your choice. Dollar signs are worth the most then bells, oranges, and then cherries. The more points a symbol is worth the lesser chance it will come up on the dice. More fun and strategy than regular Yahtzee.&#10;&#10;";1980;6.06663;1.1429
2827;Seneti;"This two-player strategy game uses the so-called Ancient Baylonian The Royal Game of Ur game as its board (8x3 with 4 squares taken out to form a waist).  The name, a reference to Senet, is misleading if not downright erroneous (the Ur board was used in the Ancient Egyptian game of Tjau, not Senet).  Once again, the object of the game is to prevent the opponent from having any moves by blocking and taking pieces.  The designer takes full advantage of the square decorations, but I can't tell what the rules are beyond that.&#10;&#10;Check out the beautiful board at Pharao-Brettspiele's home page.&#10;&#10;";1994;5.96154;2.0
2829;Theben;"This two-player strategy game uses an 11x4 board from a game played circa 1150 BC (which is unfamiliar to me, shame). The two central spaces are special, and each player owns his home row, leaving two central rows over which the struggle plays out.  Each player attempts to prevent the other from having any remaining moves, by occupying spaces and taking his ten pieces away.  Stacking is involved --I think you get to move a stack if it is topped by one of your pieces, and if you bring it into your home row you capture the opposing pieces?&#10;&#10;Check out the beautiful board at Pharao-Brettspiele's home page.&#10;&#10;";1996;7.66667;3.0

Queens lay eggs which hatch into workers, soldiers and more queens.&#10;Soldiers fight for the best food-gathering areas. Every so often there is a disaster, i.e. Billy blows up the whole anthill.&#10;&#10;The game is about controlling expansion and choosing the right population mix. A soldier is worth three workers in battle, but useless for gathering food. Queens are defenseless. It is also about choosing the right area. Those rich in food are disaster-prone while the&#10;safe areas are less productive.&#10;&#10;Includes large envelope, 8-page half-size rulebook, 32 cards, 2 11&quot;x17&quot; map sheets and 189 very nice 1&quot; die-cut, silk screened counters on heavy cardboard.&#10;&#10;";1982;7.08333;0.0

The rules are in  Italian, German, English, French and Spanish (would that other publishers tried so hard!), but please note the English rules use the word 'card' for both tiles and cards.&#10;Players move their car by rolling a die and laying tiles to make the winding course (which includes garages to repair damage and refuel etc). But you also draw a card to your hand from which you offer a card to another player. Some are good (go ahead, pass, shortcut), others bad (wrong way, engine trouble, flat tire, breakdown). If they accept, they play the card on themselves; if they refuse, you play it on yourself.&#10;An odd mix of bluff and dice rolling, with little strategy. Works best with more players and children will enjoy it. The graphics are jolly and the game has 6 neat little metal roadsters. Worth a play, but don't chase this one down.&#10;&#10;";1997;5.82654;1.1429
2841;Tennis;"User review: The game is scored exactly as the sport: A player must win a set by a two game margin. The first player (or team) to win six sets claims victory.&#10;&#10;The game consists of two separate decks of cards: the Serve Deck and the Play Deck. Each player is dealt ten cards (or seven, when playing doubles) from the Play Deck. Players must use these cards wisely because they can not replenish their hands until the winner of the set is determined.&#10;&#10;The serving player reveals the top Serve Deck card to get the game started. An Ace card is an automatic point for the server. Revealing consecutive Fault Cards gives an automatic point to the receiving player. Revealing an In Card means the receiving player may respond with a play from one&rsquo;s hand.&#10;&#10;When the game gets going each player may respond with the proper card from one&rsquo;s hand. Failure to or choosing not to respond results in a point for the opponent.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;Play Deck:&#10;&#10;45 normal shots (5 cards for each of 9 possible shots)&#10;2 Out&#10;4 Smash&#10;4 Kill&#10;1 Ad card (not needed to play - same back as other cards but lists other Parker Bros. games to try)&#10;56 cards total&#10;&#10;Serve Deck:&#10;&#10;17 In&#10;3 Ace&#10;7 Fault&#10;&#10;27 cards total&#10;&#10;1 Rules sheet&#10;1 Serve marker&#10;1 Ball marker&#10;Tennis Court Playing Area board&#10;1 advertisement card with Play deck backing&#10;&#10;";1975;4.85308;1.0769

The deck consists of cards numbered 3-7. On a turn, a player lays down 1-3 cards in the center of the table, creating a pile for each number played or adding to an existing pile for that number, so the 3s go on a three pile, the 4s on a four pile, etc. When you play the third 3, the fourth 4, the fifth 5, etc., you take all the cards of that number from the table and place them in a score pile. At the end of your turn, you refill your hand to three cards.&#10;&#10;When one player has no cards remaining in their draw deck and hand, the game ends, and whoever has collected the most cards wins.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.6784;1.0882

The relevant hardware must be purchased, including a rocket powerful enough to lift the weight of the other items involved. The mission is carried out by following a series of steps, and rolling percentiles against the safety rating of specific items each turn - e.g. liftoff roll against rocket, orbital burn roll against space capsule, space walk roll against space suit etc.&#10;If a player fails a safety roll, the advanced game contains several possible failure outcomes (requiring one or more further rolls) ranging from a bulb failure to a catastrophic explosion, which will reset the safety factor of your equipment!&#10;&#10;Once missions are completed, players&rsquo; incomes are adjusted depending on successes / failures, and the next year begins.&#10;&#10;Multiple development options are available, with 1, 2, 3 and 4 man capsules, a shuttle, several rockets, a couple of lunar landers and many other items. Do you follow the US methodical strategy or do you develop a space shuttle in 1961 and glide to the moon?

In June 2007, the creators of Jungle Speed realized that the Joueclub located in the boulevard des Italiens in Paris was commercializing this game, and it was ready to be announced in the Christmas catalog of 2007. The case got opened the 20th of September 2007, and got the final verdict the 19th of March 2010, where Jungle Speed rights won.

2859;Destiny;"Destiny, the Ritual Game of Fortune, concerns the journey through Life as the players try to keep Fortune nearby from Birth to Death. The large board is themed with the signs of the Zodiac and has 5 concentric rings (orbits) and spirals forming the path of life. There is a large (11cm) latex statuette of Lady Luck and players spend tokens, representing years of their life, to an altar to move themselves and the statuette around the board. They can also block spaces with fire tokens. When each player has spent all its tokens, it has died. When the last player dies, whoever Fortune is nearest to, first collects tokens from the altar as a multiple of their age (the orbit they reached) by the number of players. The next player does the same, but multiplied by one less and so on. Presumably the basic game ends with the player with the most tokens winning (the rules don't say!). The advanced game rules allow additional variants, such as bidding or bartering or a quiz based game. One variant goes on to use the won tokens as the start of the After-Life and the designer, Dr Bronia Grycz, encourages players to develop their own rules.

2863;The Great Downhill Ski Game;"The Great Downhill Ski Game is a tile laying game for 1 to 4 skiers, with a large board of white squares, many with green triangles representing pine trees. There are 256 trail tiles showing the parallel lines the skis make in the snow. These go in straight lines, diagonals, turns and sharp turns and a few have 2 trails making crossovers. Players draw ten tiles from the face-down pile and show them. The first player lays as many tiles as possible to make a ski trail down from the top of the hill avoiding the trees, then draws back to ten tiles. A player may choose to use its turn to swap tiles with the pool instead of playing. If your trail is totally blocked, you may remove tiles laid and try again. &#10;When a skier reaches the bottom of the hill, the others may finish their turns. Any finisher gets 25 bonus points, then each player scores their trail, according to the tiles they laid. The straights are worth 1 point, turns 2 pts, sharp turns 3 pts and crossovers are 10 pts. Then deduct the tiles left in hand and the highest total wins.&#10;In the solitaire game, the player draws 50 tiles and tries to make a trail using all 50.&#10;&#10;The rules are in English, French and German and refer to the board as a plastic sheet rolled in a tube, presumably the earlier edition.

The cards are FOOD to be thrown (having a Splat Factor and Dodge Factor), DODGE to dodge food (having a Dodge Factor), EVENT cards (e.g. Catch, Grab, Oops, Butler etc.) to allow actions, and OBJECT cards (e.g. the host's furniture, paintings etc.). You play cards onto each other and draw from the table until the cards run out. If you dodge food, it might hit an object and the host will hassle the thrower (who misses goes). When players can no longer play cards, whoever has the least food on them is &quot;allowed to think they have won&quot;.&#10;The production is fairly simple, the graphics are basic (b &amp; w), and the rules are chatty and a bit unclear. The result is an OK game that tries to be funny. There are no secrets.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Splat!&#10;&#10;&#10;";1992;5.69444;1.5
2867;The Baton Races of Yaz;"Published in issue #82 of Dragon Magazine, Feb 1984. Republished as part of a boxed set: The Best of Dragon Magazine Games in 1990&#10;&#10;The Baton Races of Yaz is played by two teams of Skadingles, Flibdills, Tarnoses and Luggants. The team that breaks all its bulges with its baton in the shortest time is the winner.&#10;&#10;Each side has 2 batons, 5 Skadingles, 5 Flibdills, 5 Tarnoses, 8 Luggants and 10 Bulges&#10;&#10;The game consists of a setting phase, when the bulges are placed on the map, and a movement phase.&#10;&#10;Skadingles are fast but can only move through mud (clear).&#10;Flibdills are slower but can move through mud and muck&#10;Tarnoses are slower again and can travel through all 3 kinds of terrain.&#10;Luggants are the slowest, can move through all 3 kinds of terrain, may not carry the baton, and can throttle opposing Yazzites.&#10;&#10;The interesting mechanic is that the baton may be passed from one Yazzite to another with no movement penalty - allowing long moves.&#10;&#10;";1984;5.47681;1.75
2869;Column;"A weird spin off of Backgammon.  Each player starts with 12 playing pieces on their side of the board. The first player to move all 12 of their playing pieces across the board and off the other side wins. Moves are made by rolling 3 dice. After you roll you decide which die determines which column you can move a piece in and use the other two dice to determine how far by subtracting the smaller number from the larger number. Triples and Double are a big help.&#10;&#10;";2002;5.0;2.0

2873;Siege;"Siege is a two-player tactical level board-wargame, vaguely inspired by ancient Chess-like games such as Chinese Chess.  Four knights (which move like Chess knights) attack a castle guarded by four footmen (like Kings) and a Commander (like Bishops but with a special Rook-like move).  The terrain is divided into the Castle, lawn and moat (for lack of better terminology) and restricts the movement of pieces in various ways.&#10;&#10;Attacker wins by taking the Commander, defender wins by taking all attackers.&#10;&#10;";1966;5.36364;1.5

2901;GolfMania;"It's just like playing golf -- only faster, funnier, and uses cards and dice instead of balls and clubs. Bad pants, while recommended, are not required. &#10;Okay!  it's nothing like playing golf. But it's still a lot of fun!&#10;&#10;Golfmania is a wacky, fast-paced card game for 2 to 6 players. The object of the game is to complete 18 holes of golf through equal parts luck, strategy, and the sincere desire to see your opponents suffer. It's a game the whole family can enjoy: the rule are simple, the cards are fun and colorful, and you can play it in under 20 minutes.&#10;&#10;Here's a quick overview of what the game is like: At the beginning of each turn, a &quot;Hole&quot; card is drawn. Each Hole card is worth a certain number of hole points if you win it, so you take a swing (i.e., roll the die) and give it your best shot. Everyone   gets a chance to swing, and everyone gets to play cards which affect that swing -- freaky weather, lucky gophers, hi-tech golf equipment and other zany events are sure to change the way you play golf.&#10;&#10;Did you win the Hole? Great! You're a few points closer to your winning goal of 18 hole points. If not -- no matter, you'll just have try again on the next Hole card... and get revenge on the opponent who nailed you with that nasty card last turn.&#10;&#10;";1997;5.13864;1.24
2903;The Hunt for Red October;"The Hunt for Red October depicts &quot;modern&quot; naval combat in the North Atlantic, Soviets vs. Nato.&#10;&#10;The game contains 8 scenarios that place various combinations of aircraft, surface ships, and submarines at the players' disposal. The map is broken up into irregular &quot;spaces&quot; containing land, shallow or deep sea. Land spaces may contain airbases and/or ports; sea spaces may contain standing detection patrols (SOSUS, etc).&#10;&#10;Pieces are double sided cardboard of 3 different sizes (capital ships/task forces, small ships/submarines, and aircraft) with the back only giving the basic information (a formation of aircraft, a submarine silhouette or a Task Force symbol) to keep the specific information of the unit secret from the opponent. Each unit has a detection rating and an attack rating.&#10;&#10;Each side starts each turn with a random number of detection attempts (2+d10 for NATO, 2+d6 for Soviet). Pieces are moved on the board (ships/subs up to 3 spaces, aircraft up to 1, 4, or 8 depending on type). As opposing pieces are moved into the same spaces, detection attempts are spent trying to locate the enemy units in the space (usually d10 &lt;= detection rating). Detected units are turned sideways so both sides can see it. Once units are found combat may be initiated.&#10;&#10;Combat is done in two attack phases. Dice are rolled vs. the attack rating of the attacking unit(s) (usually 1 d10 but there are exceptions) and hits are determined and resolved simultaneously. Ships that did not fire in the first phase conduct a second attack phase. Units can be in combat if not detected but upon firing become detected (which means undetected units almost invariably shoot in the second phase). Hits are again determined. 1, 2 or 3 hits (subs, small surface ships, large surface ships) are required to destroy a unit. Aircraft are destroyed only if the hit on them was a rolled 1 or 2. Victory is determined by scenario conditions. There are several optional rules, none of which appear to significantly increase the complexity of the game.&#10;&#10;";1988;6.00378;2.4717
2904;John Prados' Third Reich;"(from Avalanche Press website:)&#10;&#10;Third Reich interweaves not only the land, naval and air struggles, but also the equally important economic and political battles. Players must guide their nation to victory by capturing key objectives while making sure no one else &mdash; in particular their allies &mdash; gets there first.&#10;&#10;Players take on the leadership of Britain, France, Italy, Germany, the United States or the Soviet Union. Each of these major powers, in turn, can influence smaller countires like Turkey, Greece or Romania to join the war on their side. They can offer bribes or territory, and sometimes it&rsquo;s more important to decrease someone else&rsquo;s influence than to build up your own.&#10;&#10;The currency of the game is the Basic Resource Point, or BRP. This represents the financial, industrial and agricultural production needed to wage war. BRP&rsquo;s are used to build new units, to pay for offensives, to replace losses suffered in battle, to bribe minor countries, and for a host of other purposes. Each country&rsquo;s production can be affected by conquering or losing territory, or through strategic warfare (chiefly, attacks by submarines and bombers).&#10;&#10;Once activated (usually at a cost in BRP&rsquo;s), land, naval and air units can move and attack enemy units. Combat is resolved by rolling dice, with a result of 6 usually equalling a hit. There are no Combat Results Tables; every factor counts and there are no &ldquo;perfect numbers&rdquo; of units to commit to battle as in some wargames. When a land unit is hit, BRP&rsquo;s can be used to absorb some of the damage, but too many hits and it is reduced in strength or destroyed. Naval and air units pack a greater punch, but don&rsquo;t bounce back from damage as easily.&#10;&#10;Scenarios, or game situations, begin the game in 1938, 1939, 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944 or 1945. Political markers are randomly chosen to determine what events might take place outside the players&rsquo; control: Poland might capitulate to Germany in 1939, Mussolini, Churchill or Hitler might unleash some stupid scheme the Italian, British or German player will have to execute, oil could be found in Libya, the French navy could rally to the Allies or the Axis, jets can be developed, good Germans might kill Hitler &mdash; dozens of such events are possible.&#10;&#10;&#10;As one of the most popular games of all time, our edition of Third Reich has also spawned a sequel, Great Pacific War. The two games can be played together or separately.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;(BGG description:)Avalanche Press' re-release of the original classic. This is a significant overhaul based on the Avalon Hill Third Reich, and has nothing to do with the later Advanced Third Reich.&#10;&#10;There has been dramatic simplification and streamlining, however. Gone is the CRT, replaced by a Columbia-esque &quot;roll lots of dice&quot; combat resolution system. The whole front/option system has been revised with an &quot;HQ activation marker&quot; system: each nation buys activation markers for HQs, land, and air units, and puts them in a cup. Turn order is then determined by draws. Naval and air systems have been overhauled and simplified: sea zones now regulate movement. Tactical air support is now limited to being equal to the strength of the attacker/defender, not three times.&#10;&#10;Also includes 1938 (Spanish Civil War boils over to a general European conflict) and 1945 scenarios (Western Allies and Russia fall out after collapse of Germany).&#10;&#10;";2001;6.50482;4.0

2906;Jurassic Park III: The Spinosaurus Chase Game;"The object of the game is to get your pawn from its start space to the &quot;Final Escape&quot; space while avoiding the pursuing Spinosaurus.  Movement is handled through rounds of card play during which cards are played and then reacted to in order to eliminate all the cards in your hand.  Dinosaur cards have values ranging from 1-5 while Escape cards have values ranging from +1 to +3.  In order to play a Dinosaur atop another Dinosaur, it must be greater in value than the preceding card.  Escape cards may be played on any Dinosaur and these also allow you to play an additional Dinosaur card.&#10;&#10;Once someone has gone out, movement on the board (of players and the Spinosaurus) is based upon the last played card.&#10;&#10;If the Spinosaurus lands on your pawn, you are knocked back (not eliminated).&#10;&#10;First pawn/player to reach the Final Escape space wins.&#10;&#10;";2001;4.51515;1.0

Saxons and Normans fight to the death, as cavalry begins to emerge as the dominant force on the battlefield.&#10;&#10;LINCOLN pits King Stephen of England against the rebellious barons of the West and the Welsh border area; in 1141 they meet at Lincoln to determine the fate of the English crown.&#10;&#10;BOUVINES features the emerging force of nationalism under King Philip, against the forces of the Holy Roman Empire under Emperor Otto.&#10;&#10;MARCHFIELD saw the combined armies of Austria and Hungary massed to stop the onslaught of Ottokar of Bohemia, in one of the largest Cavalry battles of the era.&#10;&#10;";1992;6.24531;1.875
2918;The Last Crusade;"A quick yet realistic game of World War II combat that recreates the Allied campaign from the hedgerows of Normandy to the crossing of the Rhine and the capture of Germany's industrial heartland. As the commander of an army regiment, U.S. or German, you'll control platoon-sized elements of infantry, armor, artillery, air and support units, each represented by a playing card. Your goal: decisive victory with the overrun of the enemy's HQ (easiest to obtain if you command the well-provisioned invading Americans), or at the very least the crippling halt of your opponent's offensive (sometimes the only route to victory for the heavily-armed but somewhat beleaguered Germans). Either way, only shrewd tactics, careful use of resources, and the sheer guts of the battle-hardened separate the victorious from the defeated.&#10;&#10;Sold as starter decks (2 are the minimum for the game) and Booster Packs, this collectible card game evokes the feel of simple miniatures play.&#10;&#10;Starters and Boosters favor Rares well so collecting is easy.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.64953;2.625
2919;Search for the Emperor's Treasure;"Originally published in issue #51 (July 1981) of Dragon Magazine.&#10;&#10;A tongue-in-cheek version of &quot;classic&quot; Dungeons &amp; Dragons (some even say Mertwig's Maze is a similar treatment of Advanced D&amp;D).  As such, players become a warrior, elf, cleric, or magician, then wander around the board collecting treasure and resolving encounters.  The Emperor's six magic artifacts are both high-powered magic items and a countdown clock, as when enough have been found, the game ends. (Exactly how many depends on number of players.)&#10;&#10;Treasure, encounters and equipment are all randomized with chits in three cups. Characters obtain them by fighting monsters or lucky die rolls on result charts associated with various board locations (e.g., castles, villages, The Wizard's Tower, The Pirate Lair, etc.).  Not all encounters are monsters -- some are travelers who will bestow treasure upon completion of quests, others are annoyances, and there's even Imperial Guard patrols looking to confiscate the Emperor's Treasure.&#10;&#10;Terrain types are a key strategy feature, as a player whose current location's terrain doesn't match the encounter drawn can bestow it on someone else who does.  So a character in rugged forest or mountains can get stuck fighting several monsters in succession during other players' turns.&#10;&#10;A surprising amount of flavor is included for a magazine game.  There's an assortment of magic spells, ranged and close combat, magical weapons &amp; armor, damsels in distress, evil wizards, a volcanic demon, even a wandering elephant.&#10;&#10;A significantly revised version was published as part of The Best of Dragon Magazine Games.&#10;&#10;";1981;6.97137;1.7619

2921;The Game of Life;"This game attempts to mirror life events many people go through from going to college, raising a family, buying a home, working and retiring.&#10;&#10;The intent of the game is to have the most assets at the end of the game, assets are earned primarily by working and earning tokens with dollar amounts on them.  Additionally the first person to complete the course gets additional money tokens.&#10;&#10;There is a very linear board that you move along by spinning a wheel or landing on spaces that tell you to move to a specific space or forward or back.  There are a handful of intersections where you can choose to go one direction or another but they ultimately have similar spaces and meet back up quickly.  There are a handful of choices regarding insurance and investments but for the most part it is a game of luck.&#10;&#10;Note -- this entry covers many versions of the game with different rule sets.  In general, the newer the printing the gentler the rules.  The 1960s original can be quite brutal if the players choose to act on all the options made available to them.  The most recent versions are suitable for young children without parental supervision.&#10;&#10;";1960;4.35297;1.1699

All you need is a steady hand and creative thinking! The aim of the game is for each players to take turns adding a chair to the stack...chair upon chair...the tension mounts as the tower grows larger! Don't topple the CHAIRS or you're out of the game. If the chairs fall on your turn, you must take all of the chairs that fell.

2923;Listen Up!;"The game contains a deck of cards, each card contains a simple line drawing. Players take turns drawing a card and trying to get the others to copy the picture (and guess what it is) by describing it to them. The catch is you have to describe the drawing in geometric terms. For example, you can't say, &quot;Draw a smiley face.&quot; You have to say, &quot;Draw a circle. Put two dots next to each other inside the circle in the top half...&quot;&#10;&#10;";1997;5.55882;1.2
2924;Mr. Ree!:  The Fireside Detective;"This game is planned to give you all the thrills and excitement of a true detective mystery.  More than that, the game gives you an opportunity to play an exciting part in the creation of the plot, and the thrill of actually playing Detective; an eagerly sought opportunity to solve a baffling crime committed right under your very nose.  And, amazing as it may seem, the plot is never the same.&#10;&#10;Each player assumes the part of one of the Characters in AUNT CORA'S red brick house, and by his actions and positions in the house-hold follows thru with his likes and dislikes of the various persons with whom fate has placed him.  The player, represented on the board by a hollow token, roams about inside and outside the house, choosing and concealing weapons with which to commit a crime.  The strong arm of the law, in the person of Mr. Ree, is ever present patrolling the grounds surrounding the house.&#10;&#10;";1937;5.52857;2.0

Behind you, and closing in fast, is the murderous Fratelli Gang!&#10;&#10;In this game, every encounter is a test of courage.  To escape safely with your treasure, you'll need a bit of planning, some cagey maneuvers - and sometimes, just plain luck!&#10;&#10;";1985;5.81429;1.3333
2927;Slasher: The Final Cut;"At the beginning of the game, it is unknown who the slasher is.  The person whose turn it is plays a &ldquo;scene&rdquo; card.  This may allow movement, may allow an attack, may be a clue to the slasher's identity.  After the scene card is played, each player gets a chance to  play a &ldquo;plot twist&rdquo; on the scene.&#10;&#10;In the course of the game, the first person to get three clues becomes the Slasher, and the dynamics change a bit.&#10;&#10;The game continues until either the Slasher is dead or all player victims are dead.&#10;&#10;Hilariously fun social game.&#10;&#10;";1994;5.71538;1.6667

2930;The Game of Hoboken, New Jersey;"Another awful Monopoly ripoff, but at least for charity. This one has no hotels/houses, just bonuses for collecting groups, and has a unique &quot;lottery&quot; system for gambling your money.&#10;&#10;";0;0.0;0.0
2931;New York in a Box;"A monopoly (from Greek monos &mu;&#207;&#140;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf; (alone or single) + polein &pi;&omega;&lambda;&epsilon;&#225;&#191;&#150;&nu; (to sell)) exists when a specific person or enterprise is the only supplier of a particular commodity.&#10;&#10;Monopoly is a roll-and-move game where players move around the game board buying or trading properties, developing their properties with houses and hotels. When opponents land on players owned property, the owning player collects rent from the landing player. Owning sets of properties increases the rent paid to the player who owns them, by the player who lands on the square. The ultimate goal is to have the most money and drive opponents into bankruptcy.&#10;&#10;New York in a Box is a Monopoly clone, this one with New York City landmarks.&#10;&#10;";2004;4.08333;0.0
2932;Hnefatafl;"Hnefatafl, also known as The Viking Game, The King's Table or simply Tafl, is one of those two-player games where the opposing sides are not equal in number. The defending side comprises twelve soldiers and a king, who start the game in a cross formation in the center of the board. Their objective is for the king to escape by reaching any of the four corner squares. The attackers comprise 24 soldiers positioned in four groups of 6 around the perimeter of the board. All pieces move like the Rook in chess and pieces are taken by &quot;sandwiching&quot; i.e. moving your piece so that an opponent's piece is trapped horizontally or vertically between two of yours. There is a host of information on the Internet about Hnefatafl, including many rule variations that are worth experimenting with.&#10;&#10;A copy of the game was published in issue #128 of Dragon magazine, Dec 1987 (later republished as part of a boxed set: The Best of Dragon Magazine Games in 1990).&#10;&#10;One of the oldest games in the world - traced in various versions to the Vikings, Welsh, Saxons, and Irish. The origins of this game can be traced through Petteia, played by the Romans, to the even older versions played by the Ancient Greeks and Egyptians.&#10;&#10;Derivatives of Hnefatafl include Breakthru, Break Away, Seikkailu Merell&#195;&#164;, Tablut and Thud.&#10;&#10;";400;6.67254;2.5254

2935;Tashkent Domino;"Tashkent Domino is a pocket size 2 player placement game using dice. There are 9 dice with each face divided by a diagonal line. Either side of the lines are 0 to 3 dots. Players take 4 dice each and roll them once only, placing them according to the top face. The starting player rolls the 9th die and puts it in the center of the 3x3 grid. Players then alternately place one of their dice on the grid, so that adjacent dots match, playing when possible. When no more dice can be placed, whichever has the least wins. If the dice are equal, the least dots win. Play is open, so you plan your moves to block your opponents'.&#10;Easy.&#10;&#10;Professional Tashkent Domino is a larger variant played on a 5x5 grid.&#10;&#10;";1995;5.58714;1.0
2936;Dice Run;"Dice don't have legs, but in Dice Run they'll scamper as quickly as they can to get ahead of their fellow cubic cross-country runners. If you play your cards right, you'll be backing the winners and score thanks to their efforts.&#10;&#10;Dice Run includes thirty dice, with six dice in each of five different colors. To start the game, you roll these dice on the table to form the starting pack of runners. Each player has a hand of three movement cards and four secret target cards; these latter cards show a die with a particular number and color.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player plays a movement card and carries out its effect. If he chooses a red movement card, for example, all of the red dice &quot;break out&quot; of the pack and move ahead to form the leading group of runners. If the next player plays a 5 movement card, she first moves ahead all of the 5s from the leading group &ndash; thereby forming a new leading group &ndash; then she moves all the 5s from the next group in line ahead one group. Movement cards also allow players to switch the position of two non-leading groups, to drop a die from the leading group to the back of the pack, to flip all the dice in a group that match a particular number, to have three dice break out from the leading group, and so on. Alternatively, a player can place a movement card face down on the table, then roll all the dice in a non-leading group; he can't take this option again until another player makes such a roll. After playing a card, he refills his hand to three movement cards.&#10;&#10;A player can also choose to use one of his secret target cards to move the dice, first moving all the dice of the matching number, then all dice of the matching color, or vice versa. This card remains on the table.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, the movement deck is seeded with four stage cards valued 3-6. When a stage card is revealed, players each simultaneously reveal one of their secret target cards. (If a player used a target card for movement, he must choose this card.) For each die in the leading group that matches the color of this card, the player scores 1 point; he also scores 1 point for each matching number. If a die is identical to his target card, he scores 1 bonus point as well. Whoever has the highest score claims the stage card, which is worth 3-6 stage points. The players with the second- and third-highest scores receive 2 and 1 stage point.&#10;&#10;After four stages, the player with the most stage points wins!&#10;&#10;";2002;5.90278;1.413
2937;Diceland;"DICELAND is a strategy game for two players. At the beginning of the game, both players must agree on the number of hexagonal tiles that will form the &ldquo;land&rdquo; to be conquered. Beginners can start playing with few hexagons, while experienced players can use the complete set of 36 tiles. The dimension of the &ldquo;battlefield&rdquo; determines also the number of dice used by the players. In this game, dice are used as a sort of &ldquo;soldiers&rdquo; who will &ldquo;fight&rdquo; to conquer &ldquo;Diceland&rdquo;, although the game is definitely not a war game. Rules are very simple, and although the players have to roll a lot of dice during the game, only a good strategy can lead to a winning position. DICELAND can be played at different levels: the basic one will take only few minutes to be completed, while the most advanced can offer up to 45 minutes of entertainment, introducing the special terrain rules. The rulebook comes in 5 languages, full of pictures and with many game variants.&#10;&#10;";2002;5.52552;1.9524
2938;Zatre;"Zatre is short for Zahlen &amp; Treppen, numbers and steps. The publisher was obliged to replace the phrase &quot;scrabbling with numbers&quot; for &quot;dominoes for the 21st century&quot; on the box, but really it is just Scrabble with numbers. And very good for it, it is too. There are 121 tiles with 1-6 dots like a standard die or domino (20 of each number plus an extra 1). Players alternately draw and place 2 tiles on the board extending the pattern already laid. When you make a vertical or horizontal line that totals 10, 11 or 12 (12 is the limit), you score 1, 2 or 4 points accordingly on your game pad. Completing scoring lines on the pad gives a rising bonus and covering marked squares on the board gives you a doubling bonuses on your pad.&#10;&#10;Simple and quick, but surprisingly challenging when you get the idea. The idea being that you must keep an even, balanced score pad, scoring 10s and 11s, not just successive 12s. Easy to pick up, but it requires some effort to score well; spotting those opportunities to place one tile which scores each way, making sure you keep clocking up 10s, to turn into 11s or 12s. Luck does play a role, but good players consistently score highly game after game, so there must be something deeper at work.&#10;The publisher Perner maintains a website with play &amp; chat over the internet and there are several very active Zatre clubs in Germany, Austria &amp; Switzerland. Players results are scored on the ranking table on the website.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by: Zatre: Das Kartenspiel&#10;&#10;";1990;6.34835;2.0417

The overall game is played as a series of several small games some of which represent a sequence of action at the strategic level ('convoy operations') while alternate ones represent tactical actions (fjord raids) against Tirpitz in Altenfjord. In both types of action the rules for concealed movement are especially important.&#10;&#10;&#10;    2 maps: Strategic map showing the North Cape of Norway with a part of the Arctic Ocean, and a tactical map of Altenfjord.&#10;    1 die &#10;&#10;&#10;Strategic:&#10;&#10;    2 score markers&#10;    1 ops marker&#10;    1 time marker&#10;    1 weather marker&#10;    10 German scenario cards&#10;    60 markers for stacks of units&#10;    40 British and German unit counters &#10;&#10;&#10;Tactical:&#10;&#10;    72 unit counters including 16 dummies&#10;&#10;&#10;";1982;6.42;3.0
2940;A Dog's Life;"The object of the game is for a dog to locate four bones and carry them safely back to his home.   Bones tend to be found in trash cans and are sometimes given as rewards for successfully delivering newspapers to various establishments.  Players must also pay close attention to their bellies as their hunger level drops with each passing round.  So, finding food is also a top priority.&#10;&#10;Life on the streets is tough as not only must players search for food and bones, but they also must fend off rival dogs and that pesky dog catcher.&#10;&#10;";2001;5.56591;1.8281
2941;Romance of the Three Kingdoms Card Game;"From the publisher:&#10;&#10;No era in the millennia of Chinese History is as fascinating as that of the Three Kingdoms. It was a time of trouble, which gave birth to the most daring warriors, to strategists of unrivaled cunning, to many a legendary rogue &mdash; all household figures throughout Asia. Now, with                           117 cards and one d6, it is your turn to rise to                           the highest challenge! The fate of the Empire lies in your hands.&#10;&#10;The game does not only rely on sound tactics, it also promotes interaction between the players, who can strike a deal at any time. No two games can ever be the same: each one is a challenge, a renewed test of nerve and skills!&#10;&#10;The first player to have 6 points worth of land at the beginning of his turn is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;Hong Kong edition published 1999 in Chinese; US English edition published 2001.&#10;&#10;";1999;4.83036;1.5714
2942;Admirals;"A naval battle game where players position the ships of their fleet in order to engage in individual combat and capture of the enemy Admiral to win the game. Not quite a naval version of Stratego--there are significant rule differences.&#10;&#10;";1972;5.63967;1.6957

2944;Halli Galli;"Halli Galli is a speed action game in which players watch for sets of exactly five fruit. The deck contains 56 playing cards showing four kinds of fruit in groups of 1 to 5 and a bell of the type found at hotel reception desks.&#10;&#10;The deck is distributed evenly between the players. All players hold their deck face down and take turns dealing one card face up in front of them. As each player reveals her next card, the instant you see a total of five of one kind of fruit on the table, hit the bell. If you're correct, you pick up all the played cards and put them into your deck; if you're wrong, you pay the other players one card each. When you run out of cards, you're out. When two players are left, they play until the bell is struck once more, then the game ends and the taller deck wins.&#10;&#10;Keep in mind that a five-of-a-kind can occur both when cards are revealed and when they're covered. If, for example, cards showing 3, 1 and 4 bananas are on the table and the 3 is then covered by a non-banana card, suddenly five bananas are showing and somebody better be reaching for the bell.&#10;&#10;";1990;5.79717;1.0152
2945;Teufel nochmal!;"Players start with 8 cards and 8 wooden chips of various values (2 each of values 0, 1, 4, &amp; 7). The start player leads a card and then all players place a wood chip face down in front of them.  The winner of the trick will take all of the wooden chips and score them as points, so players play chips according to how likely they think they are to win the trick.&#10;&#10;Each player then plays a card in order (other than the start player, who has already played a card).  The trick is resolved using the paper/scissors/stone mechanism (using cards showing Gretel, Kasper, and a crocodile) [Punch, Judy, &amp; Crocodile in the English edition].  Teufel [devil] cards act as a trump. Whoever wins the trick takes the cards and the chips.&#10;&#10;After all tricks have been played, all cards are discarded except the crocodiles and the chips.  The chips are positive points for the players; the crocodiles are negative points.  Several hands are played, and the winner is the one with the most points at the end.&#10;&#10;";1987;5.09091;1.0
2946;Pipeline;"Pipeline is a surprisingly fun 3D pipe laying game. Presented as a kid's game, gamers will enjoy it as a light contest too. 4 players have colourful plastic sets of plumbing; straights, angles, T joints and capping pieces. Start from one side of the board, spin a spinner (or roll a special die) to select your piece and try to build a pipeline over to ending points on the opposite side. You can rotate your pipeline if required, but not backtrack, so when your neighbour's pipe gets in your way, you have to build over or around. First to connect wins.&#10;&#10;Note: This game page is only for the 6x6 versions.

2947;Broker;"Buy and sell stock shares. By play of Market Action cards, strategically manipulate prices to your advantage and to the downfall of your opponents. Win by having the most money in cash and stocks after the last card has been played. But be careful: if all of your remaining stock holdings crash, it is possible to be eliminated before the game is even over.&#10;&#10;Originally published in 1961 as Broker by the Spencer-Murray Corporation of Swarthmore, Pennsylvania.&#10;&#10;The original box is white, with lettering and logo in black, very basic, drab, and uninspiring. Yet this obscure title was quite a gem considering the limitation of games to choose from during its day.&#10;&#10;In 1967 it was re-published by the German firm Otto Maier Verlag, which is the ancestor of Ravensburger Verlag. Numerous re-publications followed (1972, 1977 and others) including at least one which gave the rules in German, English and Italian. It was also published in the Ravensburger Casino Series.&#10;Components list for these editions are as follows: 160 stock certificates, 68 Market Action cards, 4 price markers, play money, stock price board.&#10;&#10;The 1983 (9th edition) by Ravensburger changes the title slightly to B&ouml;rsenspiel instead of Das B&ouml;rsenspiel and the original rules heavily. Although this set is well-designed and much nicer on the eyes, the bland original version featured larger (regular card deck) size action cards. An extra set of 18 &quot;risk&quot; cards replacing 18 market cards had been added and they act as event cards that immediately effect changes in the market. They cause the unfortunate player who draws one to play it instead of a market card, a chaotic effect that some players will not like.&#10;&#10;";1961;5.82616;2.0435

Six of the colors correspond to question categories while the last color gives a new dice roll. Six spaces along the track are &quot;pie spaces&quot;, and from these there are &quot;spokes&quot; of track leading to the middle of the board.&#10;&#10;Players roll a die and move along the track in any direction they like. When a player stops on a color they get a question of the appropriate category. If the player answers a question correctly while on a pie space, they get a pie of that color (assuming they don't already have it). A correct answer on another square allows the player to roll again.&#10;&#10;Once the player has one pie in each color, she can move along the spokes to the middle of the board to win the game.&#10;&#10;";1981;5.25093;1.6329

2954;Supremacy: Colonial Legions and Merchant Marine;"Use Your Colonies to Supply Resources and Men &#10;When you build armies, the number of troops you can deploy is limited by the number of territories you occupy. Now your colonies are important for their raw resources and manpower. The more countries you occupy, the more men you can send to war. When you need troops, you can draft any rogue from any colony.&#10;&#10;Get Resources Quick, But Not Cheap &#10;Use your merchant marine to ship your grain oil or minerals in a hurry. You can even get your precious cargoes when you're under attack. The more merchant ships you own, the more resources you can ship. If you have the ships and the money, you can buy anything, from anywhere.&#10;&#10;Secure Your Sea Lanes or Else&#10;Beware! The enemy may use his warships and subs to sink your merchant ships. Your days of war are numbered if you're cut off from your supplies of grain, oil and minerals. Remember: no ships, no sales, no money, no victory.&#10;&#10;Playing Equipment &#10;Colonial Legions and Merchant Marine come in eight different sets of cubes and oblongs, color matched to a superpower or middle power. Each cube represents one colonial legion or army. Each oblong represents one merchant ship or navy. &#10;Decals with the letter &bdquo;M&quot; are provided to identify merchant ships. Each player receives twenty decals and places one decal on each of his merchant ships. &#10;Mushroom clouds (18) are black and are shaped like mushrooms. A cloud is used to mark where a nuclear bomb has exploded.&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;    Supremacy: The Game of the Superpowers&#10;&#10;&#10;";1994;5.68269;3.0
2955;Mexica;"Mexica plots the development of the city of Tenochtitlan on an island in Lake Texcoco. Players attempt to partition it into districts, place buildings, and construct canals.&#10;&#10;Districts are formed by completely surrounding areas of the island with water and then placing a District marker. The player who founds a district scores points immediately.&#10;&#10;Canals and Lake Texcoco act as a quick method of moving throughout the city. Players erect bridges and move from one bridge to the next, which costs 1 action point regardless of the distance. They must also erect buildings. This costs action points, the exact number being dependent upon the building's size.&#10;&#10;In the scoring phases of the game, players score points (El Grande style) based upon their dominance in a District. In the 4 player game, players with the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd most buildings score decreasing numbers of points.&#10;&#10;Only districts are scored in the first scoring round.&#10;&#10;In the second scoring round at the end of the game, all land areas are scored, not just districts.&#10;&#10;The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Mexica is the third game in the Mask Trilogy.&#10;&#10;";2002;7.2406;2.674
2956;Dirty Minds: The Game of Naughty Clues;"DIRTY MINDS  The Game of Naughty Clues... is also known as &quot;The world's cleanest dirty game.&quot; The dirtier a mind you have, the worse you will be at playing DIRTY MINDS because all of the answers are clean!&#10;&#10;A player draws a card, and reads one of the facts about the word (they may choose). Then the other player gets to make one free guess. If they're right, they get three letter cards. If they're wrong, the other players get a chance to steal. If they guess the word, they get one letter card. If they have cards, and get it wrong they lose a letter card. If no one guesses the word, another clue is read. If no one gets it the next time around the players will only receive one letter card from that point on.&#10;&#10;Letter cards can be the letters D, I, R, T, or Y; they can also be ~ cards, Wild cards, or Action cards. Players win when they can spell DIRTY.&#10;&#10;DIRTY MINDS will provide two or more adults with hours of laughter as seemingly filthy clues point towards the most innocent of answers. Some people say a dirty mind is a terrible thing to waste. Use yours to play DIRTY MINDS, but remember...

2960;Camden;"Camden is a game about drawing and laying cards (acting as tiles) to form a highly abstracted street market. What sets the game apart from other games in the tile-laying genre is that the cards can be placed almost anywhere on the board and in almost any orientation.  Cards may touch at corners, and the corner of one card may touch the side of another.&#10;&#10;Players advance by purchasing stores formed by the cards and collecting revenue from those stores at the beginning of each subsequent turn. Symbols on cards may trigger effects when drawn, either destroying or emptying the largest store, or giving players bonus payouts.&#10;&#10;Victory is achieved by the first player to reach 50 points.&#10;&#10;Since revenue comes from the quality of your store, but other players can play tiles to alter that store, the overall result is a cutthroat mind-bender, making it one of the most popular games of Cheapass&#039;s Hip Pocket Games series. The game was originally released as Agora in 2002, with the theme of an ancient Greek marketplace.&#10;&#10;";2002;6.27009;1.9091
2961;Confusion: Espionage and Deception in the Cold War;"A strategic two-player abstract with a heavy deduction element.  At the start of the game, neither player knows how their own pieces move.  Via performing attempted moves, each player tries to deduce the movement of their own pieces.  As you determine how to move your pieces, your goal is to capture the neutral piece, initially located in the center of the board, and deliver it to your opponent's side of the board.&#10;&#10;From the new Stronghold Games version, Confusion: Espionage and Deception in the Cold War:&#10;&#10;The Cold War.  A dangerous time for the world.  A dangerous time to be a spy... but that is exactly what being a spy is all about.  As the shadowy clouds of intrigue and subterfuge settle across the globe you have been called upon by your country to obtain the Top Secret information that will ensure your country's safety and supremacy.  But not all is as it seems; your spies are difficult to control on a global scale, and even worse, there's a Double Agent in your midst who threatens the entire mission!&#10;&#10;At the start of a game of Confusion, players aren't aware of the talents and skills their own spies possess!  Your opponent can see what your spies can do, but you cannot.  Your job as a wise leader is to first deduce exactly how each of your spies move, then employ your knowledge by using each spy for maximum effect.  But be on alert, because your opponent has placed a double-agent in your team of spies! The first player to take the Top Secret Briefcase from the middle of the board and deliver it to his opponent's capital is the winner.&#10;&#10;Can you achieve your goals at the expense of your opponent, or will the entire operation collapse in a sea of Confusion?&#10;&#10;Confusion is game #1 in the Stronghold Games &quot;Castle Line&quot;.&#10;&#10;";1992;7.05378;2.4086
2963;Stockmarket;"A game in which players try to make the most money by trading on the stock market. Players take turns to trade shares in 6 UK companies using information on share price movements available only to you. But every player has different information, hence decisions will be based not only on your cards, but also on the actions of the other players. This calls for guessing and bluffing. &#10;The game is played in a series of trading periods (called Bargain Periods). At the end of each, all players 'pool' their information and this forms the basis of the actual market price movements on each share. By gaining a larger percentage of a company's shares, a player can become Company Director or even Chairman and exert some personal influence on that company's share price. At the end of up to 10 trading periods, players calculate their total value to find the winner.&#10;&#10;";1987;6.83731;2.5
2965;Kendo;"The game first was published in 1974  as Queen Bee by Condor, before it was re-themed and published by 'Ravensburger' &#10;as  Kaiser, K&#195;&#182;nig, Edelmann in 1976 &#10;and re-themed again in 1989 as Kendo.&#10;_________________________________________&#10;Kendo, The Samurai's Favourite Game, lets 4 Samurai fight across a hex grid to get their Prince safely into the palace at the centre. Your 8 figures are numbered 1 (Prince), 2 (Samurai) or 3 (Fighter) and may only move their number of spaces. Finishing a move on an opponent's piece is a strike and it is removed from the board. Strike a prince and the player is out of the round, though their pieces remain on the board. Get your Prince to the centre and score 5 bonus points, whilst all remaining pieces score their value. Play a few rounds and most points win.&#10;Interesting abstract game, was very popular in Germany and often reprinted.&#10;&#10;Description for Kaiser, K&ouml;nig, Edelmann (Emperor, King, Nobleman):&#10;Each player tries to be the first to reach the castle with his prince. At the beginning of play the figures are arranged according to a certain starting order. The player, whose turn it is, moves one of his figures as many fields as it is allowed (3,2,1). If the figure moves onto a field with an opposing figure, this one is struck and taken out of the play. If it takes an opposing emperor out of the play in this way, that player is immobilized completely; his figures however remain in the game as handicaps. One may not jump over figures. Likewise it is not allowed to move through the palace or go back to the spot you came from. Additionally the player is obliged to move every turn. The emperor can move only to one crossing, the kings to two crossings and the noble men up to three crossings. The player whose emperor first arrives at the castle wins.&#10;&#10;";1976;6.06243;2.3889

2975;Origins of World War II;"Origins of World War II is an Avalon Hill bookcase game. A game in which the players take the roles of the major powers of World War II in the 1930s. Each attempts to achieve its diplomatic objectives while preventing the other players from gaining theirs. If Germany or the USSR win World War II starts, if one of the allied powers wins the war would have been prevented.&#10;&#10;The game is played in a series of six turns (the final one being December 1939), actions are resolved via the diplomatic conflict table by comparing the diplomatic points of the attacker vs. those of the defender in each given area (Poland, Romania, etc).&#10;&#10;Several different &quot;What if&quot; policies are available such as Strong Franco-British alliance, Aggressive French policy and the Anti-Bolshevik Crusade.&#10;&#10;Includes a good chronology of the actual diplomatic moves made by each of the major powers leading up to the second world war.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 1&#10;&#10;The german Schmidt Spiele edition &quot;Diplomatie&quot; was published as a game of the Schmidt Spiele-Bar series in book case format.&#10;&#10;";1971;6.03435;2.0476

2981;Breaking Away;"Breaking Away is a luck-free race game based on cycling. Players control a team of four cyclists. For each cyclist the player chooses one of his available movement allowances and moves that many squares. Once all cyclists have moved, the expended movement allowances are replaced with new ones calculated according to the cyclist's position in the peloton; being at the back of a group brings a high replacement value, and being at the front a low one.&#10;&#10;Sprint points are earned by being among the first eight to cross the sprint lines so there is always a trade-off between slipstreaming (&quot;drafting&quot;) the other riders in order to build up high movement allowances and making a break for the front to be the first to cross the finish line.&#10;&#10;Note: The first edition from Fiendish Games comes with six teams, but additional teams can be ordered to allow for games with up to twelve people; the additional colors are orange, pink, purple, brown, silver, and gold.

2985;Train Raider;"Train Raider is a board game designed and produced in Japan.  It has some parallels to the Empire Builder systems in that you build networks by drawing on the board, but the similarities don't extend too far beyond that.  The winner is the player who receives the most &quot;honor points&quot;, and you can gain honor points in three different ways:&#10;&#10;1.  Building your network to connect to more towns, cities, and big cities&#10;2.  Destroying other people's trains during missions&#10;3.

2987;Pirate's Cove;"Come aboard and sail to Pirate's Cove, the legendary hideaway of thieving pirates and cutthroat buccaneers. The tales of those legendary pirates of old who've fought and survived these mysterious waters still haunt all those who yearn for a life at sea. Armed with a secret map and starting with a modestly outfitted sloop salvaged from last winter's storm, you set sail to Pirate's Cove, your eyes filled with visions of treasure and fame, your lungs filled with the salty air of the high seas.&#10;&#10;Your objective: to battle for the rights to plunder and become the most famed and feared pirate the world has ever seen. To do so, you will need to navigate shrewdly, fight recklessly and pillage mercilessly. You will gain fame by winning battles; burying gold and treasure; and bragging about your exploits at the tavern. At the end of twelve months, the pirate with the most fame will be declared the most fearsome pirate of the high seas!&#10;&#10;The game has 12 turns and at the start of every turn, each pirate must decide (secretly) which of the six islands they will visit. All players reveal their navigation directions simultaneously and then the turn is resolved. If any two or more pirates end up at the same island, Combat ensues.&#10;&#10;Combat resolution is determined by the strengths of your ship and the results of cannon fire (dice). The goal of combat is to scare away rival pirates so that you are the only pirate left at the island. If you stay in combat too long, your ship will suffer and make subsequent turns more difficult, so there is a fine balance of when to stay and fight and when to let the bigger ship have its booty. If you flee from combat, you end up at Pirate's Cove where you receive a small compensation for the turn. Once all conflicts are resolved, then the bounty for each island is given out.&#10;&#10;Each island (except Pirate's Cove and Treasure Island) offer various amounts of Fame, Gold, Treasure or Tavern cards. The bounty is skewed so that some Islands are clearly better choices than others, so it can force you to decide (or bluff) if you think you can take the island should other pirates go after the same bounty. Once you have your bounty, you can purchase upgrades for your ship. Each Island offers a different ship component. The four parts of your ship are: Sails (determines speed and initiative in combat), Hull (how much treasure you can carry), Crew (needed to man the cannons), and Cannons. (The lower number of Crew and Cannons determines how many dice you roll in combat).&#10;&#10;There is also an island with a Pub that offers useful strategy cards to help you in all aspects of the game. The last island is treasure island which offers no real bounty other than the chance to bury treasures that you have in the hull of your ship. Buried treasure is converted to Fame (which is the ultimate goal of the game).&#10;&#10;Other random elements of the game include the dreaded Legendary Pirates who are highly dangerous ships that patrol the islands in order. One of 5 different Legendary Pirates (which include famous names like Blackbeard and The Flying Dutchman) is drawn at the beginning of every game, and stays until defeated. If you end up at the same island as one of them, you had better have a strong ship and helpful allies or they will blast you with their powerful cannons. However, if you can manage to sink their ships, you can score a good amount of fame! But beware, once you defeat him/her a new Legendary Pirate will appear to wreck havoc in the islands.&#10;&#10;At the very end of the game, there is a chance for everyone to tell &quot;tall tales&quot; about themselves to increase their final fame standings. These tall tale cards are gained at the pub and offer yet another fun &quot;pirate&quot; mechanic. In all, Pirate's Cove offers you the chance to truly play like a pirate where you can fight and plunder your way to victory.&#10;&#10;";2002;6.55503;2.005

There are a couple of completely new kinds of tiles: the inns and cathedrals.  There are also new tiles that present cities, roads, and cloisters in new shapes.

2997;Soldier Kings: The Seven Years War Worldwide;"From the Avalanche Press website:&#10;&#10;The Seven Years' War Worldwide&#10;&#10;Between 1756 and 1763, Europe erupted into what became the first true world-wide conflict, known as the Seven Years&rsquo; War. On the one hand, Britain and France vied for supremacy in world-wide trade, becoming deadly enemies in the process. On the other, Austria and Prussia struggled for dominance in Germany. On the fringes, Russia began to feel her growing power, while Spain, the Netherlands and Turkey all knew their time was almost up.&#10;&#10;Soldier Kings re-creates the free-for-all that was the Seven Years&rsquo; War. Two to eight players take the roles of the nations listed above, trying to capture or hold onto the rich lands of Europe, India, South-East Asia and America. The world is changing; the power that grabs the most now will dominate the modern age that is just dawning. If you&rsquo;re the Soldier King, that power will be you.&#10;&#10;In Soldier Kings, each player has armies and fleets. There are also a handful of generals and admirals to assist these in battle and in movement. The best is Frederick of Prussia, called &ldquo;The Great&rdquo; for a reason. The worst is the hapless Prince of Orange, with whom the Dutch player is saddled.&#10;&#10;Players have allies; some are set at the beginning of the game, others alliances are forged during the course of play. Everyone else is an enemy. No one is &ldquo;neutral&rdquo;; those are just enemies you haven&rsquo;t attacked yet.&#10;&#10;The map is divided into land areas and sea zones. Armies move on land, fleets at sea. Each land area is rated for the amount of money and manpower it generates each turn. Manpower represents not just fresh recruits for your forces, but also the things made with human labor: food, uniforms, weapons and so on. Money is, well, money. You expend manpower to rebuild your forces, and money to finance their actions. Thus you need to hang on to areas that generate these resources for you, and take them from the other guy.&#10;&#10;You do that by defeating enemy armies, and besieging enemy areas. Combat is conducted by rolling dice, one for each attack factor. These hits must be sustained by enemy armies by reducing them in strength, or eliminating them. A good general lets you roll more dice. Each area is rated for its garrison strength; to capture it, you have to defeat the garrison troops through siege (in addition to driving off any enemy armies there). The procedure here is very similar.&#10;&#10;Throwing a twist into all of this is card play. The universe is loaded with random elements; life does not unfold as an orderly series of &ldquo;phases.&rdquo; After a short countdown to start the game, players can play cards at any time, in any order.&#10;&#10;The cards are the centerpiece of the game, giving it its free-wheeling nature. Generals can vacillate. Mercenaries can be hired. Local militia can appear to help. Soldiers might run off to loot. Bridges get burned, snow falls early, the harvests are bad, the harvests are good. Royal marriages, minor country alliances, the rise of new leaders &mdash; all sorts of events take place during card play.&#10;&#10;The game contains seven scenarios: a campaign game covering the entire war, and then six shorter ones, one for each year of the war. Play ends on a pre-determined turn or when a player has achieved his or her conditions for automatic victory, whichever comes first.&#10;&#10;";2002;6.3694;2.4651

The game plays like Go, except that stones are bought for varying prices based on the area of the board they will be deployed to.  Three decks of cards provide monetary income for buying more stones and also good and bad events that must be dealt with.  Think of the game as Go combined with some aspects of Monopoly, notably the money and the Chance and Community Chest cards.&#10;&#10;The game was issued in at least two editions - a standard rectangular box set, and a set packaged in a plastic violin case.&#10;&#10;";1971;5.89718;2.3333

These skills determine how well each player can perform actions like Passing, Kicking and Gathering the ball.&#10;&#10;On their turn each player can move any or all of their players in any direction a certain distance (governed by their position and relative skill), rolling dice to perform actions such as kicking or passing the ball when necessary.&#10;&#10;Also, special 'Pressure Play' cards offer additional moves and actions your players can make in pursuit of victory.&#10;&#10;";2001;7.67806;2.4688

3007;Noteability;"Noteability is a party game for the older generation. The game has a genuine Grand Piano on which you play tunes for the others to guess. OK, it's a small, plastic, battery powered Grand Piano with a numbered keypad. Draw a card, select the category (TV, Golden Oldies, Trad, Film &amp; Musicals) and follow the numbers, trying to get the rhythm right and see if your granny knows The Magic Roundabout.&#10;The thing is, it actually works and is fun to play! The piano is excellent and getting the pacing of the tunes makes all the difference. Sadly no nu metal, gangsta rap or hardcore house, so not a game for anyone under 30.&#10;&#10;";1990;4.61853;1.1818
3009;King of the Mountain;"(From the introduction) King of the Mountain is a moderate skill-level strategy game for 2 to 10 players, Ages 8 and up. The object of the game is to be the first player to have his/her character reach the Citadel at the top of the mountain, which is the center hex of the game board. Players guide their character-counter from the board's edge, which is the base of the mountain, along paths and through tunnels in order to get to the peak. Attempting to stop the players is a malevolent Wizard, played by one of the players. The Wizard controls the different monsters on the mountain, causing them to seek out the characters and do battle with them. The object for the Wizard player is to see that no one reaches the Citadel. Depending on the number of players, the game should last between 45 minutes (two players)and 3 hours (10 players).&#10;&#10;(additional comments) One of the nice things is that each character can customize the stats and equipment of their characters.&#10;&#10;";1980;3.82353;2.3333

3029;Sheffield Shares;"A standard Monopoly clone with share holding and price variation, the interest in this game lies in its design and production. Funded entirely by sponsorship from local firms who feature on the board and stocks, lead by the Midland Bank who got their logo on the banknotes, this game was actually produced by Sheffield YMCA with help from the City Council. Sheffield YMCA got the idea from Bergen YMCA, where apparently this style of game was a big hit in Norway, with 200,000 copies sold, the result being that all proceeds from sales went to the charity. The product is very good quality, very professional, with an unusual feature of the game board wrapping around a polystyrene contents box to form the game box like a sleeve, held by Velcro! Very strange, with the cardboard held in hinged sections in strong plastic, but the innovative &amp; modern design works very well and the result is much more interesting than many British games.&#10;Still a Monopoly clone though.&#10;&#10;";1989;3.36;1.0

3033;Bus Boss;"Bus Boss is a follow up to Railway Rivals/Dampfross that is simpler and plays faster.&#10;&#10;Similarly to RR, the players draw routes they control on a map in the first part of the game and race to/from randomly determined cities.  There are some important differences.&#10;&#10;In the building phase:  Instead of building a short section of track each turn, players buy an entire route between 2 cities.  The price of the route is determined by its length + $2.  This continues until one player has less than $50 left.  This speeds up the building phase considerably.&#10;&#10;In the racing phase:  All players who compete in the race receive a share of a pot of $30.

3035;The Last Days of the Grande Armee: The Four Days of Waterloo;"The time is: 1630 hrs., 15 June 1815...The Imperial Guard light cavalry of Lefebvre-Desnottes encountered the Nassau infantry of Bernhard, Duke of Saxe-Weimar. The Duke had taken the initiative to move one of his two regiments south from the vital crossroads of Quatre-Bras, in the rolling countryside of Flanders, to delay the lead elements of the French advance.&#10;&#10;The French horsemen found the village of Frasnes occupied by a regiment of 1500 Orange-Nassau infantry. The Guard troopers began to ride around the town on both sides, threatening a double envelopment. Observing this, the Nassauers started to withdraw back up the road toward Waterloo.&#10;&#10;The Guard Chasseurs Regiment, 1100 men under the command of General Francois Lallemand, pursued them off the road into the woods of Bossu, capturing 15 men.&#10;At the same time, the 800 Lancers of the Guard continued straight for Quatre-Bras itself. Their commander, General Colbert de la Chabanais, rode behind with a small escort, into the walled-farm of Genioncourt.&#10;&#10;By pre-arranged signal, the 2600 troops of the 2nd Nassau Regiment, who remained in Quatre-Bras, set fire to a beacon and fired their 8 guns, alerting the rest of the Anglo-Allied army further up the road, toward Waterloo. As the Lancers approached the crossroads, the two Nassau regiments in the town and in the woods on their flank kept up a fire of musketry which made it impossible for them to remain in their exposed position on the open road.&#10;&#10;Had the Lancers succeeded in hustling the Duke's Nassau troops from Quatre-Bras as they had done in at Frasnes, the battle to be fought there the next day would have been a defensive one for the French.

3041;Panzergruppe Guderian;"&quot;Panzergruppe Guderian&quot;: The Battle of Smolensk, July 1941, is a wargame simulation of the German campaign to capture Smolensk in July, 1941.  The game is played in twelve turns, each one representing 2 days time, on a map scale of 10.5 km/hex.&#10;&#10;This wargame is famous for its innovative use of &quot;untried&quot; Soviet units.  These untried Soviet counters enter play face down, their combat strength unknown to either player, until they take part in combat, at which time they are flipped to reveal their strength and defense numbers.&#10;&#10;The game also models the effectiveness of German operations by allowing them a full mechanized movement phase both before and after combat, while the Soviets only move prior to combat.  In addition, if all of a German division's regiments attack or defend in the same hex, their strength is doubled by a divisional integrity bonus.&#10;&#10;The German player scores victory points for the capture of cities, and for any Soviet units redirected from the Southwestern Front.  The Soviet player scores vp for recaptured cities and destroying entire German divisions (which possess several steps of strength).&#10;&#10;The game includes: 1 map, counters (AH edition = 260; SPI edition = 200), 1 6-sided die, 1 Soviet reference card, 1 German reference card, 1 rules book, and 1 advanced rules insert.&#10;&#10;";1976;7.36694;2.7938

3045;Pentantastar;"Players control the East and the West factions. Either East or West can win by military or by magic forces. Armies of mounted and foot soldiers and fleets of ships contest victory by capturing key places. But even a military victory depends upon control of magic. As magic releases powers of earth, air, water, light, and fire, the wizards grow in strength, volcanoes erupt, storms sweep the mountains and seas, and the creatures of magic join the struggle for both sides. When all five charms are assembled, the completed Pentantastar is a dangerous weapon. If carried to Lug Balor, the East wins, if carried to the Wizard Council, the West wins. Victory depends upon taking advantage of military and magic opportunities, and surviving immediate threats, disasters, and treachery.&#10;&#10;";1983;5.68769;2.1667
3047;Rails Through the Rockies;"Railroad game on track construction in Colorado. The emphasis is on finding the fastest and most profitable route from the eastern states to Grand Junction. Money to build is earned by creating a rail network to cities, towns and mines, with the mining being rather abstract(mines open and close as random events). Players must worry about the details of track types, passes and tunnels. In addition, there is an events deck which has a large effect on play. As there are really only about three good ways through the mountains, this is the optimal number of players.&#10;&#10;In 1995 Winsome Games released Rocky Mountain Rails as an expansion kit to the game.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Rocky Mountain Rails&#10;&#10;&#10;";1981;5.63095;3.125

3053;Bonaparte in Italy;"In the Winter of 1796, Napoleon Bonaparte was commander of the Reserve Army, a politically visible and published critic of conduct on the ongoing war against the First Coalition.&#10;Through he had no apparent qualifications, his close proximity to the Directory and the influence of his freshly-made bride earned him the command of the quiescent Army of Italy, his first field command, at the age of 26. At once he turned his deep theoretical understanding, in a lightning campaign, against the tottering Sardinian Kingdom and its ally, Austria. By the end of April, he had gained for his army a corner of the fertile Po Valley. From there, in a series of six further operations over the next ten months, the French Army conquered and successfully defended the remainder of the Valley and the key to an advance into Austria, the fortress of Mantua.&#10;&#10;Rules: 24 pages incl.

Pieces stacked three high may not be struck. It is also unique that pieces may move forward and backward on the field.&#10;&#10;";1976;7.0;1.5
3057;Warp 6;"Warp 6 is a mostly abstract race game where players have a fleet of starships (which are represented 4-, 6-, and 8-sided dice) trying to go down a spiral path to the center wormhole. During a turn a player moves one of his or her ships along the the spiral exactly the number on the die.  A player can choose to change the number on a die up or down by one instead of moving.&#10;&#10;The game revolves around attempting to land on other ships (friendly or otherwise) which allows sliding down at least one loop of spiral until it reaches an unoccupied spot, thus cutting out a lot of transit time.  When this happens, the die is rolled before it is placed in its landing spot to receive a new number. Typically, long chains are formed which can be taken advantage of by all players. Knowing when to form, break, take advantage of, and foil the use of these chains is the key to winning.&#10;&#10;In the three-player version, the first player to get 4 of their 6 ships out wins.

3061;Samurai: Warfare in the 16th Century Japan;"(from GMT website:)&#10;&#10;Samurai is the fifth entry in the award-winning Great Battles of History series and is easily the most exotic and visually stunning. Samurai covers all the major battles of the Sengoku Jidai (the Age of Warring Daimyos). Japan was truly a country at war. Because of the nature of 16th century Japanese warfare, it is also the easiest game in the series to play. The revamped command system simulates the clan-oriented levels of leadership, plus simplified shock and fire mechanics. Also included are individual samurai used to challenge opponents and collect the important severed heads. Ignore the challenge and lose face, or even be forced to commit seppuku on the spot.&#10;&#10;Battles include the most unusual Okehazama, complete with burning castles, thunderstorms, and a historically victorious army out-numbered six to one; Anegawa; Kawanakajima; Mikata-ga-Hara; Nagashino, with the famous Takeda cavalry corps charging Oda's volley-firing musketeers; and the most famous battle to take place in Japan, Sekigahara.

3067;James Clavell's Shogun Card Game;"In this mini-series tie-in card game, 3-7 players in the basic game and 3-8 players in the advanced game try to score points by collecting cards not unlike in traditional card games. The artwork features characters from the movie &quot;Shogun&quot;, and the game can be played in a simple (beginner) or an advanced version, which makes use of all the cards.&#10;&#10;There are two &quot;colors&quot; of cards, peasants and samurai, which are organized into several subclasses like Farmer, Servant, Samurai Wife, or Hatamoto, which all have different point values. Basically, you try to score points by getting either a complete hand of one color (but no doubles), or several cards of the same type. Furthermore, there are wild cards like the Priest, the Emperor, the Heir and of course the Shogun which all have special values in certain combinations. Several other cards like a joker (the &quot;Buddha&quot;) or an elimination card (the &quot;Ninja&quot;) are also part of the deck. Unlike many other card games, you don't hold the cards in your hand; four of your five cards are displayed face up in front of you, while the fifth lies face down to be kept secret till the end of the turn. This makes bluffing as important a factor as luck and strategy in this game.&#10;&#10;But that's not all. Right before the end (and before revealing their face-down card), players can choose a final strategy, represented by small strategy markers. &quot;Passive&quot; means you get the points your hand is worth (if any), while &quot;Power Play&quot; can double your score (or even turn a zero point hand into 20 points), but only if either you're the only one to play &quot;Power Play&quot;, or if you're the player with the highest score this round. For every other &quot;Power Player&quot; there's a hefty point penalty.&#10;&#10;There are even more special cards that I won't go into detail about (such as the &quot;Spy&quot; or the &quot;Hostage&quot;), as well as an intricate turn sequence that allows players to play their cards almost simultaneously. Also, the deck is only reshuffled when all the cards have been used up, which may take a few rounds and will make sure that certain powerful cards only show up ever so often, and not always in the right order to be played.&#10;&#10;Another noteworthy part of this game is it's unique atmosphere. The rules successfully impose a courteous oriental gameplay where cards aren't simply dealt, but offered, and where Favors can be used to influence a hand. At the same time, there's always the shadow of the Ninja looming over the table, and even though it rarely strikes, it can re-arrange the whole score sheet.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player has reached 500 points (or 1,000 points for &quot;epic games&quot;). A regular game lasts about 45 minutes.&#10;&#10;";1983;6.25513;2.0
3069;Triangle Game;"This is a game designed for exactly three players played on a triangular board which looks like Serpinski's gasket.  Each player is attempting to get their pieces to their home territory.  The catch is they don't start with any of their pieces, having to rely on their opponents to place them.  During a turn, a player first places a piece from her pool, and then moves one of her pieces on the board by sliding it along the edges of the triangles.

3073;Just Wait;"The deck has 96 cards, 90 of value 1-7, with more of the lower value cards and fewer of the higher values.&#10;Each is decorated with different timepieces: a watch, a metronome, a stopwatch and so on.&#10; There are also six 'Parking Meter' cards with a star rather than a number. The aim of play is to meld sets of three &#10;cards, scoring the face value of melded cards at the end of the hand. The Parking meters are wild cards,&#10;which can be used when melding cards, but score nothing at the end of the hand.&#10;&#10;Players have two ways of gaining cards - the first thing they do each turn. They may discard a card and take as many cards as its face value from the draw pile. Alternatively, they may play one or more '1's and take that many cards from the discard pile. The drawback to the latter is that they must then meld at least one of the cards&#10;taken. Players are also limited to a maximum of 12 cards in their hand at the end of their turn and must&#10;discard any excess.&#10;&#10;Having taken card(s), players may then make a meld - only one meld is allowed each&#10;turn.&#10;&#10;";1998;5.90278;1.3333

3085;Gang of Four;"Gang of Four&trade; is an exciting game of Cunning, Strategy and Power. The game's premise is simple - be the first to rid yourself of all your cards and ascend to supreme power. But beware - a strategic misstep may find you in a struggle to survive.&#10;&#10;History&#10;The term, Gang of Four, was first used to describe four powerful radicals in Communist China that rose to power during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) and dominated Chinese politics during the early 1970s. Led by Jiang Qing, a former actress and the power-hungry wife of Chairman Mao, the Gang of Four dominated political, economic and cultural life in China for years. One month after Mao's death, they were arrested and jailed, thus ending China's slide into radicalism.&#10;&#10;The Gang of Four card game was first conceived during the upheaval of the Cultural Revolution. The game's inventor, Lee Yih, wanted to convey the mystery, intrigue and intense struggle for power that embodied not only China's recent political history - but also its past.&#10;Like the political Gang of Four, the game embodies a never-ending battle for supremacy - where the weak perish and the strong dominate. Good players, like good politicians, must show cunning, flexibility and ruthlessness.&#10;&#10;What's in the box?&#10;Gang of Four features a special 64-card deck, illustrated using a traditional Chinese theme, plus 2 rules summary cards to make learning and playing the game easier, a full-color rules booklet, scorepad and a Days of Wonder Web-Card, providing you with access to Gang of Four Online at www.gangoffour.com&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;All the cards are dealt to the players. The player who was dealt the multi-colored &quot;1&quot; card starts the hand and must use this card on the first play.  The players proceed taking turns clockwise and then counterclockwise on subsequent hands. On one's turn one must play the same number of cards but a higher ranked set than the previous player. A player may play  more cards if those cards are four or more of a kind. A round continues until all players pass because they can not or choose not to play cards. All cards played are discarded and the winner of the previous round leads. The hand continues until one player has used all the cards in his or her hand. The other players are penalized points on an escalating scale according to the number of cards in their hands. The game is over when one player has scored one hundred and the player with the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;Inspired by Big Two&#10;&#10;";1990;6.62122;1.8619

3099;Gettysburg;"One of the original set of Avalon Hill &quot;Adult Games&quot; that includes U-Boat, Tactics II, Verdict, and Dispatcher.&#10;&#10;This is one of the earliest &quot;typical&quot; wargames, with movement/strength counters, order of appearance chart, CRT, etc.&#10;&#10;Board has square grid with squares 1&quot; = 1/4 mile. One hour turns.&#10;&#10;27 Confederate counters&#10;41 Union counters&#10;&#10;Units include infantry, artillery, cavalry, HQs (but had no use), and outposts (pickets, not in '64 Ed.).&#10;&#10;Roberts redesigned this game in 1961 with hexagons.  Although it sold out, Roberts wasn't happy with it.  He then re-released it in 1964 with squares again, like the 1958 version.  However, the rules were significantly changed.&#10;&#10;The 1958 version was basically a miniatures game on a map.  You used range cards (shown in the illustration) both to move your units and then to check their firing range.  Units could rotate on their centers before checking with a range card, which was placed along the front side of the rectangular pieces.  You got better odds hitting from a flank.  Artillery had double range the of infantry or cavalry (this was only optional as far as I know). There were at least 3 slightly different rule books for the '58, '59, &amp; '60 Ed., all were basically the '58 one.&#10;&#10;The game also had optional rules for hidden movement.  You left the room while your opponent put his pieces on the board and moved them, recorded their new positions and removed them again!  If they came within sight of a unit (including an outpost unit), he had to tell you where they were seen, or leave them on the board if still in sight.  Line of sight rules for all this.&#10;&#10;The 1964 version required you to keep your units aligned with the square grid rather than the free form miniatures style movement of the 1958 version. This really didn't work well. Units facing diagonally had to be adjacent to form a solid wall of ZOC sqs. to their front and could not therefore protect their flanks if they spread out any at all. This made doubled and tripled attacks easily possible.&#10;&#10;Every version would benefit from a road movement bonus rule, x3 at a minimum (but x4 would be better, units that move this fast should not be able to attack that turn, though).&#10;&#10;";1958;5.7149;2.2292

This is done by drawing and laying tiles, where the edges of the tiles must match those they are laid adjacent to on the paddock boards.

Players must control 7 adjacent areas of Europe to win.&#10;&#10;Each player is given 5 armies (represented by 5 metal miniatures) which can be given secret values of 1-5 to represent strength.

Players state the values of their armies (a player can attack an opponent with more than one army), but in doing so can bluff this value. The defender can admit defeat and pay one 'power point' for every attacking army, or not believe the opposing declaration and cards are revealed. The loser now pays 2 'power points' per army. The strength cards are burned and new cards drawn by each player. For every 3 'power points' a player hold, they can control an area of Europe (by claiming it with 1 of their 7 metal towers).

3139;Goldland;"Each player has a backpack with room for 12 tools, provisions, trading goods, or treasures.  The number of squares you can move on a turn is the number of empty spaces in your backpack, so the lighter you travel, the faster.&#10;&#10;In the beginning, only 13 tiles (two legs of a 7x7 square) are on the table, and everybody starts in the corner with three fish (provisions) and two pearl necklaces (trading goods).  One thing to do on your turn is &quot;explore,&quot; adding a randomly drawn tile next to the one where your pawn currently stands.  The board gradually fills in to the point where the tile at the opposite corner from the start is drawn, and this tile is designated the site of the lost temple and pays bonuses for everyone who reaches it.  The sooner you get there, the better the bonuses.&#10;&#10;About half the squares are free to enter and let you obtain other items for your backpack.  If you're already carrying a fishing pole, for example, in some squares you'll be able to pick up more fish.  The other half are &quot;adventure&quot; tiles that require the expenditure of backpack items in order to gain entry.  You might have to spend two rifles, for example, to enter a wildcat tile; then you place a &quot;camp&quot; marker and can enter that tile for free in the future.  A lot of the game involves going back and forth to tiles where you can assemble the necessary items to work your way through the adventure tiles to the lost temple.&#10;&#10;Goldland appeals to puzzle-solvers and has a fun atmosphere of exploring the wilderness in search of El Dorado.&#10;&#10;";2002;6.61727;2.3841

Cards in hand can be used to attack and defend their colour buckets, taking out lower buckets causes cascades.&#10;&#10;The deck is five colours (farm animals) numbered 1-8, with two 1s and two 8s. Players start with 12 cards.  The start player plays 1-3 cards of one colour, giving a total sum. This total attacks the player to their left, who either plays 1-3 cards of the same colour totalling higher to defend, or loses a bucket. If they do defend though, that total then attacks the player to their left and so on, round the table. If it gets back to the start player, then can add 1-3 more cards to their original play, increasing the total. At some point, a player cannot defend, and buckets go tumbling. If you match the total attacking you this reverses the direction of play, meaning the cards already played are being added to additional cards to create high totals.&#10;&#10;Players look at their starting hand before building their pyramid o' buckets, so it pays to put your weak colours at the top.&#10;&#10;If you play a cards or cards, you draw back only one card from the draw deck. If you forget, tough! The game ends when a pre-set number of players lose all their buckets, the number increases with the number playing. The player with the most remaining is the winner.&#10;&#10;A game comes with enough buckets for 6 players, but you can play with multiple sets to allow larger groups to play. This works well as action down the far end of the table means you are safe, while the reversal mechanism means that there can be a build up of a lead to an unmatchable number before it breaks out of that end of the table.&#10;&#10;Seemingly a game of luck, but noticable that the same players keep winning and with experience the winning margins keep getting reduced.&#10;&#10;";2002;6.34324;1.2316
3145;Paroli;"A quick, Rummy style tile laying game. The tiles are numbered 1 to 10 in 3 colours with points values, green +10, blue +5, red -5 and Paroli cards worth -10.

3147;Mandarin;"Game Contents&#10;1 game board&#10;Tile dispenser and lid&#10;72 animal tiles&#10;1 die&#10;5 Mandarin figures&#10;5 tile collection cards&#10;Chinese play money&#10;Instructions&#10;Description of the Game Board&#10;The game board depicts the Chinese Zodiac, a cycle of 12 years in which each year is characterized by an animal or symbol. The Chinese, in common with many other Asian people, believe that every person will demonstrate in their lives those qualities of temperament of the special animal which controls the year of their birth.&#10;Players can discover what Animal Year they were born in by looking for their year of birth around each animal picture on the board. The Chinese Year, unlike the Western Year, runs from February to January, so remember this as you discover your animal sign. For example, a person born in January 1956 would be a goat, whereas a person born in February 1956 would be a Monkey.&#10;Operation of the Tile Dispenser&#10;Tiles are drawn one by one from the Dispenser by firmly pushing down on the lever on the side of the Dispenser. Occasionally, and especially when very few tiles are left in the Dispenser, no tile will be dealt on the first push of the lever. Simply push again, until a tile appears.&#10;Game set up&#10;Put all of the tiles in the Dispenser and place the lid on top. Gently shake the Dispenser and place it in the center of the board. Each player chooses a Mandarin and places it on the board on the center Chinese Character space of their own animal sign. If two or more players share the same sign, simply place the Mandarins side by side on the same space.&#10;Object of the Game&#10;Players collect tiles and place them in the appropriate places on their Collection Cards. The game ends when one player has collected at least one tile of each animal type, or all 6 tiles of one animal set. The first player to do this is the winner.&#10;&#10;";1991;6.3692;1.25

3155;Lumberjack;"Woodcutters compete in their annual Lumberjack game where they use real timber as components. In preparation for the game someone has spray-painted 100 logs in 5 different colors, and stacked them in a huge round tower with layers of 6 logs arranged randomly.&#10;&#10;A player takes a free log from the tower and uses it to build his own tower. Each player may only&#10;construct 3 towers and only the bottom log of each tower may touch the table. When a player feels he cannot extend a tower any further he can crown it with a white cap. This prevents any further building on that tower and ensures double scoring. (After scoring the topmost piece is removed.)&#10;&#10;When all logs from the central tower has been used, there is final scoring, and the woodcutter with the most points wins a brand-new chain saw.&#10;&#10;Also included are 3 variants:&#10;&#10;&quot;Easy Going&quot;: The players build up to 5 individual towers, but each of only a single color. The base may be formed from more than one log, but cannot be expanded after the next level has been started.  Scoring is for the highest tower in each color at the end of the game. Logs from collapsed towers are lost.&#10;&#10;&quot;Pyramido&quot;: Players build the pyramids with single color surfaces.&#10;&#10;&quot;Log Cabin&quot;: Build small houses using as few colors as possible.&#10;&#10;Above based on Brett &amp; Board which thanks Adam Spielt for use of the description.&#10;&#10;";2002;5.72575;1.4667
3157;All-Star Baseball;"Designed by former major league player Ethan Allen and introduced in 1941, All-Star Baseball became one of the most popular sports games of all time.  The game is essentially a batting simulation of major league baseball, built around a spinner and player disks that are divided into sections in such a manner that a hitter has the probabilty of reproducing his real-life statistics in such important categories as home runs, triples, doubles, singles, walks, and strikeouts. In general, the game follows the basic rules of major league baseball.  Teams are created from the player disks supplied with the game (often a mix of current players and all-time greats such as Babe Ruth) and from player disks for other seasons published separately.  The team at bats places the appropriate player disk on the spinner, spins, and reads off the resulting number.  The game does not attempt to realistically simulate pitching and defense.  Thus a hitter's result from a time at bat is not affected by the opposing pitcher or the defensive prowess of the fielder to whom the ball may be hit, although the player in the field on some play outcomes is required to spin a second spinner to determine the advancement of base runners and other certain details.  Results of each play are recorded on the field using plastic pegs for the base runners, while runs and outs are tallied on a rotating scoreboard.  Cumulative runs scored are tallied on paper score sheets. Strategy discs are included that enable plays like sacrifice flies, stealing bases, bunting, hit and run, etc. The team with the most runs after nine innings (or extra innings, if needed) is the winner.&#10;&#10;";1941;6.06194;1.3077

You can dump a card onto the discard pile if it has the same color, or number/symbol as the last. As well as the cards numbered 1-8, there are action cards that affect the next player. These may cause you to draw cards, reverse play, elect a colour and so on. But if you have a matching action card, you may play it immediately in reply as a discard, and your card then affects the next player.

What would happen if there were no _____?&quot;&#10;&#10;The player follows the instructions from the Instruction card and selects the appropriate color from the Category Card.  For instance, one Category Card has the word &quot;Sound&quot; in the GREEN Category.&#10;&#10;The player then gives as many responses to the question posed before the 30 second timer runs out.  For instance, the player may respond &quot;There would be no telephones, no car mufflers, no music, no communication, no radio, no volume controls...&quot;&#10;&#10;Players earn points based on the number of acceptable responses.  For instance, another player may disagree with &quot;no communication&quot; since it is quite possible to communicate without sound.&#10;&#10;The first player/team to 80 points wins.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.16667;2.0

3209;Pennant Race;"Pennant Race is a baseball game that concentrates not on individual games and the pitcher/batter confrontation but on roster management and trading over an entire season.  Real-life players are rated according to their batting average, power, speed and defense over the previous season and those ratings are used to simulate the outcome of a game on a single dice roll.

UFO cards are divided in colors and have numbers on them.&#10;The aim of the game is to play UFO cards from your hand in order to win the cards composing the circle. The cards you take score points.&#10;A card played from the hand can be played only on the UFO card in the circle next to the Planet card. Playing a card gives you the possibility of moving the Planet card accordingly to the value of the card played.&#10;UFO cards are played one at a time and the effect produced by each card is resolved before another card can be played (this gives you the possibility of building a strategy).&#10;A card from the circle can be taken only by cards of the same color.

3213;Pagoda;"A five-in-a-row game where each player has five pieces.    All the lines of five cross at the center piece, so it turns into a struggle for the control of the center of the board.  The pieces are 6-sided dice, and the up face determines how the piece can move.  When a piece is captured, it is rerolled and can enter play in its new form (i.e. it is reincarnated).  One of the pieces, the Buddah, is actually not played on the board, but instead fills a blank spot, acting as a wild card.&#10;&#10;";2001;6.0;2.3333
3215;Smart;"Based on information from the publisher's website:&#10;&#10;Smart is about buying, selling and using Smarts in Smartcity. 'Eating' the Smarts determines your emotional situation on the Emotionhead.&#10;&#10;In Smart players struggle to be the best Smartdealer and&#10;to become the owner of three new Smartshops. To do this, players buy, sell and use Smarts in the twelve neighborhoods (gameboard).&#10;&#10;In trading Smarts, you compare the popularity of different types of Smarts in the various neighborhoods, your distance from the neighborhoods in which there is demand for Smarts, the amount of various Smarts others want to  sell and the amount of Euro's others bid on new Smarts.&#10;&#10;Trade is connected to the four actions in every round.&#10;The Smarts you supply but don't sell are the Smarts you 'eat'. This 'eating' influences your emotional situation. How Relaxed, Dull, Hyper and Heavy you are, is indicated on the Emotionhead display. &#10;The corresponding actions can be used to improve your Smarttrade. So it's important to work on your emotional state.  Be careful of partial or even total epileptic attacks.&#10;&#10;Available tactics include good bidding, good selling and good 'eating'. Doing well in one of these gives opportunities to do well in the other two. But sometimes it is important to 'take it easy'. In many cases the winner at the end doesn't sell in every round and doesn't play a large role in every auction. The best advice: play Smart!&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;     A2-sized city board, painted by Annette Wiesman&#10;     real Smarts (actual candies, made of sugar, water soluble)&#10;     real half walnut shells &#10;     play Euros &#10;     Emotionhead board&#10;&#10;&#10;";1999;5.9;0.0

3219;Demonworld;"Demonworld is a hybrid miniatures and hex style wargame. The basic game comes with a 140 page rulebook, reference sheets, unit recruitment cards, 4 hex maps, and card stock counters representing a small orc and human (Empire) army.  The maps are generic terrain maps with light woods and small hills.  They may be combined in different ways to create different battlefields.  If you enjoy the game you can invest more money in it by purchasing the different 15mm regiment packs.  The game supports several races typical of the fantasy genre (elves, dwarves, orcs, dark elves) and adds a few unique ones as well (Thain[Norse], Isthak [chaos-like]).  The regiments generally consist of 8 to 10 counters.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:  Players are free to set their objectives for each battle, though some simple scenarios are provided to get you started.  Players spend points to add regiments for their armies.  Armies are set up on the edge of the mapboard and maneuvered to contact.  Orders are selected for each unit for each turn indicating whether it will skirmish (move and fire), attack (move to contact), move (move long distance), or hold (defend and fire at incoming attackers if missile equipped).  Use of ordered formations help a unit fight and move.  Combat bonuses are given to units who are able to hit their target in the flank or rear, use terrain to advantage, and use weapons that confer advantage in special cases (ie lance from a charging knight).  Morale rules determine whether a unit is going to hold their position, rout, or in some cases become 'impetuous' and aggressively continue an attack without orders to do so.&#10;&#10;As a player you assume the role of General of an army.   &#10;The game begins by recruiting an army. Each army is made up of several units. A unit is a group of soldiers who fight together in an organized fashion. Most units have 40 foot troops or 20 mounted models on ten individual hex bases. Sometimes a unit might be a single large creature like a dragon or war machine such as a catapult. Every unit has a points value and when you create an Army, both players will have an agreed upon amount of points to spend to create their army. This is most often 1200 points, the amount used for tournament play. For your army you may also want to recruit special heroes, commanders or wizards. Every unit in the Demonworld game has its own recruiting card which is included in the army book. These handy little cards make recruiting an army easy because they include all the information about a unit including its points cost.&#10;&#10;Once both players have spent all their points and created their army, it is time to create the battlefield. Demonworld is played on a large flat surface like a table. This could be a kitchen, dining room, or work table or even the floor. The Demonworld game is great because the battlefield consists of four or more of the Demonworld maps. You can also augment the maps with model trees, buildings or hills. This is not really necessary however, because the maps look great. Using the maps makes setting up a game really fast. Four of these maps are provided with the basic game. If you would like more variety several additional map sets are available.&#10;&#10;Once the maps are laid out each player will deploy their units on the battlefield. Where you place your units is crucial to the success of your army. Try to take advantage of the terrain. This could mean creating an ambush by hiding a unit in the woods. Or putting a unit on a hill where your opponent will have to fight uphill to attack them. If you can, also try to imagine what your opponent will do and then you may be able to set a trap for them or otherwise create a plan to defeat them.&#10;&#10;Once both armies are deployed (put on the table) play begins. Demonworld uses a simultaneous turn sequence. In each turn both players will have an opportunity to move all of their units and shoot missile weapons like bows, engage in hand to hand combat, or cast spells. The rules on how to perform these actions are in the Demonworld rule book. The army books have extra rules for special units which only that army may recruit and special spells which only that army can cast. As the turns progress each player will try to move their units to a position of advantage and eliminate the opponents units. Sometimes people play a game with a specific set of objectives. These games are called scenarios. In scenarios achieving your objectives is often more important than destroying your opponents army or preventing your own losses. Once one side has achieved its objectives or destroyed the opposing army, they are the winner and the game is over. Most games take about three hours. Experienced players play much faster than novices and can handle larger armies.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;";1999;6.84594;4.2

3229;The Game of Medici: Arms, Loves and Betrayals in XVth Century Europe;"Players represent the powers of the XVth century: Holy Roman Emperor, Ottoman Turk Sultan, Pope, King of Spain, King of France and the head of the famous Medici family of Florence. The board is hexagonal with each player having a path by which his pawns can visit his direct left and right neighbors. In addition, each side has a direct path to the center of the board. Players other than the direct neighbors could only be reached by traveling through the neighbors or the center.&#10;&#10;Included in the game are 6 domestic army pawns for each player, 36 mercenary pawns, 12 ambassador cards, 6 lady cards, 50 coins and 2 dice. At the beginning, each player receives the 6 domestic army pawns, 1 lady, 2 ambassadors and 3 coins.&#10;&#10;Combats are resolved without random chance by simple calculation of the difference between the number of pawns. &#10;Income is provided to the player on the basis of the number of spaces occupied by a single domestic pawn. Each player may offer alliance to any player and if accepted, ambassadors are exchanged. Alliance permits joint attacks and unlike some other games, alliances are law: allies absolutely cannot attack one another.&#10;&#10;";1982;6.7;2.3333
3231;Die Sieben Weisen;"In Die Sieben Weisen (which can translate as &quot;The Seven Magi&quot;), the players form shifting alliances to compete for Crystals, with the player who obtains the most crystals during the game being the winner.&#10;&#10;Each turn, the 7 roles in the game will be ranked in a hierarchy. Each player then chooses a role. When competing for the crystals later, each player may only play cards for his or her role (suit) or wild cards. Before that, however, players negotiate to form teams, which can involve secret or open negotiations, revealing cards, etc. Once formed, alliance members may freely swap cards amongst themselves.&#10;&#10;Players then play cards, with the alliance that plays the highest total value winning the crystals. However, the choicest crystals are given to this turns' highest-ranking player, not necessarily the player who played the most/strongest cards. Members of the losing alliance get to draw spell cards, which can affect the outcome of a round.&#10;&#10;At the end of the turn, new cards are drawn, and another round played.&#10;&#10;This game is #3 in the Alea small box series.&#10;&#10;";2002;6.01576;2.4

3263;Ukraine '43: The Soviet Summer Offensive Against Army Group South;"On August 3rd, 1943, less than two weeks after the Kursk offensive, the Soviets launched a massive offensive near Kharkov that ripped open the German line. The ensuing battle began their summer offensive that would take them across the Ukraine to the Dnieper River.&#10;During August the two sides were equally matched and a tremendous war of attrition raged from Kharkov to the Sea of Azov with neither side willing to give ground. In September, bled white by the never-ending Soviet attacks, the German army retreated in haste to the safety of the Dnieper River. In October, the battle raged along the length of the Dnieper and for the Perekop Peninsula, the only land exit to the German 17th Army in the Crimea. During this three month period German reinforcements poured in from every sector, but it was never enough. Three Soviet Tank Armies and four Soviet Fronts ground through nineteen panzer and panzergrenadier divisions. German and Soviet losses were staggering. Kiev, the capital of the Ukraine, fell on November 6th.&#10;&#10;&#10;[1st edition]&#10;&#10;Ukraine '43 attempts to simulate this important campaign in a moderately complex game. The design uses the conventional move-fight-exploit sequence of play and the popular Zone of Control Bond rules.

3265;NUTS! The Battle of the Bulge Card Game;"&quot;NUTS! The Battle of the Bulge&quot; is a card wargame for 2-4 players recreating the famous World War II battle in which the German Army mounted a surprise attack on the thin U.S. forces deployed in the Ardennes region, hoping to break through to the English Channel and split the Allied Forces.  Each player controls either the German or the U.S. and British forces.  Players draw cards in each daily turn from their own decks, then play the cards as they see fit.  Many cards can be played during the opponent's turn so there is constant interaction.  Each deck is complete; there are no cards to collect or trade.  NUTS! comes in two 150-card sets (North and South).  Each set is complete and can be played on its own, or the two sets can be played together.  (From the back of the box by Decision Games)&#10;&#10;The cards have actual photographs of units, events, cities, and equipment from the battle.  Cards comprise of units (infantry, artillery, mechanized), events like bad weather or supply drops, and terrain to include cities, major forest, rivers, and ridges.  Units are rated in strength values for infantry, armor, artillery, and cohesion.  The objectives are for the Germans to get three panzer units (six if playing both decks) from their start side off the Allied side of the board.  The Allies must prevent this and stall the offensive until adequate reinforcement arrival.  Although this is a card game, it plays very much like a board game.  Battles are resolved via dice rolling.  The rules do include important factors such as supply, town encirclement, weather, blitzes, cohesion checks, and the like.  Overall, an easy to medium game to grasp the rules and play.  (comments by Walt Mulder)&#10;&#10;";1998;6.03211;2.5385

3267;Pizarro & Co.;"Players are kings (or queens) bidding for the services of six famous explorers -- Ferdinand Magellan, Christopher Columbus, Francisco Pizarro, Vasco da Gama, James Cook, and Marco Polo. As the game progresses, competition for the explorers' services increases as each explorer has fewer expeditions available for investment. In the end, only one ship for each explorer makes the final trip and only one king earns those rewards.&#10;&#10;Firstly, the board is set up from two double-sided boards, giving four possible configurations with slightly different versions of each explorer. Each player has six ships and money cards numbered 1 to 9. There are three turns. In the first, each explorer has 3 ships, but only two of these will proceed to the second turn and only one will win through to the third.&#10;&#10;A set of cards with explorers is used for each turn - 3 of each explorer in turn one, 2 of each in turn two and 1 of each in the last turn. The top card is revealed and an auction held, going round the table until all but one player has passed. The winning bidder puts the card in front of them and places one of their ships on to the relevant explorer area on the board. This process is repeated until all the cards have been bid on.&#10;&#10;Each explorer has a different power, some giving victory points, others money or a special ability like being able to delay a subsequent auction, or a combination of these. At the end of a turn players gain two new money cards, plus any which explorers they have a ship on give them. The second turn work in the same way, but only players with a ship invested in an explorer can bid on it, and because there are only two ships of the three on each explorer moving to the second area, one will be left behind. Similarly, the third round sees just one ship of the remaining two move to the third and final area for each explorer. Scoring is then done, with more points available for players with ships reaching the third area.&#10;&#10;Money is always tight so it is a good idea to try and get some extra income, though this conflicts with the need to score points. Two of the explorers score a lot of points but have no income so each player must balance the two needs. Money cards are worth points as well, so there is also a trade off between using these to win auctions to advance your ships and keeping them to score with.&#10;&#10;";2002;6.50908;2.446
3268;Bunker Poker;"Very simple luck driven game.  Each player has 6 dice all showing the 6.  You hide your 'king' under one of the dice.  Then you roll two other dice and rotate an enemy die down the number of pips or rotate one of your dice up the number of pips.  You are trying to get a die down to nothing so you can look under it to see if you have captured a king.&#10;&#10;";1999;4.85814;1.0

3270;Lamarckian Poker;"In Lamarckian Poker players start with a hand resembling primordial ooze, but attempt through successive generations to &quot;evolve&quot; it into something more useful. But unlike Lamarck's giraffes, they may find themselves competing with others for the very same improvements. In the end, the player who has accumulated the best Poker hand wins.&#10;&#10;Can be played using a standard Poker deck without Jokers.&#10;&#10;Players start with four cards. Each round, there are four new cards available. Each player simultaneously chooses a card from her hand. The cards are revealed and then resolved in order from highest to smallest, with suit order breaking ties. Each card takes all the cards of same value OR same suit from the pool and then goes into the pool, so a card played never returns to the hand of the player and later cards can capture earlier cards. The cards that are left in the pool are discarded and a new pool of four cards is dealt.&#10;&#10;This process is repeated as long as there are cards left in the deck, then the player who has the best five-card Poker hand wins the game.&#10;&#10;";1999;6.43862;1.6111

3273;Cat Attack;"Cat Attack, suitable for two to six players, aged 8 years and over and made entirely in the EU. The game has been designed with the fun strategy player in mind. Playing time 40 - 180+ mins depending on the number of players.&#10;&#10;The game Cat Attack is based on the trials and tribulations of the domestic cat. The board represents a local neighborhood. Each player is a (model) cat that lives in its own house. To win the game a cat must fill its larder with six items of food. There is milk at the Dairy, vitamins at the Vet, fish from the Fishmonger and a tin of cat food from the corner shop. There are also (model) birds and mice, which the cats have to catch. Of course, each cat begins the game with nine lives; any cat that loses all of its nine lives is out of the game. Players are dealt a hand of Mog cards; these and a die provide the means to move the cats, birds and mice. The players can choose to move their cats along garden walls or paths or, the more adventurous can travel round the road, this route is a lot quicker but there is a car. Cats can raid other cats larders and attack one another. A pack of Curiosity cards dictate, at random, when the shops open and close and movements of the (model) car. A Curiosity card is picked up when a cat lands on a Curiosity square. Some of these cards are good news but you know what happened to the curious cat!&#10;&#10;";2002;5.50095;1.6923

3277;Save Our Bureaucrats;"This is a representative of this peculiarly American class of board game produced for political reasons, as a form of parody.  For some reason, most instances of these games come from the right wing (another game in the same class is Capital Punishment, which is much more vitriolic in its political commentary).&#10;&#10;The &quot;object&quot; of this game is to &quot;go broke and go on Welfare with the help of government grants and boondoggles&quot;.  As the player tokens go around the board, their starting money eventually dwindles to nothing, at which point they no longer receive nor pay out money (ignoring the instructions on most of the board spaces) and exclusively draw from the Welfare fund (a separate pile of money) each turn they go around the board.  The game continues until the Welfare is exhausted, and the winner is then the player who got the most Welfare.&#10;&#10;";1980;4.33333;0.0

Or the player may use his two &quot;liberals&quot; to spring the opposing players' criminals from the &quot;Path of Justice&quot; back to the Street often enough to turn all fifteen of each opponent's Innocent Citizens into Victims of violent crimes.

3279;Magi-Nation Duel;"Collectible Card Game in which players are &quot;Magi&quot; using their powers to summon creatures to battle for them.  Similar to Magic: The Gathering in many ways, except there are no &quot;lands&quot; or similar methods of generating magical power.  Instead, players siphon power from their Magi or their monsters to perform attacks or put cards into play, thus controlling just how many powerful cards a player can attempt to unleash in a single turn. (in essence, you must sacrifice your own creatures to fuel more powerful attacks and techniques).  The game was meant to target an audience of those that felt Pokemon was too much a kids game, but not ready to jump into the highly competitive (and 'older' target audience) of Magic: The Gathering.  The concept also spawned a not-so-successful cartoon series and Game Boy Color video game.  Starter decks include all the required counters, a six-sided die, quick reference player aids, and a play mat.&#10;&#10;";2000;7.05478;2.7273

Players choose a major character that is accompanied by one or two minor characters. Each set of characters has its own deck of cards which are used for attack, defense, or special abilities. Each deck is unique with certain special powers relevant to the major character. There are different modes of play; one-on-one battles, up to three teams can play against each other, or up to six players can play a free-for-all battle.&#10;&#10;Battle fields included are Geonosis Arena, Emperor's Throne Room, Carbon-Freezing Chamber, and Kamino Platform.

Players receive a number of Jedi cards from a random draw.  The Jedi are distributed around the circular battle field as are the enemy.  Players then move one of their Jedi and attack the enemy, followed by moving one of the enemy and attacking an opposing player's Jedi.  The advanced game includes the Reek which players may try to climb upon and/or crush their opponents with. There is a built in mechanism that will end the game through use of Yoda moving along a track when a &quot;Yoda&quot; die face comes up.  When he reaches the end of the track, it's game over (unless everything has been destroyed before then). Players win by destroying the most creatures, counting only those on their surviving Jedi cards.  There is also a nice mechanism to allow an eliminated player back into the game using unclaimed Jedi cards.&#10;&#10;The game comes with a sturdy mounted board, 18 Jedi cards, 3 special dice with attack labels, 74 hard cardboard Pawns with plastic stands, and rules.&#10;&#10;FROM THE BOX: The Jedi have been thrown into a perilous fight against a swarm of enemy creatures.

The face of the earth is changed and numerous areas around the globe are contaminated and destroyed.  Now mankind must fight against aliens, mutants, delinquents, looters, criminals, disease, radiation, and all the other ills the war has brought.

There are chips which can be placed on the board at the start of the game to block certain spaces, creating different board configurations. Alternatively, all the spaces can be covered with chips, and the goal of the game then becomes to capture the most chips by moving onto them.

3300;Die Druiden;"Moon &amp; Sun Druids select a new leader by moving around the circles of stones. A mix of cards and dice and symbols.&#10;&#10;The Druids start from the Grove, in the centre of the Stone Circle. When a player begins his turn, he must move his druid, firstly, onto one of the 6 stones showing a Pentagram. This is the only space that may be moved to, from the centre area. The player throws both dice. At the beginning of the game each player has only one piece available (his Druid), therefore only one of the dice is used to determine movement. The second dice is unused until such time as the player has other game-pieces available for him to move. The meaning of the symbols on the dice dictate the type of movement allowed.&#10;The space on which a Druid lands also affects further events. After the player has carried out all necessary actions then his turn is over. If a Druid lands on a blank stone then his turn is immediately ended and play passes to the next player.&#10; Once a player has taken control of two or more pieces then he may apply the dice to their full potential. In this case a player can, for example, move two Spirits or one Spirit and one Druid. Naturally he will choose the optimum moves, considering the symbols on the stones and the location of other game pieces, which each piece can land on.&#10;The player with the most points, overall, wins the game and is proclaimed the new High-Druid.&#10;&#10;";1995;5.16786;2.0

The board strips are shuffled and dealt out 6 to each player. The first player lays one of their board strips and places one of their game pieces on one of the squares. Game pieces MUST be played on squares of the same color of the game piece. The next player may then either place one of their game pieces on the same board or lay down another board next to the first one long sides touching and places one of their game pieces on the board strip just played.

3307;Wallenstein;"Historically, Albrecht von Wallenstein, duke of Friedland and Mecklenburg, was one of the most important mercenary commanders of the Imperial army during the Thirty Years' War (1618-48). His overweening ambition was to head a large central European empire, which got him dismissed in 1630. Such was his power, however, that the empire was forced to reinstate him when Sweden came into the fray. He recovered Bohemia, but was defeated by Gustavus Adolphus at L&uuml;tzen, and was again dismissed. His subsequent intrigues with Protestant forces alarmed the Catholic princes who were probably complicit in his assassination in 1634 by Irish mercenaries at Eger, Bohemia.&#10;&#10;The game begins with the start of the war, each player controlling several countries. Player actions include the conquest of new countries, tax collection, erection of buildings (i.e. development of the economy), feeding the populace, victualing the army, etc. Some actions increase the chance for unrest, and expensive rebellions can occur.

3312;1776: The Game of the American Revolutionary War;"1776 is a two-player, turn-based war game played on a hex grid map of the thirteen colonies and Canada.  It is primarily concerned with the military aspects of the American Revolutionary War. There is a basic game, various scenarios with advanced rules and a campaign game.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill Complexity Rating - 7&#10;&#10;&#10;(from the back of the box:)&#10;&#10;The shot heard round the world at Lexington set off more than just another brushfire war in England's scattered dominions. It gave birth to a struggling new nation led by a comparative handful of patriots whose refusal to bow before tyranny set the tone for an American heritage preserved from defeat to this very day. But victory did not come cheap. &#10;After showing the British the color of their mettle at Bunker Hill, Washington's little army was plagued by one defeat after another, shunting from one battlefield to the next; always beaten but never destroyed. No power of the period believed that the upstart colonials and their unborn nation had the slightest chance of emerging victorious against the strongest military machine of the era after the dismal summer of 1776. But then came the cruelest winter of the decade when even nature seemed to join forces with the British against the tattered American troops. Undaunted, Washington led his small force in the historic crossing of the Delaware to twice surprise and rout British forces at Trenton and Princeton. Their resolve thus strengthened, the ill-clad Americans retired to Valley Forge to face winter beset by the hunger and deprivation that cost the lives of 2500 patriots.

It is a realistic simulation of the strategic situation faced by British and American alike in that fiery decade when the United States won its independence. &#10;Actually, 1776 is six games in one: a Basic Game that gets you quickly and easily into the routine of simulation gaming; an Advanced Game with scenarios that provides additional complexity and realism; and a Campaign Simulation Game that encompasses the entire war and balances successes in one region against failures in another - truly the ultimate in a simulation gaming experience! &#10;And if you don't have the time for a complete Campaign Game, there are four scenarios to choose from; each of which poses a challenge for everyone; from the most erudite of military historians to the fellow who just managed to pass American History:&#10;&#10;Scenario 1: The Invasion of Canada - 1775 to 1776 - Can YOU do better than the bumbling General Schuyler and Benedict Arnold in the vain American atttempt to make Canada a 14th colony?&#10;&#10;Scenario 2: The Saratoga Campaign - 1777 - Can YOU as General Horatio Gates surround and destroy the forces of the British General Burgoyne in this reinactment of the turning point of the Revolution?&#10;&#10;Scenario 3: Greene's Southern Campaignv - 1780 to 1781 - Can YOU as General Nathaniel Greene lead Cornwallis' tested regulars on a merry chase with your force of rag-tag militia and Guerilla bands without being crushed in a major engagement?&#10;&#10;Scenario 4: The Yorktown Campaign - 1781 - Can you duplicate Washington's encirclement and crushing defeat of Cornwallis in the battle that won the Revolution?&#10;&#10;Contents: &#10;&#10;     a 16&quot; x 44&quot; four-section, full color mapboard depicting colonial America from Quebec to Georgia; &#10;     two sets of die-cut troop counters representing over 400 units of Continentals, British Regulars, Rebel and Tory Militia, French Regulars, Indians, and naval units of the British and French fleets; &#10;     1 die; &#10;     1 Terrain Effects Chart; &#10;     2 sets (8 per set) of Tactical Combat Cards used in the innovative, new Sustained Combat system; 1 set of scenario, CRT, and play chart cards organized on an index-card format that puts a summary of all levels of the game at your fingertips; &#10;     a 32-page Rules &amp; Designers' Notes Manual telling you how to play all 6 game versions plus the inside story on research and development and why the game was designed the way it was.&#10;&#10;&#10;Rated &quot;Tournament Level&quot; on Avalon Hill's Simulation-complexity scale.&#10;&#10;";1974;6.53331;3.0987
3313;Traverse;"Traverse is played on a square &quot;checker&quot; game board with a 12 1/2&quot; x 12 1/2&quot; grid. Each player chooses one color of playing pieces. Each player has eight pieces of the same color: 2 squares, 2 diamonds, 2 triangles, and 2 circles. Each player arranges their pieces in ANY ORDER within their starting row. The object of the game is to get ALL of your pieces into the starting row of the player sitting opposite of you. The pieces move in different directions depending upon the shape:&#10;&#10;    Squares can move horizontally and vertically. &#10;    Diamonds can move only diagonally. &#10;    Triangles can move forward on the diagonals or straight backwards. &#10;    Circles can move in any direction. &#10;&#10;&#10;Players take turns moving one piece each turn. Two pieces can not occupy the same space. Pieces can move in single space moves, one space at a time and only into an empty adjacent space as dictated by the piece's legal moves. Players can jump over their own or another player's piece. Jumped pieces are NOT captured, akin to Chinese Checkers. Players can string together a series of jumps if each individual jump in the series conforms to the rules governing single jumps. The first player to move all of their pieces into the destination row is the winner. Players can not force a draw.&#10;&#10;Listed on &quot;GAMES 100&quot; GAMES Magazine&#10;1992 Mensa Select&#10;&#10;2-4 players ages 7 to adult&#10;&#10;";1987;5.99966;1.9688

You must clear your hand of 10 cards, by placing successive cards face down on the deck, bluffing as necessary. So the deck is started by a player laying 1s, the next player lays 2s, one by one and so on. At some point, your bluff is called. If you were false, draw more cards. If you were true, your opponent draws. There are action cards, including a sack of lies which has no value and so you must lie when playing it.&#10;&#10;Playing Scheinheilig your goal is to get rid of the cards in your hand.&#10;In total, there are 70 cards numbered evenly from 1 to 10, 26 Angels (Jokers), 8 Devils (don&acute;t want those) and 8 &quot;skip a turn&quot;-cards. Every player starts the game with 10 cards and play proceeds clockwise.&#10;The youngest player starts and has to discard cards with the number &quot;1&quot; face down. At least he has to pretend to discarded 1&acute;s. A player can put down any number of cards. The next player can then either accept whatever was just discarded and discard 2&acute;s on his own or he can question one of the cards just discarded and turn it face up. If he was right and card does not show the correct number, the player who tried to discard a wrong card has to take back the questioned card and all cards on top of it. On top of that he has to roll the die and draw that many cards from the deck. If the questioned card had the correct number, the questioning player has to roll the die and draw that many cards. Angels are always considered the correct number, Devils never. Whenever it is your turn, you can also just draw a card and end your turn.

3321;Die Pyramiden des Jaguar;"Players build a pyramid using 40 numbered cards, taking care to construct the pyramid with the lowest value card at the bottom left, and the highest at the top. This is done by each player, in turn, offering two cards from their hand. The opposing player takes one of the two for his/her pyramid, leaving the other for the first player to put on their pyramid. Cards already on a pyramid can be covered once (after that they are covered by a jaguar stone), an action that triggers movement along the jungle path (scoring track). Certain steps on the path also contain events that can alter construction of the pyramids. The person who completes their pyramid first gets extra steps along the path. The round ends when a player has completed his pyramid, has only one or zero cards left in hand or when either player cannot legally play a card.

3339;Diceland: Deep White Sea;"James Ernest once again stakes out some uncharted game design territory with Diceland: Deep White Sea.  The game consists of five sets of octahedral stiff paper dice, about 2&quot; per edge, with five team members per set.  These dice have full-color comic-book style artwork by Eduardo Muller and game information printed on each face, and each die represents a character. Each die is pre-cut and scored, and assembles easily with just tabs and slots.  Despite being made from &quot;mere paper,&quot; the dice are surprisingly sturdy, and the use of a good quality card stock means they tend to stay in good condition. Unless you accidentally sit on one, of course.&#10;&#10;The basic goal is to be the first person to reach 50 points, which are earned by &quot;killing&quot; your opponent's characters.  Each turn, you may throw a new character into the arena (if you have any available to throw), have one of your characters use his or her action or power, or have one of your characters move.  Movement is done by rotating a die onto a new face on the table.  If you throw a new character into play, he or she may immediately use his or her power on the side that lands face up. Available powers may be an attack or a special action. Some of the special actions allow you to, in turn, use the powers of other teammates, triggering a cascading reaction across the table.&#10;&#10;Attacking is simple: Each attack has a power rating.  If it exceeds the block rating of the defending dice, the defending dice is killed, and the attacker scores its points (printed on side one of each die).  If it is equal or less than the defense value, the defending die is merely moved so that a lower value face is face-up, unless it's been &quot;wounded&quot; so many times that it's already on its lowest face, in which case, it dies.&#10;&#10;A basic game of Diceland lasts about 20 minutes.&#10;&#10;List of Diceland sets and armies&#10;&#10;";2002;6.43105;1.92
3340;Hard Vacuum;"Hard Vacuum is a sci-fi space combat game based in a fictional World War II. The players take on the roles of pilots from either the U.S. Space Corps or the German Raummacht in about a dozen well balanced scenarios spanning from around 1942 to 1945. The game requires you to supply the playing surface (the rules are designed for either a hex field or a completely free form field) and the dice (which ideally should read 0-5 instead of 1-6). The counters are supplied on a laminated piece of paper roughly the same quality as the cover of the book, you must cut them out.&#10;&#10;Each turn begins with each player secretly marking down how much thrust they are applying to which thrusters on their ships. These are simultaneously revealed, and thrust markers are added/removed as needed. Because space is a vacuum, thrust applied in one direction will mean you go in that direction until you compensate for it!&#10;&#10;The next part of the turn is the combat phase. Players must roll the dice to determine if they can still see their opponent. If they can see their enemy can they shoot. All the players fire their weapons simultaneously, and then they apply the results of hits and criticals at the same time. The turn is now complete.&#10;&#10;There are significant technological differences between the American and German spacecraft. The German craft are generally more powerful, but have a limited supply of fuel and weapons, while the American craft are weaker, but their fuel and weapons supply automatically recharges each turn.&#10;&#10;Hard Vacuum is aimed at any fan of classic sci-fi, dogfight, or space combat games. It has a lighter, almost comic book quality in its setting and the game does not get bogged down by complex rules or mechanics. Once the game mechanics are mastered (which does not take long), a complete game can be played in under an hour.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;     Hard Vacuum: Science Gone Mad&#10;     Hard Vacuum: War's End&#10;&#10;&#10;";2000;7.37143;2.625

The special action cards allow players to:&#10;&#10;* Miss a turn - next player misses their turn&#10;&#10;  * Change direction - the order of play is reversed&#10; * Take 2 - next player draws two cards&#10;&#10;* Choose a colour - can be named as any colour, changing the colour in play&#10;&#10;* Take 4 + choose a colour - you choose a colour, next player picks up four&#10;&#10;* Swap cards - choose another player and swap cards with them&#10;&#10;* Change all cards - all hands move round one space in play direction&#10;&#10;The Miss a Turn, Change direction, Take 2 and Swap cards are colour coded and must be played following a card of the same colour, the Choose a colour, Take 4 + choose a colour and Change all cards actions are colour independent.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    UNO&#10;&#10;&#10;";1993;5.29066;1.0429
3348;Santa Fe Rails;"On a map showing the western portion of the United States, each player takes turns building track to extend any of five major railroad lines westward from their originating cities.  Players often want the lines to extend in different directions toward the cities that they have a stake in. Some branching is allowed, but each line has a limited number of track pieces.&#10; Stakes for specific cities are accumulated throughout the game by drawing blind from a deck of city cards.  The more different lines arriving at a city, the higher the score will be for that city.  Later in the game, four short lines also become available.&#10;&#10;An updated version of Alan R. Moon's White Wind game Santa Fe.&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;The deck is composed of city cards (with some short lines shuffled into the middle third). Players have a hand of 4 city cards to start the game. Each round, players simultaneously select a card to play, then reveal. City cards are added to your personal display -- essentially, you have a share in that city. There are also several special cards (2x, 3x, 4-in-one, Branch Line, Boomtown) that modify the basic game turn. These specials are on public display, and can be acquired at the end of each round (some cost $1; the 2x may be held, but the rest must be played immediately after acquiring them).&#10;&#10;Then, in turn order, going twice around, players add a single track to any of the railheads (each of the 5 lines has specific starting locations on the board). If the link is to a previously unconnected city, collect $2. In addition, if the city is one of the goal cities of that train line, collect $4.&#10;&#10;After all players have gone (twice), pass the start player marker to the left. THEN, in turn order, players bring their hand total back to 4 (draw from deck and/or from cards on display). If a Short Line card is revealed, discard the card and draw again; that Short Line is now in play. They choose a card to play, and repeat above.&#10;&#10;The game ends when tracks for 3 lines are completely used. Each city's value is equal to its base value, printed on board, multiplied by the number of different train lines connected to it. The player with the most cash and city value wins!&#10;&#10;";2001;6.79856;2.51
3349;Die Safeknacker;"In this card driven game, safe-crackers co-operate but must share the spoils.  The player who finishes the game with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;Everyone has two choices in their turn: either recruit safe-crackers or attempt to crack a safe. One of these two must be chosen every turn.&#10;&#10;The first choice is to take one of your own safe-crackers and put him on any of another player. Put this safe-cracker in that team before you. This way you can build safe-cracker teams in addition to individual safe-crackers. The piece lying on top shows who has the safe-cracking team under their control.&#10;&#10;The second choice is to crack the safe. First a gaze at the safe cards: On each safe card, a value that this safe contains is printed - the loot. Simultaneously it also portrays how large the safe-cracking team must be in order to crack this safe; the team may also be bigger. Place the team on the desired safe, dismantle it and share the loot.&#10;The card with the cracked safe is set aside and a new safe card is uncovered.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all the safes are cracked. The player with the most money wins the game.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Buccaneer&#10;&#10;&#10;";1996;5.82262;1.5

3351;Wer ist der TÃ¤ter?;"Wanted. There are 48 suspects for the murder, can you reveal the killer?&#10;&#10;The game has 48 cards showing combinations of old/young/man/women, in 4 colors, with different murder weapons. One player shuffles the cards and takes the top card without revealing it to the other players. This is the perpetrator. Now he takes the next card and places it face-up on the table. He compares it to the perpetrator-card.&#10;If one the features (old/young/man/woman/poison/dagger/gun/blue/green/yellow/brown) matches the perpetrator-card he says that the person on that card is suspicious. If none of the features match he says that the person on the card is innocent.&#10;This continues until a player thinks he knows who is the perpetrator. If the accuser is wrong, he may not guess again until another player succesfully accuses the right perpetrator. This player scores 1 point.&#10;Now the next player shuffles the cards and picks a perpetrator and a new round starts. If all players started a new round, the game ends and the player with most points wins. In case of a tie, one additional round is played with the tied players.&#10;&#10;Players take turn calling and the winner is the best detective.&#10;&#10;";1989;5.67073;1.2
3352;Gouda! Gouda! Cat Attack;"You lead a gang of 5 mice in a race for cheese. To move your mice, you throw special dice with green, red, and yellow faces. A green face lets you move a mouse forward; a red face makes you move backward, and a yellow face does nothing. You even have special powers to help you out. Get one of your mice to the cheese first, and it's yours. Simple, right? Not quite! Your opponents are not sitting still - they can move their mice (and yours!) and use their special powers to slow you down.&#10;&#10;A winner of the 2001 Concours International de Cr&#195;&#169;ateurs de Jeux de Soci&#195;&#169;t&#195;&#169;.&#10;&#10;";2002;5.22996;1.1786
3353;WW2: Barbarossa to Berlin;"(from GMT Games:)&#10;&#10;Spring 1941: Nazi Germany is triumphant. Poland has long since vanished from the map. Denmark, Norway, and the Low Countries have been overrun. France, the victor of 1918, has fallen. Greece and Yugoslavia have now been crushed. Britain stands alone, freed from the threat of invasion by the courage and skill of its air force and navy. But Britain is stalked and assaulted by the Nazi wolfpacks, and in North Africa a mixed garrison of British and Commonwealth forces is besieged in Tobruk by Rommel and his Afrika Korps.&#10;&#10;Then, on June 22, Hitler launches Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of Stalin's Soviet Union. As the panzer spearheads slice through the bewildered Russian defenders, it appears that nothing can halt the Nazi tide. But the course of History has just taken a major turn. The Last European War is over; World War II has begun. It will end four years later, in a bunker in the ruins of Berlin.&#10;&#10;World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin covers those four years of epic struggle, from Moscow to Stalingrad, from Tobruk to Tunis, from Sicily to Rome, from D-Day to the Rhine, to the final battles for the Reich. Designed by Ted Raicer as a follow-up to his award-winning WWI strategic game, Paths of Glory, World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin modifies the Paths of Glory systems to capture the strategic and operational dynamics of WWII in Europe.&#10;&#10;As in Paths of Glory, World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin uses a point to point map, this time covering all of Europe from France to the Urals, and from Norway to North Africa. Units are armies and corps (fronts and armies for the Soviets), and each turn represents three months. The movement and combat systems will be familiar to Paths of Glory players, but have been modified to recreate the blitzkrieg campaigns of 1941-45.&#10;&#10;As in Paths of Glory, the heart of the game lies in the 110 Action Cards (55 each for the Axis and Allied players). Each card can be used for operational movement and combat, strategic movement, replacements, or for an Event. Events include:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Individual leaders (Patton, Guderian, or Rommel the Desert Fox) &#10;    Tactical innovations and new weapons (Fortified boxes, Tiger tanks) &#10;    Strategic Warfare (U-boats, Bomber Command, the 8th Airforce) &#10;    Reinforcements (Soviet Mechanized Fronts, PanzerArmee Afrika, Patton's Third Army) &#10;    Allied Invasions, actual or potential (Torch, Sledgehammer, Husky, Overlord) &#10;    Politics and Diplomacy (Hitler Declares War, Casablanca, Yalta, Operation Axis) &#10;    Irregular Warfare (Partisans, the Maquis, Otto Skorzeny)&#10;&#10;&#10;World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin presents both the Allied and Axis players with a wide range of exciting game choices, while illustrating the key historical factors of the war; from the importance of mechanized forces in combat to the importance of oil to fuel them, but without the complexity of other strategic WWII designs. And unlike many of those games, World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin lives up to its title: an Axis player who fails to win the war may still win the game. The winner is often decided on the last turn as the Allied player struggles to extinguish the last traces of the Nazi empire.&#10;&#10;It is June 22, 1941: Will WWII end in German triumph in Barbarossa or collapse in Berlin? As the world holds its breath, the decisions are yours.&#10;&#10;";2002;7.28718;3.5294
3354;Tide of Fortune;"This is an evolution of the Westwar series first introduced by Vanguard Games with Pas de Calais. Other games using a similar system are To the Far Shore and the Italian Campaign series (Sicily, Salerno, Anzio and Med War).&#10;&#10;Tide of Fortune features the September-October Allied campaign in northern Belgium and in the Low countries, culminating with the Arnhem operation.&#10;&#10;Scale is 1-2 days/turn (variable because of the Impulse system), 3 km/hex. Units are regiments/brigades.&#10;&#10;The game has 2 22&quot;x34&quot; maps, 300 counters.&#10;&#10;The heart of the system is the Operations phase where players alternate activating formations (divisions) which execute Orders (Assault, Advance, Maneuver etc.).&#10;&#10;Players bid for Initiative and there are possibilities for the Reaction player to foil the initiative player's moves by having units react and do spoiling attacks.&#10;&#10;Losses can be applied to the HQ of a formation, not only directly to units.&#10;&#10;Low counter density, high maneuver. Medium-high complexity.&#10;&#10;";1993;6.14583;3.1429
3355;Junk Yard;"Throw a set of dominoes, a deck of cards, and a game board into a trash bag.  Shake it up really well then dump it onto the table.  Since you will still only have a jumbled set of dominoes, cards and a board, you should try the Junk Yard of games contained in this bag instead.  We have taken come of the best features of cards games like taking tricks, passing cards you don't like to another player and trumping your opponent's clever play.  We've added the great things about dominoes like standing them up in front of you instead of having to hold a deck of cards, stacking them up, knocking them down, and the solid thunk one makes when you play it on the table with authority.  Add a board (well, actually a bag with a board printed on it) to play these games on and make your tiles look better than most other trash and you have Junk Yard and other Trick-Taking Tile-Laying Board Games.&#10;&#10;";2002;5.92188;2.5

3358;Affenraffen;"Players frantically search for pairs among the face down tiles on the table. Both color (gold, green or blue) and animal (ape, zebra, lion, penguin or flamingo) must match to qualify as a pair. The object is to fulfill the conditions on one of four goal tiles, e.g. any three animal pairs with different colors. Players are allowed to use only one hand and can't peek at the pairs they've collected, so not only do they have remember where tiles are on the table, but exactly which pairs they need to finish the goal.&#10;&#10;Is a re-release of Zock! with different rules.&#10;&#10;";2002;5.99451;1.1429
3359;Anagrams;"Anagrams is a game where players reveal letter tiles one at a time, claiming any word as soon as they can make it. Once a word is in front of someone, other players may steal it by making an anagram of it which introduces other letters from the pool.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented as Snatch and Scrabble Scoring Anagrams. Published during the same time frame as the 1877 Word Making and Taking. A version of this game using the word &ldquo;anagram&rdquo; in its title was published by Thomas Whittaker in New York on or before 1875 and was called &ldquo;The Game of Anagrams&rdquo;. With Parker Brothers and McLoughlin Brothers both releasing Anagrams games in 1890, this likely reflects the expiry of the 17 year patent period that existed at the time.&#10;&#10;&#10;Many editions of the game have been sold and exact rules vary, but one version runs as follows:&#10;&#10;The players shuffle the letters in the &quot;pool&quot; thoroughly. Each player, in turn, draws a letter tile from the pool and places it face up on the table. These letters are available to all players on their turn.&#10;&#10;Before starting play it should be decided that either 3-letter, 4-letter or 5-letter words are to be established as the basis of play.&#10;&#10;Then the first player draws a letter from the pool. Keeping it hidden, he tries to form one word of 2 or more letters with the letter in his hand and with at least one or more of those letters face up on the table. He may also form the word with only the face up letters and not use the letter in his hand. Whenever a player forms a word, his turn ends.&#10;&#10;If a player cannot form a word, or if he forms one but doesn't use the letter he has drawn from the pool, he must discard this letter at the end of his turn. The letter is discarded by putting it face up with the other turned up letters on the table. Then the next player moves.&#10;&#10;When a player forms a word, he places it in front of him facing it to the center of the table. This is done so the other players can easily see it. It gives them the chance to steal words. As the game continues and players gather words, they may steal the words from one another. This is done by taking all the letters of another player's word and adding one or more letters to it to completely change that word's meaning. The letters added to a word in &quot;stealing&quot; may be the one drawn by the player from the pool or one or more of those face up.&#10;&#10;Adding S to make a word plural (or ED or ING) does not change the meaning of a word and cannot be used to &quot;steal&quot; a word. Any letters at all, however, can be used in &quot;stealing&quot; a word if the new word formed is entirely changed in meaning.&#10;&#10;Players should make their own words harder to steal by adding letters to them and making them more complex. This counts as a complete turn and is as important as forming new words.&#10;&#10;When all of the tiles have been drawn from the pool, players, continue in turn to try to form words using the face up letters. The game ends when there are no more face up letters, or when no player is able to move using the remaining face up letters. Each player counts the number of tiles in all of the words he has formed in front of him.&#10;&#10;The winner is the person who has first obtained eight (8) words. The game is not over until ALL players have had an EQUAL number of turns.&#10;&#10;If at the end of an equal number of turns there is more than one player with eight (8) words, count the number of tiles in those 8 words. The player with the most tiles wins. If the number of tiles in the 8 words is equal, then the game ends in a tie.&#10;&#10;";1875;6.75507;2.0

Cards left in players' hands at the end of play in each deal are counted against them and the low score wins the game. As soon as one player reaches 100 points, the game ends and the player with the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;The player at the left of the dealer starts by placing any word of not less than two or more than four letters in the center of the table, naming the words as they play it. After the first player, all following must play to the words already formed on the table. If the first player (or any subsequent player) cannot form a complete word, they discard one card from their hand and take in exchange either the exposed card, or the top Blind card, from one of the piles on the table. Before taking from the Blind pile, the player must always discard first.&quot;&#10;&#10;There are several game variations in the rule book, Crossword Lexicon, Lexicon, Lexicon Solitaire and several different options for these card games that can be played with this deck.&#10;&#10;Also, at the bottom of one of the pages is, ...&#10;&#10;&quot;A double set of Crossword LEXICON is made containing two complete packs with Red and Blue backs respectively.

All the other sides of the dice are blank. Well, that's not exactly true ... The 2 pip die has a Red Dragon on the face opposite the 2 pips. So, we have 36 sides, but only 7 of the sides have pips and the Red Dragon. Each player starts with 20 points worth of chips. (White = 1 point, Red = 5 points, and Blue = 10 points) Play begins with each player putting 5 points in the pot. On your turn, roll the dice and count the pips. The player then takes that many points out of the pot. If there are not enough points in the pot, then the player adds points to the pot until the pot equals the numbers of pips rolled. There are special payment and rewards for rolling all blanks and for when the Red Dragon is rolled. The first time any player does not have enough points to pay the pot, the set has ended.

On the Invention Track is where you pick up the various inventions (like buying properties in Monopoly). Instead of building house and hotels, you get a Patent Claim Clip attached to the invention card. This patent clip has a 0, 1, or 2 on it. The number assigned is random. The higher patent clip number, the more your patent makes you come royalty collection time. Eureka Cards can also be played that allow you to do special actions during your turn.

The Major beats the Colonel, the Colonel beats the Captain and so on, down to the Special Agents who beat the top ranks.&#10;&#10;A nice version, but loading and unloading the cards into the frames is clumsy.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    L'Attaque&#10;&#10;&#10;";1996;6.47826;2.0
3383;MahÃ©;"In Die Heisse Schlacht am Kalten Buffet, alternatively released as Kangaroo and Generalowsky, players try to win prize cards from the limited number available to them &mdash; but to win they must lap a circular track that (typically) consists of 21 spaces, and not only must they circle the track, but they have to do so while being top dog, so to speak.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player rolls 1-3 six-sided dice to determine whether she moves and if so how far she moves. She rolls the dice one by one, stopping when she wishes, and the sum of the dice rolled can't exceed 7. If she rolls only one die, she moves forward by the number rolled; if she rolled two dice, she moves twice the sum of her dice (if the sum &le; 7); and if she rolled three dice, she moves three times the sum (again, if the sum &le; 7). If her sum exceeds 7, she removes her piece from the board and starts the lap from the beginning next turn.&#10;&#10;If one piece lands on another, the bottom piece must carry the top one when it next moves; what's more, the owner of the piece on top dictates how many dice the bottom player must roll &mdash; and if those dice sum to more than seven, then both pieces are removed from the track. Stacks can have any number of pieces, and whoever is on top dictates to the active player how many dice she must roll. When a piece in the middle of a stack moves, it leaves all pieces below it in place.&#10;&#10;When a piece or a stack lands on or passes the final space in the lap, the owner of the topmost piece takes one of the prize cards; each prize has a value on it, and once all the prizes have been claimed, whoever has the highest sum of prize cards wins.&#10;&#10;The 2014 edition of the game, Mah&eacute;, allows for play with up to seven player turtles, who are circling the island while trying to lay their eggs on the beach and receive points for doing a good job.&#10;&#10;The 2024 Korean edition of the game, &#234;&#179;&#181;&#235;&#163;&#161; &#235;&#140;&#128;&#236;&#158;&#145;&#236;&#160;&#132;, allows for play with up to seven player &#8;adventurers, who are circling the island while taking back stolen eggs on the T-Rex nest and receive points for taking a lot of eggs.&#10;&#10;";1974;6.35908;1.2264
3384;Kerrunch;"In Kerrunch the idea is to score three touchdowns. Starting with the player who won the toss, you take turns trying to move  players to try to get the ball in your opponent's end zone and score a touchdown. When, either, you or your opponent score a touchdown the game is paused while injured players come back on. The two teams then return to their end zones and the game restarts until one team has scored three touchdowns, and won.&#10;&#10;From the box:&#10;&quot;Kerrunch! The title says it all! This is the football game with a difference, where teams of heavily armored Orcs, Dwarfs, Humans and Elves have to fight their way from one end of the pitch to the other to score those elusive touchdowns.&#10;&#10;";1991;5.70465;2.0

3390;Friends;"This is a game invented by the character Ross in episode 12 of the fourth season of the TV program  Friends. It is the same game as played by the characters on the show and as such does not require any knowledge of the TV series itself.&#10;&#10;The players split into two teams - intended to be girls and boys, but this only matters for the bonus questions. Each team takes it in turns to answer yes/no questions about the opposite team in one of four categories:  &quot;Fears and Pet Peeves&quot;, &quot;Ancient History&quot;, &quot;Literature&quot; and &quot;It's all Relative&quot;. This is done by submitting Yes/No cards face down for simultaneous reveal with the correct answer(s) from the other team. Some questions are about one member of the opposite team - in which case all members of the answering team submit a guess - and some questions are of the style &quot;Which of us...?&quot;, in which case the answering team collaborates for a yes/no answer for each member of the opposite team. The goal is to answer the most questions correctly about the other team and have the highest points total at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;There is also a bonus round - and here the gender divide does matter, because the game is designed so that the boys are asking the girls questions that are supposedly hard for the girls to answer but that the boys themselves should easily know the answer to, and vice versa (no answers are provided for the bonus questions). The bonus round is timed and each team answers as many questions correctly as they can within the time limit.&#10;&#10;";1999;4.18791;1.6667

3392;Outlaw & Posse;"This is an abstract strategy game with an Old West theme.  It is inexpensively produced, with a small cardboard board, a 3D cardboard backdrop, and 14 cardboard playing pieces that are inserted into plastic stands.&#10;&#10;One player controls the 13 deputies (the posse), the other controls the 1 outlaw.  The object of the game is for the posse player to surround the outlaw such that he can no longer make a valid move.  If that happens, the posse player wins.  The outlaw player tries not to get cornered and wins if he is able to remove enough deputies from the board such that it is impossible for the posse player to win.&#10;&#10;Play starts with the outlaw player who must move his outlaw each turn, if possible (if not, he loses the game).  He can move the outlaw to any open orthogonally adjacent space.  He can also jump a deputy piece, like in Checkers, and thereby remove the deputy piece from the board.  The outlaw can make multiple jumps in a single turn, again like in Checkers.&#10;&#10;The posse player simply moves one of his deputy pieces into any open orthogonally adjacent space on his turn, trying to create a situation on the board where the outlaw player can not move his piece.&#10;&#10;";1978;6.125;1.0

The spaces on the board contain various instructions on where to move your piece or how much money to receive or pay out.  Players also collect &quot;welfare benefit&quot; and &quot;working person's burden&quot; cards as they progress around the board.

Players take alternate turns moving one piece at a time from the start square and along the board with the ultimate goal of being the first to reach the payoff with all game pieces. Along the way are doors that must be passed thru using keys (card combinations such as a single card, pair, 3 of a kind, or 4 of a kind). There is a fair amount of strategy involved, and often times movements can be planned well in advance. Two of the major features are WHIZ CARDS (count as double) and BONUS PLAYS (additional moves) created by passing through a door. The two-player version is excellent for tournament play.&#10;&#10;";1990;0.0;0.0
3408;This Accursed Civil War;"This Accursed Civil War is a tactical battle game featuring five battles from the First English Civil War: 1642-1646. It is the first in the GMT Musket &amp; Pike Battle System covering warfare in the 17th Century. The system emphasizes Command and Control and the unique style of combat in that era. Armies are divided into three or four wings. Each wing has an order that limits the types of actions that units of that wing may perform. Wings may change their order, but it is not an easy task to accomplish. Victory goes to the commander who can coordinate the actions of these wings in the heat of battle. Units are infantry brigades, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries. Rules include Cavalry Charges, use of the Cavalry's pistols to skirmish or use in close combat, artillery grazing fire, Infantry techniques of fire including advancing, retreating, and salvo firing. Play is highly interactive, and a battle can be played through in one sitting.&#10;&#10;The battles included in this game are:&#10;&#10;Edgehill, 23 October 1642&#10;    Is the King beholden to Parliament or is he truly sovereign? King Charles and his army, their way to London barred by the army of Parliament, have drawn up to give battle. Edgehill was the first major battle of the war. Robert Devereax, Earl of Essex, commands the army of Parliament sent to prevent the King's army from reaching London. The fighting is indecisive as the bloodied Royalist foot fall back, but Essex conceded the field despite receiving reinforcements. A major victory for either side could have ended the war here.&#10;&#10;First Newbury, 20 September 1643&#10;    Outmaneuvered, Essex, with the Royalists under King Charles between his army and London, is forced to fight. Essex spies a hill southwest of Newbury and in the early morning occupies it. Hedges line the area and help minimize the King's advantage in Cavalry.&#10;&#10;Marston Moor, 2 July 1644&#10;    The largest battle of the war. It decided the fate of Northern England. An allied army of Scots under the Earl of Leven, the Northern Association under Ferdinando Fairfax, and the Eastern Association under the Earl of Manchester laid siege to the King's Northern Army under the Marquis of Newcastle at York, the key to the North. King Charles dispatched his nephew, the talented Prince Rupert, to effect a relief. The defeat was complete; the Royalist army was utterly destroyed and the North lost to Parliament. A new hero arises here: Cromwell, a name synonymous with the English Civil War and the key player in the later two civil wars.&#10;&#10;Second Newbury, 27 October 1644&#10;    The disaster that precipitated the forming of the New Model Army. Three Parliamentary armies come together and catch the King by surprise just north of Newbury. The most unconventional of all the battles; the superior Parliamentary force attacks from either end, but is short on time. Various options on gaining more time by shortening the flank march give this action high replay value.&#10;&#10;Naseby, 14 June 1645&#10;    The debut of the New Model Army and the battle that broke the back of the King's army. The New Model Army was created by combining the elements of the major armies in the field. While this worked well for the cavalry, there were serious problems in the infantry ranks. The King's army was outnumbered, but it retained its corps of veteran infantry. The final result was a decisive defeat for the King and the end of his military fortunes. Though fighting would last another year, the King would never field a potent army again.&#10;&#10;2nd Printing Note: This reprint version will include an updated series rulebook and playbook and an Edgehill variant scenario, as well as numerous updates to the counters.

3409;The Napoleonic Wars;"From GMT games:&#10;&#10;In The Napoleonic Wars, GMT Games brings you a fast-paced, tension-filled, card-driven wargame with a point-to-point movement system that pushes the envelope in a new direction for a pivotal period of history. Rooted soundly in Mark Herman's award-winning We The People system, The Napoleonic Wars provides refinements that allow two-to-five players to play an exciting game requiring two to ten hours. The majority of your games will easily end in a single evening, thanks to sudden death victory conditions providing variable game lengths that eliminate the &quot;end of the world&quot; phenomenon that plague many games. Often, you'll set 'em up and knock 'em down twice a night, and once in a great while your Campaign game will require two nights of play for the terrific panoramic history to unfold before your eyes.&#10;&#10;Like similar card-driven games, The Napoleonic Wars provides strategy cards that are played as events or to activate leaders, armies or fleets (by play of command points) to move on the map. Players must constantly weight the value of an event or reaction card against the need for its command points. Command points themselves can be played for a wide variety of activities, making play unpredictable and fresh with each sitting. Uncontrolled powers are governed by a diplomatic track which is also affected by play of command points and events.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;     Napoleonic Wars: Super Deluxe Map&#10;&#10;&#10;Revised by:   &#10;&#10;     The Napoleonic Wars: Update Kit (upgrade to 2nd edition)&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;     Wellington&#10;     The Napoleonic Wars (Second Edition) (aka 2008 reprint Edition)&#10;&#10;&#10;";2002;7.00355;3.4857

3411;Drive on Paris;"Drive on Paris, is a game simulating the first 100 days of fighting on the Western Front during World War I.&#10;&#10;The mobile campaign of 1914 in the west was the result of more than a generation of staff planning on both sides. The German General Staff had prepared the Schlieffen Master Plan of a giant right hook into France which its namesake had hoped would result in a Cannae-like battle of annihilation of France. The French believing that an attack would always win and that elan would carry the day, prepared to assault the lightly held German lines in Alsalce-Lorraine.&#10;&#10;Both plans failed.&#10;&#10;Drive on Paris allows both sides to execute the historical campaigns or variations on them and are rated for victory on how well their operation succeeds. Players can rearrange their Mobilization Points to change the change the force allocations from the historical ones to reinforce their effort or to better counter the enemy's.&#10;&#10;Both side must rapidly attack and defend at the same time...and you'll never have enough troops and power to do both perfectly, so your allocation of scarce resources will be the key to your success.&#10;&#10;This system uses a two-tracked method of determining victory. It isn't the usual &quot;one side tries something, while the other tries to stop it&quot;. Rather, both sides must strive toward their own goals while putting forth enough effort to stall the enemy. It is possible for both sides to &quot;win&quot; ending the game in a net draw (which is why you'll need to dedicate some effort to stopping the enemy support).&#10;&#10;Drive on Paris is the seventh game in the popular, easy-to-play Standard Combat Series. These games are designed to be easy enough for novice players, yet meaty enough to retain the interest of veterans. It violates two principals of game design at the same time: Easy games are dumb, and the converse that interesting games are hard.

3412;Brandywine;"An early morning fog burned off with the dawn, and revealed two long columns of scarlet and blue clad troops. This was His Majesty's Royal Army, commanded by General Sir William Howe. They were marching through the extreme southeastern corner of Pennsylvania and heading toward fledgling America's capital at Philadelphia. Only short weeks earlier this army had disembarked at Head of Elk, Maryland, after a 32-day voyage from New York City aboard the largest armada North America has ever seen. With some 14,000 troops, including crack German mercenaries and elite American Loyalist units, Howe's army was about to execute a flanking maneuver of &quot;Jacksonian&quot; proportions.&#10;&#10;General George Washington, holding interior lines at Morristown, New Jersey, was unsure whether Howe would move north in support of the British invasion from Canada (see Saratoga, 1777), or whether he would move south against the Capital. Once the armada set sail, however, Washington shifted southwest and took up a naturally strong defensive position, on high ground behind Brandywine Creek, astride the main road to Philadelphia. Washington posted his troops advantageously and in depth. Control of the fords of the Brandywine would be the key to his position and although a possible flank attack was discussed, it's likelihood was discounted on the strength of local information.&#10;&#10;Thus the stage was set. Howe, pursuing a strategy of posts, sought European style victory in a sudden taking of the enemy capital. Washington wrote, &quot;Should they push their designs against Philadelphia...they will put the contest on the event of a single battle. If they are overthrown...the war is at an end. One bold stroke will free the land.&quot;&#10;&#10;";2000;7.34188;2.6667
3413;Saratoga;"In all the spectacle of war there has seldom been a sight the equal of British General Burgoyne's campaign of 1777. The float and march south from Canada had almost a surreal quality juxtaposed against the Adirondack wilderness. Hundreds of vessels making up an immense inland navy on Lake Champlain transported nearly 9,000 combatants together with 138 cannon. Burgoyne's objective was Fort Ticonderoga and from there, Albany, and a rendezvous with British forces coming from New York City. The strategic purpose of the campaign was nothing short of an end to the American Rebellion.&#10;&#10;The intrigue on the American side lay in the cult of personality. Saratoga was to be Benedict Arnold's greatest victory in a string of successes which rank him among the finest field commanders of the era. Known to all Americans as the great traitor, it is ironic to discover that twice he salvaged the Revolution from certain collapse. It was Arnold's conspicuous gallantry and bold leadership which assured America victory at Saratoga and, by extension, its independence.&#10;&#10;The fighting at Freeman's Farm would be savage. Here no farmer's militia, but rather Continental Regulars (anxious to redeem a recent reputation for retreat), stood toe to toe with Europe's finest. The sanguinary nature of the fighting was summed up best by American Brigadier General John Glover who said, &quot;Both sides seemed determined to conquer or die.&quot;&#10;&#10;It's the 19th of September, 1777. Do you, as the British, attempt to storm the prepared American positions on the high ground at Bemis Heights in order to open up the River Road and the most direct route to Albany? Or do you attempt to turn the American left where intelligence reports the American defenses are incomplete and the ground favors your approach? How will you employ the large number of Hessian mercenaries in your army? Will their performance match their reputation?&#10;&#10;As the Americans do you wait on Bemis Heights for the approach of the enemy as General Gates preferred, or do you sortie and meet the approach of the British in the forests where their artillery will be of little value? Will Generals Gates and Arnold cooperate, or will their feud spell disaster for the American cause? And what of the fog on this chilly Autumn morning? Will it be an ally to the Americans by impeding the progress of the enemy?&#10;&#10;These are only a few of the challenges facing you as you relive one of history's most decisive battles and the turning point of the American Revolution.&#10;&#10;";1998;7.15032;2.5532

This time, with better-trained and well-equipped troops (armed with new SAGGER anti-tank missiles), the Egyptians clobber the Israeli Bar-Lev defense line. Israel must once again scramble the valiant IDF and fight for its very survival.&#10;&#10;Yom Kippur - The Battle for the Sinai, October 1973 covers the bitter fighting around the Suez Canal during the 1973 October War. Both players must fight against time to win before a ceasefire is mandated by the world superpowers. The tools of the modern battlefield, incredibly destructive weapons like rocket artillery, SAM missiles and airmobile troops, are at their disposal. But despite the bewildering complexity of such computerized weapons, Yom Kippur itself is a simple-to-play, fast and fluid contest.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;    One map&#10;    280 counters&#10;    Series Rules&#10;    Game Rules&#10;    Two Dice&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Details:&#10;&#10;    Unit Scale: Company to Brigade&#10;    Hex Scale: 2 miles / hex&#10;    Number of Players: 2 (also solitaire friendly)&#10;    Playing Time: Varies with scenario played&#10;    Complexity: Low&#10;    Solitaire Suitability: High&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Part of the Standard Combat Series.&#10;&#10;Also published in Command Magazine Japan #65 in 2005.&#10;&#10;";1995;7.03904;2.5849

3416;Fallschirmjaeger: The Airborne Assault on Fortress Holland;"Fallschirmjaeger: The Airborne Assault on Fortress Holland May 10 to 14, 1940, simulates the German May, 1940 capture of Rotterdam and The Hague (Den Haag).&#10;&#10;In the spring of 1940, the German military machine turned west to convert the Phoney War into a real one. Fresh from his victory in Poland, Hitler planned a blow that would knock France out of the war. key to this plan was knife-like attack through the Ardennes to the English Channel which would split the Allied forces moving north to block the expected replay of 1914 and the Maginot Line forces immobile in the south. To add to the trap, the Germans planned the first massive airborne operation of the war. This attack would capture the hinterland of Holland, pave the way for subordinate German Armored thrusts crossing the Maas, and to continue the lure the Allies northward.&#10;&#10;Fallschirmjaeger covers this bait. The German player plops down an airborne invasion force with the goal of fighting off all-comers until relieved by advancing ground forces. The Dutch, all but abandoned by their French and British Allies, put up a fight for the record books. The German air bridge held on by its fingernail. While the main German drive was never in doubt, these scattered paratroopers had the fight of their lives against a small nation unwilling to succumb without giving the fight everything.&#10;&#10;In the end, the Dutch government had to be evacuated along with the Dutch Gold Reserve, to form a government in exile. They would return after liberation.&#10;&#10;The player must do all these things, or smash the German paratroopers before they are rescued by the Panzers, to win. Any German player thinking he'll have an easy time, must be reminded his is not Nazi Germany's main effort and that he must make-do on a shoestring.&#10;&#10;Fallschirmjaeger is the eighth game in the popular Standard Combat Series by The Gamers. Following last year's smash hit of Drive on Paris, Al Wambold returns to show this under-represented battle in great detail, much of which, from original Dutch records...and, yes, Dutch researchers were used to confirm the accuracy of the map!&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 8 hours&#10;Hex: 0.6 miles / 1 Km&#10;Units: Platoon &amp; Company&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color map&#10;Two dual-side printed countersheet (560 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 8-page SCS version 1.6 system rulebook&#10;One 16-page Fallschirmjaeger specific rulebook&#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&#10;Complexity Level: Low&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2-12 hours&#10;&#10;";2001;7.73403;3.0417
3417;Tribulation;"In Tribulation, number tiles are laid out in a 7 x 7 grid, similarly to Boggle.  Each tile has a number from 1 to 9 on it (the 9 tile is also used as a 6 in some editions).  Number disks from 1-50 are shuffled, and one is drawn.  Players race to find three tiles whose equation (first times second, plus or minus third, or any other combination of two tiles multiplied and the other added or subtracted) adds to that total.  The first to do so wins the disk.  Whomever has the most disks when they are all claimed wins the game.&#10;&#10;Nominally the game is for 1-6 players, although the upper bound is arbitrary and the rules say nothing about how the game might be played solo. Possible solo challenges involve seeing how many tokens you can claim in a set time (e.g. 10 minutes total) or how many tokens you can claim racing against a countdown timer (e.g. 5-10 seconds per token).&#10;&#10;";1974;5.81127;1.5

3420;Tip the Cows!;"This small beer &amp; pretzels game is a virtual clone of Pass the Pigs. It containing 2 cow dice, a pen, a score pad, and a rule/scoring all contained in a small imitation leather wallet.&#10;&#10;The goal is to have the highest score at the end of 7 rounds of rolling. On your turn, you roll the cow dice (little cow miniatures) and try to get positions which score points. After most rolls you can bank your points and pass the dice or continue rolling. One roll, a &quot;milk dud&quot; with both cows on their sides, brand side up, halves your current points this round and forces you to pass the dice. Other rolls have various point values, or cause you to lose all accumulated points or win the game instantly.&#10;&#10;";1989;5.11111;1.0
3421;StreetSoccer;"StreetSoccer is the name in the Netherlands (Dutch: Straatvoetbal) for how soccer is played in parks or squares in cities and villages.&#10;In this game 2 StreetSoccer teams play a 25 'minute' match. &#10;The soccer field is 10 spaces long and 6 wide (plus spaces outside the lines).&#10;The 2 players of this game both are coaches of one team. &#10;Both coaches have 5 StreetSoccer player figures (incl. the goalie). &#10;A die determines your number of spaces to move one of your figures. If you reach the ball you shoot the ball by the unused number of pips on the die plus one, and can make passes between players of your team. &#10;The die makes luck a part of this game. But your choices, like which player you move to which field and where to pass the ball are very important. For the following turns you calculate chances for your opponent and yourself and you try to have your players in good positions for later situations.&#10;&#10;";2002;6.52492;1.5381

3423;Equations;"Special 6-sided dice with numbers and arithmetic symbols on them are rolled out at the start of each round. A &quot;goal&quot; expression is formed, and then players take turns moving one cube at a time to one of three areas: Forbidden, Permitted, or Required. Each move is supposed to keep possible the ability to eventually form an expression equal to the goal, but it must not be possible to form such an expression immediately if there are still cubes remaining in the resources pile. Players may challenge each other if they believe a move has rendered impossible any expression that equals the goal, or if an expression can be formed prematurely. When a challenge is issued, all other players decide which side they want to be on. The side claiming that an expression is possible, has the burden of proof to create such an expression. The final expression must use all the Required cubes, none of the Forbidden cubes, and as many Permitted cubes as desired. Expressions are written down; the cubes are not moved. Parentheses may be inserted as desired. Rounds continue until some agreed condition is met (high score reached, or number of rounds).&#10;&#10;";1963;6.67143;3.0
3425;Skunk;"Similar to Cosmic Wimpout, but much easier and kid friendly.  This is a very simple point-scoring/risk-taking game in which players roll a set of two dice, where the &quot;1&quot; has been replaced by a picture of a skunk.  Everyone gets little poker chips, like in many gambling games, and a player rolls as much as he wishes during his turn, earning points equal to what he rolls. A player passes the dice when he wishes, but if he rolls one or two skunks, points rolled during that turn are ignored and penalties (in the form of discarding some of their poker chips) are enforced.  First player to achieve 100 points (or higher) wins that round, and play continues for as long players wish.  The winner is whoever has the most chips to his name (in typical poker values of 1, 5, and 10).  Number of max players seems to be only limited by the number of poker chips you use (each player starts with 50). This game is no longer manufactured, at least under the theme of &quot;Skunk.&quot;&#10;&#10;At least one BGG member has a copy dated 1953, but it's possible the game came out earlier.&#10;&#10;";1953;5.75472;1.0

You play attack cards on other players from your hand of 5 until either you run out of cards or another player plays a defensive card.  Cards can set up combo's and some can redirect the attack elsewhere.&#10;&#10;Cards have appropriate pictures of the Stooges covering the whole card based on what the card is.  The cards come in the varieties you would expect such as Poke in the Eye, Duck and of course Nyuck! Nyuck! Nyuck!.

3432;PSI;"PSI stands for Psychology Slander Intuition. This is a party game in which a person's character is described as a comparison to an object. Player's counters are the 7 deadly sins, Sloth, Avarice etc. You draw a Personality card, giving a clue to the type, eg sports, politician etc, the next player draws a PSI card and asks &quot;If you were a Language/ Salad Dressing/Letter Of The Alphabet, which would you be?&quot;. You're supposed to answer as if you were the personality and the questioner is supposed to guess who you are. If they guess correctly, they advance along a track, if they fail, the next player tries another question and so on. If no-one guesses correctly, you reverse down the track for giving bad clues. The hilarious party element is that the Personality cards include the Sins, so you would answer as if you were that player.&#10;&#10;";1987;3.92;1.25

3434;Golden Deuce;"This game is based on the ancient Chinese game of Choi Dai Di (Known as 'Big Two' in English, similar to Pusoy Dos in the Philippines).  This special deck, however, has 60 cards, instead of the standard 52, which changes (for the better) the odds of the game and increases the strategy involved.  Another difference from the classic game, is that the publishers have added a game board for keeping score, adding even more strategy, because players have choices on how to move their pawns.&#10;&#10;The game starts with a round of the Golden Deuce card game - lay down higher tricks than the other players for control of the lead. Be the first player to lay down all the cards in your hand, and you gain points for all the cards left in the other players' hands.&#10;&#10;Moving to the game board, each player strategically moves any of their pawns the number of spaces to match the points earned in the card game round. Players can choose to move all of their pawns around the board at once (and therefore be able to block out opponents) or move one at a time (and capitalize on the amount of spaces moved).&#10;&#10;Once all players have moved, another card game round starts, and the game ends when one player has moved all of their pawns to the finish.&#10;&#10;";2002;5.41174;1.6875

They form two teams and with the help of a garden hose that they place under a fence, the gnomes organize a Tug-of-War. They shout, moan, swear, and insult each other. Sweat streams down in large drops from under their gnomish hats. They try to pull together at the fence. Squirrels from the neighborhood hurry to gather there. They can&rsquo;t sleep with all the noise and they gather at the garden's edge in order to watch the spectacle.&#10;&#10;Garden dwarves make a &quot;pull the rope&quot; competition. During his turn, each player plays a card which allows him to add a dwarf of a certain color on his side of the rope or to make dwarves of a particular color stronger (or weaker). When dwarves are actually pulling the rope, you slide a part of the cute little board.&#10;&#10;";1997;5.74282;1.1333

3437;Gogol;"Gogol was conceived in a prison, where no paper or pencils were allowed. Designed to be playable under the most primitive circumstance, each move in Gogol sets off firecrackers of endless possibility!&#10;There are two players (White and Black), each having one king and eight pawns at their command.&#10;On a common chessboard, place eight white pawns on the first rank and eight black pawns on the eighth. Then, the White player may place his king anywhere on the board, except on the second rank. Black, in turn, places his king anywhere except on the seventh rank.  The game then starts, each player moving in turn.&#10;The pawns are free to move anywhere on the board, not being confined to moving along lines or diagonals! (You can think of this as &quot;teleportation&quot;.)  The king may move along any straight line or diagonal, like a chess Queen.  &#10;If a piece begins its turn adjacent to an enemy piece, then it can capture the enemy piece by jumping over it (straight or diagonally), and landing into an empty on the other side of (and adjacent to) the captured piece.&#10;The player who captures the enemy king, or reaches the last rank with his own king, wins the game.&#10;For more information, please go to http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/gogol.htm&#10;&#10;";2002;6.075;2.0

Some characters will pivot from long range to close quarters combat styles, others will move from acting aggressively to stealing their opponent's energy.

Judging by the number of boards and playing pieces found in Roman sites, Ludus Latrunculorum appears to have been an extremely popular game, played extensively throughout the Roman Empire.&#10;&#10;In Ludus Romanus we aim to capture the spirit of an ancient Roman pastime whilst providing a contemporary game that is challenging and fun to play.&#10;&#10;";1996;5.26364;2.2857

3456;The Hieroglyphs Game;"Each player has a sheet showing words written in Egyptian hieroglyphs. Players roll a die and move around a board showing the glyphs, and put a counter on their sheet as their glyphs are reached. A simplistic game, more educational than fun, but nicely packaged with the rules written on a scroll tied with ribbon.&#10;&#10;From the back of the box:&#10;&#10;Involving both skill and chance, the game is an entertaining introduction to one of the oldest and most beautiful of written languages. Whilst no previous knowledge of this ancient script is required, play is designed to help you recognize a range of the more commonly found hieroglyphs - making future viewing of Egyptian exhibits even more exciting!&#10;&#10;The game involves moving a scarab beetle around the board in an effort to collect the signs necessary to spell a given hieroglyphic word. Whilst attempting to do this, you are at the same time trying to thwart your opponents' efforts to complete their words.&#10;&#10;The colorful game board displays the 24 signs of the basic hieroglyphic alphabet, plus a small selection of the seven hundred other signs used by Ancient Egyptian scribes.&#10;&#10;Contents: &#10;One Scarab Beetle Playing Piece &#10;One Die &#10;One Full color Board &#10;Eight Hieroglyphic Word Sheets &#10;One Rule Scroll &#10;Twenty Black Counters&#10;&#10;";1989;3.73684;2.0

3458;The Celtic Game;"Supposedly themed on a Celtic game called Tawlbwrdd (Throw-board), referred to the in the Howel Dha, this version greatly resembles the Viking game Hnefatafl. One set of pieces is on the outside of the board, trying to capture the other sides King. The King's army tries to protect his dash to the edge of the board and freedom. Moves are based on dice rolls. The board is styled with Celtic knot work designs. Rules in English, French and Japanese.&#10;&#10;";1997;4.81818;0.0
3459;Major Battles and Campaigns of General George S. Patton;"You command the armies (one player plays the Allies forces and one player plays the German forces) during three of the greatest battles of WWII (that Patton participated in, of course). Three complete games are included: Sicily-Invade and capture Italy's southern island fortress, Normandy Breakout-Direct the critical campaign on the sweep to Berlin, and Battle of the Bulge-The daring breakthrough to Bastogne.  A two-sided (19&quot; x 26&quot;) game board is provided.&#10;&#10;The game maps are historically accurate, as well as the initial troop deployments. Troop movement per turn is dictated by 24 troop movement cards. Allied and German units are 112 die cut cardboard pieces. Battles are resolved using 5 red and 5 white battle dice.&#10;&#10;The game plays very well for a wargame of its age. The troop movement card deck works better than one might think. Moving the little cardboard counters is typical of wargames of this era. And the battle resolution based upon rolling multiples of any number seems unbalanced at first, but after a few plays you realize that it too works as well as the troop movement card deck.  Two very innovative wargaming mechanisms that allow for quick movement and battle resolution. Thus the game moves fast, but does not sacrifice battle and movement detail(s).&#10;&#10;Copyright (c) 1973 RGI - Research Games, Inc and ATHOL Game Co., 200 Fifth Ave., New York, NY 10010&#10;&#10;Also see: Major Campaigns of General Douglas MacArthur&#10;&#10;";1973;6.44052;1.7619
3460;Kaubojai;"Players move around the board and are able to buy ranches. Each ranch differs in cost and maximum capacity of cattle. When player buys ranch, he is also able to buy some cattle. Each time player will pass the ranch again the cattle number will double, until it will reach the maximum number. When player stops on ranch, he/she may take some cattle and bring to town to sell (if he will take all cattle, he will have to sell ranch since ranch cannot be left without cattle). However, since each time cattle doubles, it is better to wait until it grows. But, yet again, you may not step on a ranch for a long time later; so, you may loose cattle if number will reach maximum. Also, you may steal other players&rsquo; cattle by stepping on their ranches. If you do so, you will have to reach town without being captured by the player you stole cattle from. Players, if their cattle is stolen, can chase thieves not only through ordinary routes, but also through cutaways, however if he will use them, he could lose ability to step on his ranches and take cattle to town for sell. If thief is captured, he must give cattle to owner and pay fine. Each robbed ranch is automatically sold to bank and could be bought again. If player steps on casino, he/she could play for money. Player could then bid money and roll die. If it rolls 1, 3 or 5, player looses money. If it rolls 2, 4 or 6 he takes his money back and also the same amount of money from bank. The game automatically ends after 60 minutes; so, it has to be played with clock or chronometer.&#10;&#10;This game was released by Azar in Lithuania and could be unknown elsewhere.

3461;OrkoMondo;"A relatively simple, tile-placing strategy game in which players choose an army to portray (Orc, Elf, Human, Dwarf).  After two dice are rolled, players can place units of their army on a small 6X6 board according to the coordinates on the dice.  Playing units in this manner costs &quot;Shield Points&quot; (which go into a kitty obtained by the player who deploys all his units first) and despite the light theme of combat between units, the game is actually won by the player who has the most shield points at the end (thus being the most resourceful).  OrkoMondo is part of KidultGames' series of free, downloadable games.&#10;&#10;";2002;5.70455;1.3333
3462;Savana;"In this game players have to climb a mountain. The one who does that the first wins.&#10;&#10;At the start all players take chance tokens and place them upside down on various board tiles. Later each player gets energy tokens. Then they roll the die and move as many tiles as the number they rolled. If a player wants, he/she could lose one (or more) of his energy tokens and go climb as many spaces as the number of energy tokens he/she gave up. If player steps on a chance token, he/she must take it and do whatever it says. There are various tokens - some orders to go some spaces up or down, some orders to roll die again. If player takes a card with a lion or aborigines, he must fight by placing any number of energy tokens between 1 and 5 and rolling die. If rolled number is higher than tokens placed, player will lose. If player   loses to the aborigines, they will rob him/her and the player will lose all energy tokens. If player loses against the lion, he will have to fight again and again (each fight is one turn). If player loses all of his/her energy tokens, he/she loses the game. If player passes another player, he/she must give him/her one energy token. If player steps on tile occupied by other player, that other player must give him/her energy token. If player wins against lion, he must go back to the nearest village. If two players step on lion at the same time, they must fight against the lion together by placing energy tokens. They can place no more than 5 tokens as a group. &#10; This game was released by Azar in Lithuania so it could be unknown in other parts of the world.&#10;&#10;";0;2.0;0.0

3471;Le Mans;"The great-grandfather of today's racing games, elements of Le Mans are clearly evident in games like Formula D&eacute;.  Le Mans offers the choice of twelve different car specifications that detail the number of spaces the car travels in each gear and which gears the cars can safely negotiate turns.  Also, the different car types have different braking characteristics.&#10;&#10;The game includes two tracks printed on the same board, Monte Carlo and Le Mans.  Each track is only two lanes wide, and the spaces on the track are only a half-car-length, so a car takes up two spaces at once.&#10;&#10;The cars move in order of track position. Each turn, a car may either remain in the same gear, shift up one gear, or shift down according to the car's specifications.  It must then move the exact number of spaces required by the particular model of car in the specified gear.&#10;&#10;When cornering, if a car exceeds the gear specified for the particular model of car, it must &quot;take a chance.&quot;  The driver must roll the die to determine if the car safely cornered, spun out, crashed, or damaged the car such that a pit stop is required.  If a car spins out, a &quot;wet track&quot; marker is placed on the corner, subsequently requiring all cars to roll for a chance when going through it.&#10;&#10;If a car is blocked and cannot move the entire number of spaces required (and the car has no more hard braking left and cannot down shift enough), the cars collide.  Collisions require that the involved cars make a pit stop for repairs.&#10;&#10;Optional rules include guidelines for slipstreaming, over-revving to move an extra space, and details of team, solo, and timed play, and &quot;Le Mans-style&quot; starts.&#10;&#10;The game is a revised version of Wright-Mudge Enterprises' Grand Prix: A Sports Car Racing Game.&#10;&#10;";1961;6.48199;2.1818

3473;RisiKard!;"Risikard is similar to Risk in that players are warring over global territories. However, in Risikard, battles are resolved by use of cards, instead of dice, and the board serves more as a visual indicator than a gaming area.&#10;&#10;The game consists of 1 small map board, 2 tank pieces, a rule book and 110 cards.&#10;&#10;There are 42 Territory Cards, each representing one of the areas on the map. Of the information on these cards, the most important are the number 'Value', of which a certain amount are needed to win the game, and the 'Winning Symbol' (explained below). There are 54 Army Cards and one Wild Card. All army cards have symbols representing either infantry, cavalry or artillery and a value from 1-6. There are also 13 Mission Cards, which remain hidden to others throughout the game, and state the formula one must obtain to win.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, territories are selected one at a time and starting army hands and a mission card are drawn.&#10;&#10;Each turn then commences with an attack by declaring war on an adjacent territory. Cards are revealed from the attacker and defenders hand and whoever has the higher number wins, the wild card trumping any other value. When one player wins two battles, that person gains the other's territory card.&#10;&#10;The second stage of the turn is the protection of territories. In this turn you may choose to defend territories by presenting three Territory Cards with different 'Winning Symbols' from the same continent (also known as a &quot;set&quot;). Protected territories may not be attacked but also can't aid to increase your number of army cards. Army cards in hand are then discarded and the same number of cards are drawn at which point the player may attack again.&#10;&#10;In the final stage of a turn, the player adjusts his/her hand based on the number of sets that aren't part of protected territories that they control.&#10;&#10;The game is won when a player fulfills the requirements of the 'victory formula' stated on his/her Mission Card. An example of this formula is you must control all of Africa, Oceania and you must have additional territories totalling a value of 12 or more. Players can be eliminated from the game prior to the game's end.&#10;&#10;";1996;5.45;1.5

3484;Armada;"A board game with a nicely realized island group, which offers protection for either four nations or four pirate bands (depending on the edition) and indigenous people. Components: 300 plastic markers, 150 tokens, 8 ships made of metal with 2 masts, 55 cards (3rd edition only), 3 six-sided special dice, 1 rules booklet.&#10;&#10;Between the second and third edition, the theme of the game changed. The first and second have a theme of four nations exploring and colonizing new land, while the third edition has a pirate theme. The third edition also adds 55 action cards, resulting in more chaos and - possibly - less strategy (at least that's what is suggested in the rules).&#10;&#10;The board shows an island group composed of five smaller island groups separated by ocean. There is a large island group in the middle and four smaller ones in the corners. The four smaller island groups are the homelands of the four nations in editions 1 and 2 and the pirate bases in edition 3. Nations / pirates set out to explore and conquer the big island group in the middle (or each others' homelands).&#10;&#10;Every round, each nation / pirate group has 10 action points. With these you can accomplish various actions: move, load ships, explore unknown areas, attack your opponents, etc. Most important action is probably exploration, in which you roll two special dice which determine how many natives and how much gold there is in a neighboring, unexplored land. You'll have to fight the natives to conquer that land and get the gold. The gold itself you use to muster new armies / pirates. Conquest ultimately decides the winner.&#10;&#10;In the 3rd edition, you can use special cards to optimize your course or counter the actions of opponents. Thus you have a large freedom of movement, unfortunately your opponents do also.&#10;&#10;A winner of the 1986 Concours International de Cr&#195;&#169;ateurs de Jeux de Soci&#195;&#169;t&#195;&#169;.&#10;&#10;";1986;5.21273;2.1667

These are claimed by placing a castle and cathedral on the specified area of the map board.&#10;&#10;Play commences with the Administrative Phase where players collect taxes based on the number of territories and cathedrals they control. Following is the Military phase that is divided into three optional steps. The first is to roll 2d6 for a random event that will cause the player to either gain or lose money, lose cards, lose castles or become the pope. The second option is to build new castles on your territories. The final is an attack on another person's territory.&#10;&#10;Territories can attack adjacent territories or those on the same body of water. The attacking and defensive force are determined by the number of castles on each territory. For each castle on his/her territory, the attacker and defenders each roll a die and apply any modifiers obtained by cathedrals or cards in his/her possession. Results of 6 or over destroy a castle of the opposing side. If all of the defenders castles are lost, the attacker wins the territory, places a castle to claim it and may draw a card at the end of the phase. Cards offer various benefits such as money, attack/defence points or game actions.&#10;&#10;Play continues until one player controls 8 cathedrals.&#10;&#10;... and apparently the castles are cute.&#10;&#10;";1995;5.96271;1.7273

3499;3-D Chess;"There are many forms of 3D Chess, the earliest being Kubicschach, which is German for Cubic Chess and was designed by the French Chess master Lionel Adalbert Bagration Felix Kieseritzky, in 1851.&#10;Kubicschach, as the name suggests, is eight standard Chess boards stacked up to for an 8x8x8 cube, it never became a popular game.&#10;&#10;Kubicschach was reduced by Doctor Ferdinand Maack in 1907, to five 5x5 boards and renamed Raumschach, which is German for Space Chess.&#10;It was played a lot in Germany during the beginning of the 20th century.&#10;&#10;The Dynamic Games company first produced a three 8x8 board in 1973 and sold it under the name Strato Chess. The game has been copied by many companies since and is the most widely available of all 3D Chess boards.&#10;&#10;The most famous variant of 3D Chess appeared in the Star Trek television show in 1966, in which it was referred to as 'Three Dimensional Chess'.&#10;The original stage property was designed by Irving A Feinberg and consisted of three 4x4 boards and four movable 2x2 boards.&#10;It was developed into a real game by the technical designer Franz Joseph Schnaubelt in his 1975 book, the Star Fleet Technical Manual and improved by a fan and chess player Andrew Bartmess, whose rules are some of the most popular.&#10;Fans of Star Trek still call it 'Three Dimensional Chess' but players of the game call it by the title Schnaubelt popularised 'Tri Dimensional Chess'.&#10;&#10;In 1985, the game design Gary Gygax published rules for Dragon Chess in Dragon magazine.&#10;A Dragon Chess board is three 8x12 boards stacked up and includes the extra pieces: Sylph, Griffon, Dragon, Warrior, Oliphant, Unicorn, Hero, Thief, Cleric, Mage, Paladin, Dwarf, Basilisk and Elemental.&#10;&#10;Max Chappell started designing Hyperchess in the early '70s but didn't produce and sell the first commercial set until 1996.&#10;Although it was influenced by the tri dimensional chess board, it has been described as more helical in design.&#10;&#10;In 2001 William d&#039;Agostino recreated the Strato Chess board and called it Millenium Chess, with the idea of extending Classic Chess, whithout distorting the game.&#10;&#10;";1851;5.92061;4.0714
3500;Schmuggler an Bord;"The game consists of a board, showing 30 different types of contraband goods, Gold, Cigarettes etc, each marked by a small picture and it's name. Each picture has a matching tile, which is placed face down over it. Players each receive a number of chips and then take two or three (depending on the number of players), of the tiles for themselves, announcing which they have taken and then laying them face down in front of them. Now play begins.&#10;&#10;The players take turns to roll the die and then move around the board. At first they generally land on a space where the picture is covered by a tile. They take this tile for themselves, and lay it face down in front of them announcing as they do so which it was. As the tiles start to disappear though, players land on spaces where the tile is already missing. They then have to say who they think has that tile. If correct, they receive the tile. If the named player however thinks that he hasn't got the tile, then he may in turn name another player, and so on until either a named player accepts that he has the tile, or a player who has already been named is named again. Then it is sorted out who really did have the tile, working backwards through the chain of accusations until it is found. The owner, when unmasked, passes it to the first player correctly to have named him, and all players who have falsely accused someone must pay chips into the Bank, one chip for each false accusation made in that turn.&#10;&#10;Obviously, the passing on of tiles complicates matters terribly. It is simple enough to remember who took the tile in the first place, but by the time you have unraveled a chain of four or five false accusations, trying to remember who now has the tile is not so simple. The game goes on until either someone has collected a specified number of tiles, dependent on the number of players, or someone has no chips left. A player's tiles count two points each and every remaining chip one point, so it is quite possible to win without collecting many tiles, you merely have to avoid guessing falsely.&#10;(Jon Webley from GameCabinet)&#10;&#10;";1992;6.09923;1.25

3502;Star of the Guardians;"Star of the Guardians is a 2-player Collectible Card Game in which the players play cards to deploy spaceships and destroy each other's empire.  The game is set in a science-fiction setting of the same name, novelized in a 4-book series by Margaret Weis.  For the game, players buy (collect) cards to build up their decks, which are shuffled and from which cards are drawn into hands and played.&#10;&#10;Players take on the roles of Warlords and to deploy their navies, they play system cards, which bestow Influence points.  Other cards can then be played if their cost in Influence are met.  Personality cards provide special abilities and personality points, which are required to play certain cards.  Fate, Damage, Artifacts and Tactics cards are played to alter the outcomes of battles fought among the deployed naval ships (Battleships, Carriers, Destroyers, etc) and squadrons of fighters and bombers.&#10;&#10;Star of the Guardians uses a lane-based combat system (Lane-To-Lane&trade;).  Each player's fleet is deployed in five columns (lanes).  The frontline ships bear the brunt of the fight while the ships behind them can give support, depending on their positions and cards played.  When a player's fleet has been destroyed, his or her home system is open to attack.  Any damage done to a player's home system reduces his or her power, and when a player's power has been reduced to zero, he or she loses the game.&#10;&#10;";1995;4.48063;2.0

Game play is the same as the classic board game except for a few interesting twists:&#10;&#10;&middot; When you attack an opponent&rsquo;s piece, the computer tells you whether you have won, lost, or tied.  So you do not know the exact strength of the opposing piece, only its strength relative to your own piece (and so too your opponent does not know the exact strength of the piece you used to attack with).  This feature makes the game quite a bit more interesting than standard Stratego.&#10;&#10;&middot; Instead of moving one of your pieces on your turn, you can &ldquo;probe&rdquo; an opposing piece to find its strength.  You will not be given its exact strength, but instead what &ldquo;class&rdquo; it is in (8-9, 5-7, or all else)&#10;&#10;&middot; Bombs are no longer playing pieces but are hidden features on your side of the board that are programmed into the game.

3549;Superpower;"The object of Superpower is to control as much of the Third World as possible by the end of the game.  The game uses several decks of cards, a roll and move game track, and voting rights based on the number of third world countries 'owned'.  A player chooses between one of four actions on his turn:  Moving his pawn on the board via die roll; military fortification of a previously influenced country; military response to another player's prior coup d'etat against a non-fortified country; or attempt an invasion of a non-fortified country.  The game centers around keeping other players' military influence markers out of strategically valued countries, and installing your own influence and subsequent fortifications in same.  Once a country has military fortifications installed, it is immune from all further actions.  Unfortunately for the warmongers, world opinion is constantly being lowered by hostile actions, and propaganda efforts must be maintained to keep world opinion high enough for successful actions.  Of course, before you can militarily influence anybody, you have to get economic influence going, and the various spaces on the board track take care of giving everybody opportunity for same.&#10;&#10;";1986;4.31561;2.0909

3563;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring;"Choose to play the forces of good or evil and recreate some of the most memorable battles on Middle Earth.&#10;&#10;A hobby more than a game much along the lines of Games Workshop&#039;s Warhammer Series.  This game is much smaller, simpler, and random than the Warhammer Series.&#10;&#10;Battles are resolved with simple D6 rolls with the highest roll winning, individual stats only used to decide ties.&#10;&#10;Games Workshop supports this game strongly, with a wide miniature range and a large set of expansions.&#10;&#10;The Fellowship of the Ring boxed game contains: One (1) 128 page full-color rulebook, forty-eight (48) highly detailed plastic miniatures: eight (8) Men of Gondor, sixteen (16) High Elf Warriors and twenty-four (24) Moria Goblins with various evil implements of destruction, ruined building scenery, and enough six-sided dice to get you playing right away.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    The Lord of the Rings: Strategy Battle Game&#10;&#10;&#10;Integrates with:&#10;&#10;    The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&#10;    The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&#10;&#10;&#10;";2001;6.57091;2.8462
3565;Mordheim: City of the Damned;"Mordheim does to Warhammer Fantasy what Necromunda does to Warhammer 40k. The game mechanics work in classic Games Workshop fashion.&#10;&#10;Instead of playing with hundreds of miniatures, you pick a warband of 1-20 models (most average at 10-12 or so), and fight a skirmish with other warbands. If you play well, your warband gains money, levels, size, and new powers, but play badly and your warband slowly deteriorates as people die or otherwise get dismembered.&#10;&#10;Games actually play very similar to Necromunda but due to the fantasy setting you should see fewer long distance shots, and a lot more hand to hand fighting.&#10;&#10;";1999;7.34784;3.0942

3571;Spitfire: Tactical Aerial Combat in Europe 1939-42;"Individual aircraft and small group combat during WWII. &#10;Bomber and air superiority missions.&#10;255 Counters&#10;&#10;Planes represented are from the early war in the European theatre. The game's namesake, for example, appears in the Mark 1 and Mark V versions only.&#10;It uses a simplified system for maneuver and combat that emphasizes game play over realism, and is very playable. Realism buffs will want to modify the rules or look for a different game.  Changes in a plane's status are recorded by moving counters rather than using a pencil and paper.  Changes in elevation, for example, are indicated by moving a counter along a looped Climb Progress track (different in length for each plane) until passing the 'top', which means the plane has climbed to the next level. At this point the counter on the board representing the plane is replaced with one showing its new level (numbered 1 - 20). Hits are noted on the speed track, such that the plane's maximum speed is reduced as it takes more hits, until the stall speed is reached, when the plane is considered shot down. Each plane uses a unique firing table printed on its record card.&#10;A plane's maneuverability is characterized by its ratings for turns, barrel rolls, wing-overs, and diving costs, as well as its acceleration.&#10;Play set scenarios, or simply pit your favourite planes against each other in a dog fight!&#10;&#10;";1973;5.82639;2.7778

3581;Lion of the North: The Dawn of Modern Warfare, 1631-1632;"(From the publisher)&#10;The war for minds and souls had been raging for ten destructive years when the vaunted, virtually undefeated Catholic army of the Hapsburg emperor and his allied German states looked across the gentle valley of Breitenfeld directly into the blinding rays of the dawn of modern warfare. By the end of the day, Tilly's lumbering army lay smashed beyond redemption, the victim of rapid-firing artillery, fast-moving infantry and hard-charging cavalry. The prediction had come true: Breitenfeld signaled the ascendancy of Gustavus II Adolphus, King of Sweden, the Lion of the North.&#10;&#10;Lion of the North is the third volume in GMT's heralded Great Battles of History (GBoH) Series. The Thirty Years' War signaled the dawn of modern warfare ... a return to the supremacy of linear tactics, drill and discipline, to what some historians call &quot;the return of the legion.&quot; Lion of the North represents two of the most famous battles of that period:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Breitenfeld, 1631&#10;    Lutzen, 1632&#10;&#10;&#10;Scale:&#10;Time = 30 minutes per turn&#10;Map = 100 yards per hex&#10;Unit = 100 men per strength point&#10;&#10;&#10;This is in the line of GBOH games which include Alexander, SPQR, Caesar: The Civil Wars, Caesar: Conquest of Gaul, and Cataphract.

3585;Sorcerer: The Game of Magical Conflict;"Sorcerer is a fantasy wargame. Each player has an army consisting of Sorcerers, human infantry, and magical units (trolls, demons, and dragons). Sorcerers specialize in types of magic represented by 7 different colors. Sorcerer adds a twist to the old &quot;combat differential&quot; system (attack strength minus defense strength) by adding a circular system of combat bonuses based upon what colors of magic are attacking each other; Blue/Green/Yellow/Grey/Orange/Red/Purple with each color having a strong advantage over it's neighbor to the right (with Purple circling around to have power over Blue) and a disadvantage against it's neighbor to the left, with lessening combat bonuses the further away the color is from itself. Combat bonuses are also given based on map position as the hexes alternate colors of magic instead of representing physical terrain. Attacking from one's own color is good.&#10;&#10;Several different scenarios are included in the rulebook that range from 1 to 6 players.&#10;&#10;";1975;5.65556;2.6786

The cards have various statements and I think the other players must judge your reaction before you can progress to the finish. Not exactly a party game, I think this is meant to be testing if not disturbing! Lots of German text, unplayable for non-German speakers.&#10;&#10;";1983;5.25;1.5

3601;MegaNation;"MegaNation is a game of worldwide power politics.  Each player runs a nation in a fantasy &quot;modern&quot; world.  Each nation controls one or more areas on the board and is defined by &quot;factors&quot; assigned each turn to various attributes: Population, Education, Industry, Military, etc.  The winner is determined by a formula at the end of the game (which occurs on a random turn) using these attributes.  Each turn consists of random events (generated by die rolls), followed by allocating of 8 new &quot;factors&quot; to their nation's attributes, followed by actions on the board.  There are strategic resources (oil, gold, coal, ore, and rare minerals) which affect the allocation of factors and/or movement on the board.  Combat can occur between nations using military factors from the nations' attributes, resolution done by drawing as many numbered chits for losses as there are opposing military factors.  These can be modified by die roll, if desired.  Negotiation between players for resources, military assistance, travel routes, etc., is highly encouraged and virtually required by the design of the game.&#10;&#10;From the designer October 24, 2009:&#10;MegaNation continues with Collegiate Edition 3.3 and a simplified &quot;Family Edition&quot; for the &quot;little and older folks&quot;!&#10;&#10;";1990;5.43333;2.0

There are two identical maps, one for each player each hidden from the other.  Hexes are 10km, each turn 3 days, counters are from regiments to divisions.  Each turn consists of multiple movement and combat phases for each player.  Movement into enemy territory is done by stating the hex you wish to enter.  The opposing player must state if he has a unit in that hex, if not movement succeeds and may continue.  If so, an attack may take place if desired, and may involve multiple units on both sides with the attacker coming from one or more hexes.  Units are only revealed during combat.  Combat losses are in steps (7-8 becomes 5-8, then 3-8, then 1-8, then elim, etc) and determined by dice on a CRT.  Supply, fortifications and air power rules are included.  Victory is determined per scenario and is based on liberating cities or for exiting the west edge of the map.&#10;&#10;This is in the same series with Operation Market Garden: Descent Into Hell&#10;&#10;";1983;6.43935;2.6842

Originally published as a stand-alone game by Battleline, Dauntless was later (1981) republished by Avalon Hill as a gamette expansion for the game Air Force.  AH added rules for ships and anti-ship weapons, carrier operations, and rockets.&#10;&#10;From a Battleline catalog:&#10;&#10;DAUNTLESS takes our proven and popular AIR FORCE game system into the skies of the Flying Tigers, Samurai and the &quot;Black Sheep.&quot; The new airplane data charts let you put such renowned aircraft as the P-38 &quot;forked tailed devil,&quot; the incomparably nimble Zero, the aptly named Black Widow, and the awesome B-29 through their paces.  Other veteran war birds include the P-40, Corsair, Val, Kate, Frank, B-25, the SBD (Slow But Deadly) Dauntless, and many more.&#10;&#10;Rules cover all important aspects of the air war in the Pacific: machine guns and cannons, dive bombing, torpedo bombing, level bombing, glide bombing, depth charge bombing, strafing, massed bomber formations, light and heavy flak, fighters, bombers, kamikazes, radar, clouds, industrial targets, vehicular targets, and naval targets, and more.

3609;Crescendo of Doom: A Squad Leader Gamette;"An gamette for the Squad Leader series, concentrating on early WWII (1939-1941) and the units and countries most involved during that time (Poland, Belgium, France, etc).&#10;&#10;The thirty-six page rulebook is presented in programmed instruction format (as introduced in Squad Leader) to introduce its twelve new scenarios.  There are two new 8&quot; X 22&quot; mapboards, and over 1200 counters.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 10&#10;&#10;Mapboards: 6, 7&#10;Scenarios: 21 to 32&#10;&#10;&#10;(From the back of the box:)&#10;&#10;From the Nazi invasion of Poland, through the heroic defense of tiny Finland against the Russian behemoth, the blitzkrieg conquests of Norway and the Low Countries, the Battle of France, and the seizure of Greece, the player is struck by the despair of men and nations alike, as seen by the soldiers who vainly sacrificed their lives against a more powerful aggressor. This is Crescendo of Doom... a gripping game of tactical combat set against the seemingly invincible juggernauts of war-torn Europe. Setting the scene for the colossal struggle of the titans which will follow, Crescendo is, nonetheless, far more than a simple prelude to Barbarossa. While fur&shy;ther refining the innovations brought forth in its highly successful predecessors Squad Leader and Cross of Iron: A Squad Leader Gamette, Crescendo breaks yet even more ground in the realm of realistic tactical combat without disturbing the underlying basic simplicity of a universally acclaimed game system. Crescendo is a welcome extension for the Squad Leader enthusiast even before he [or she] contemplates a single new counter.&#10;&#10;But Crescendo of Doom offers far more than that. Complete armor, ordnance, and infantry units are provided for Poland, Belgium, Finland and a host of other minor neutrals, including Elite, Line, and Reservist formations for all nationalities. In graphic detail, far superior to any narrative account, you will see for yourself how the outnumbered German panzers defeated the superior armor of the French tanks. Experience personally the French frustrations brought on by radioless AFVs and one man turrets. There are no Panthers or T-34s... here it is the Mk III vs. the Char B, Somua, or Matilda.&#10;&#10;And Crescendo of Doom need not end in 1942 with our 32nd scenario. The entire British Order of Battle is presented for the whole of WWII, enabling fans of the Western Desert, Italian, or Normandy campaigns to design their own scenarios for those periods. Crescendo of Doom is more than just a game. When combined with Squad Leader and Cross of Iron: A Squad Leader Gamette, it provides the ultimate in a tactical gaming system which can be used to portray any company or battalion level action. Be forewarned! Crescendo is not an easy game. Do not attempt it unless you have first mastered Squad Leader and Cross of Iron: A Squad Leader Gamette.&#10;&#10;In each game you get: &#10;&#10;     520 double-printed 1/2&quot; die-cut counters representing the men and weapons that comprised the combatants of the Western Front; 1939&middot;1942. &#10;     704 double-printed 5/8&quot; die-cut counters representing the complete vehicular and ordnance Order of Battle for the British.

3611;Backgammon 4;"A nice-looking variant for four players, by the same company that produced Four Player Chess.&#10;&#10;Picture a &quot;rounded square&quot; with six backgammon points on each side of the square, then add three new points in each corner. The board is reversible, with traditional backgammon on the reverse side.&#10;&#10;Regular backgammon rules apply for movement.  The setup is slightly different, since the points &quot;farthest away&quot; from your home court are used by another player, so those 2 stones start one unit closer to home.&#10;&#10;The major change is direction - that all players in a three or four player game are moving clockwise.  Evidently there is no way to set up four players with two running clockwise and two running reverse.&#10;&#10;There are variants listed, including team play where two players can have stones resting on the same point.  For two players on this board, each gets two sets of pieces.&#10;&#10;This game differs from Quadragammon in that there are four complete sets of stones and the board has additional points printed in the corners.  And its main difference, the all-clockwise movement.&#10;&#10;Contents - reversible board (4-fold), 4 sets of stones, 2 dice (!) and rules.&#10;&#10;";1980;5.70721;1.3333
3613;Air Superiority;"A complex simulation of &quot;modern&quot; air to air jet combat.  Each aircraft type has a card with its vital statistics - max speed, ceiling, turn rate, weapons configurations, fuel, etc, etc. Each plane and missile is represented on a hex map by a counter.  Each hex is 1/3 mile and each turn is 12-15 seconds.  Each aircraft also maintains a paper log throughout the game for altitude, weapons usage, throttle setting, speed, etc etc.  Each turn aircraft attempt to spot and/or lock on to opposing craft and move into firing position.  Radar search, lock on, and damage results are by CRT with 10 sided die.  Damage is by level (light, heavy, critical) and cumulative.  There are 30+ base aircraft types and all their variants and 30+ different missiles represented in the game charts.  Victory is by scenario.&#10;&#10;";1987;6.87082;3.92
3615;Agincourt: The Triumph of Archery over Armor, 1415;"Agincourt recreates the well known battle in 1415 of the same name.  Each hex is 34 yards, counters from 250-500 men (1000 if double sized) or 1-2 artillery pieces.  Each turn is 3 minutes.  Each player alternates as the &quot;phasing&quot; player and moves in impulses, after each of which the opposing player can engage in archery fire.  After movement morale is checked and then melee combat may occur.  Combat results are calculated by percentile dice on a CRT.  Losses are imposed by &quot;line&quot; of which units start with 2, 3, or 7.  When a unit loses all its lines it is eliminated.

3619;Chain Reaction;"This pure abstract strategy game is a relatively unknown work by Sid Sackson. Similar in some ways to his 1981 Spiel des Jahres winner, Focus, it is available commercially in a German edition, but can be played with materials improvised from a chessboard and checkers.&#10;&#10;From the translation: The players take alternate turns of up to five segments, trying to move game pieces from their home squares over the opposing goal line, in order to score points. After the first segment of a turn, only towers made of two game pieces may be moved. Each tower is broken down during its move, and one of its pieces may be used to build a new tower on another square. Intelligent use of this move technique can lead to &quot;nuclear chain reactions&quot;, in which up to five towers are involved. There must never be more than one tower on the board at one time. Any tower on the board must be moved during the following turn segment by the player whose piece is on top. The game ends with the achievement of an agreed-upon number of points.&#10;&#10;The game was originally published in 1989 in a tiny cardboard box by Ferdinand de Cassan. In 1990 it was published by Hexagames in their &quot;Exklusiv&quot; series, and later (1993?) by Abacus in their very similar Abacus wood box series.&#10;&#10;";1989;6.4625;2.0

Winners obtain tokens representing survival items such as food and matches, which are useful for other challenges.&#10;&#10;During successive turns in the end game, players vote together on who should be expelled from the island.  When only two people are left, all the other players vote together on who should be the sole Survivor.&#10;&#10;";2000;3.97137;1.2

Players plot courses using a grease pencil on the map and use fuel to accelerate a maximum of one each turn.  Planets and moons are used to modify the trajectory.&#10;&#10;There are a limited number of ships.  Most are limited in fuel, so making efficient use of gravity is important to reaching a destination.&#10;&#10;2nd edition came out in 1981.  A 3rd edition was released in 2018 by Steve Jackson Games.&#10;&#10;It is fairly easy to extend the game to much more than 3 players, although the board can become cluttered with ship trails (the game is sorta like Crayon Rails in this respect).&#10;&#10;";1973;7.0397;2.4583

3655;The Settlers of Canaan;"Settlers of Canaan takes place in the territory of Canaan off the coast of the Great Sea.  Each Player represents a tribe of Israel as they seek to settle the land of Canaan. The time period of the game spans the time of Joshua's conquests of Canaan (Joshua), the turbulent years ruled by judges (Judges) through the choosing and crowning of King David (I &amp; II Samuel).&#10;&#10;The game uses the same basic mechanics as Settlers of Catan but adds some unique elements, similar to the Historical Scenarios. In the case of this game, players build the wall of Jerusalem by contributing bricks. The player who contributes the most bricks earns victory points and the right to use a special &quot;rule-breaking&quot; power of his/her choosing. This is contested in the same manner as &quot;the longest road&quot; from Settlers.&#10;&#10;The German version does not use the build Jeruselem and stones mechanisms. Instead there are 13 hero cards that generate God's help. There are events (cards) that take place. Also the German board has 5 hexes not on the English board and one changed hex as well.&#10;Belongs to the Catan Series.&#10;&#10;";2002;6.73725;2.3171

Some of the EC's are very strong and the player may choose NOT to battle and leave the bldg.&#10;&#10;The game ends when you get 6 points. Points are obtained by rescuing Lost Souls and Heroes and also by vanquishing Evil Forces.

3661;Imperium: Empires in Conflict â Worlds in the Balance;"Imperium is a 2-player game of space empire conflict set in 22nd Century AD, and shortly after release, retconned into the history of the Traveller role playing game. It simulates the clash between Earth (Terra) and an alien civilization, represented in the form of a widespread Empire (the Ziru Sirka). Both sides have a variety of star-ships and ground forces to choose from, and the game is notable for how the two sides are asymmetrical: their forces aren't identical and their economies work differently.&#10;&#10;Movement takes place via 'jumps' from one star to the next, and conflict is resolved at these 'points'. There are two types of star-ship weaponry, short-range beam factors, and chiefly long-range missile factors also used for planetary bombardment.&#10;&#10;";1977;6.90271;2.6164
3663;Outreach: The Conquest of the Galaxy, 3000AD;"[Insert from the back of the flat-pack]&#10;&#10;Outreach is a Grand Strategic simulation of intra-Galactic conflict.  The scale of the game is genuinely huge.  The 23&quot; by 35&quot; map depicts an area some 28,000 light years by 50,000 light years, including about one-third of the Galaxy.  Each 19mm hex measures some 1200 light years across.&#10;&#10;Outreach is concerned with a period of vast, explosive expansion by an ambitious, dynamic civilization.  Each hex on the map is color coded to indicate the relative star density.  The Player is charged with the task of guiding the destiny of a Civilization.  At the start of the basic scenario, only a few thousand light years have been explored and settled, but the capacity for long-range telesthetic inter-stellar shifts has been developed.&#10;&#10;StarFleet units represent not merely particular interstellar vessels, but a concomitant commitment of resources, mainly in terms of time, effort and people (&ldquo;beings&rdquo;).  In general, the object of the Player is to raise his &ldquo;Civilization Level&rdquo; to the highest in the Galaxy.  This is an object which can only be pursued Indirectly- by expanding one's economic base, access to resources, and population, to take a positive view, or by interfering with the progress of other striving civilizations toward that goal.&#10;&#10;The Outreach game system accommodates from one to four Players.&#10;&#10;&#10;Part of the StarForce Trilogy box set, along with StarForce and StarSoldier.&#10;&#10;";1976;6.55816;3.3438
3665;Sumo Arena;"Sumo Arena is a tongue-in-cheek multi-player simulation of Sumo wrestling. Each turn players simultaneously reveal a card that moves their wrestler on a circular-shaped hex board.

There are also ways to &quot;charge&quot;, and &quot;rest&quot;.&#10;&#10;";2001;5.32;2.0
3667;Star Fleet Battle Manual;"Star Fleet Battle Manual (SFBM) is a Tactical level Space Combat miniatures wargame for two or more players with spaceships familiar to fans of Star Trek (the original series).&#10;&#10;SFBM is easily confused with the much better-known and much more complex &quot;Star Fleet Battles&quot; boardgame. Although the theme is the same, and some of the mechanics are quite similar, crawling around on the floor, and spatial skills for estimating firing angles, make SFBM unlike Star Fleet Battles.&#10;&#10;A playing area of perhaps 8 feet square is the minimum requirement, 12 feet square (or more) is better, with a bare floor or very short carpet. Two or more players plop down their starships on the floor. Everyone plots their moves simultaneously, allocating limited engine energy to some combination of movement, shields and weapons. Moves are executed simultaneously. Weapons have varying arcs of fire, and shield strength is independent on the four sides of the ship, so clever move plotting is critical to victory.&#10;&#10;After movement, there is simultaneous combat. Shooting is the unusual element of the mechanics. Each starship has a compass card, with a silhouette in the middle. The player must estimate the exact correct angle to fire at, stretch out a string from the center of their card, and hope that their chosen angle intersects the silhouette of the chosen opponent.&#10;&#10;Damage is logged in points against different capabilities of the starship, allowing for the damaged or crippled ships familiar from the Star Trek TV episodes and films. Different weapons and angles of fire allow for unique abilities for different races and starships.&#10;&#10;The game was originally published in 1972 as Star Trek Battle Manual (this used the Star Trek name without having properly licensed it, and therefore was not sold for long).&#10;&#10;The closely related Alien Space Battle Manual came out in 1973, offering a completely different set of alien races and somewhat different hit/damage rules, but allowing for interplay between the two different games.&#10;&#10;";1977;7.16279;2.375

Knowing which gem to collect and keeping hold of the gems you have acquired is all part of the strategy of playing Dwarves.

Units are deployed on the board, leaving some vulnerable to &quot;first strike&quot; nuclear attacks.  Crisis areas are won by allocating factors to them and causing a confrontation in which each player picks a warfare type (Tac-Nuc, Conventional, Guerrilla, Political/Social, or Economic).  Players may decide to launch a direct nuclear attack on the the other player, attempting to destroy the enemy cities with missiles or bombers while defending his own with ABMs and interceptors.  Victory is determined partly by how much population a player has left after a nuclear war, and partly by how much enemy population has been destroyed and/or crisis regions won.&#10;&#10;";1979;5.78527;3.05

Depicts the often designed fighting in, on and around &quot;Little Round Top&quot; during the Rebel assault in the late afternoon of the 2nd day of Gettysburg. Players receive points for destroying enemy brigades as well as several geographical features of the battlefield such as Little Round Top, Devil's Den, the Peach Orchard, the infamous Wheat Field and the Angle. Silhouette style counters depicting Union and Rebel troops in the traditional Blue and Gray colors add to the feel of the ebb and flow of the fighting. The map is quite small but is more than useful and never seems to get crowded.&#10;&#10;One huge bonus... the game can be played solitaire, as rules have been added so a solo player can take control of the advancing Confederates, whilst the game mechanics take care of the defending Union brigades.&#10;&#10;One wishes that more &quot;smaller&rdquo; scale and sized wargames had been produced over the years, I recommend this game to all ACW wargamers and anyone who likes solo wargaming.&#10;&#10;Nominee for the 1989 Charles S.

The situation might have turned in favor of the French, but hesitation allowed Von Moltke to regroup and prepare a flanking maneuver that assured a German victory.&#10;&#10;Components: &#10;&#10;    400 counters&#10;    16-page rule book&#10;    4 maps on (2) 22&quot; x 34&quot; mapsheets&#10;    1 inch box&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;(BGG description:)&#10;&#10;Quad game depicting 4 battles fought during the 19th century: Inkerman (1854), Solferino (1859), K&ouml;niggratz (1866) and Gravelotte (1870).&#10;&#10;Lots of chrome rules, including command control,different weapon types and morale.

3697;The Couch Potato Game;"A television commercial-watching game designed for rapid party play.  Players get a hand of five cards, either objects or special &quot;Goof Proof&quot; cards.  The game owner selects a channel to watch on television, and when the commercials come on, players race to either find their own objects, or the objects of other players' face up cards so as to block them.  Everybody is trying to get rid of their hand first to win the round.  Perhaps the most engaging aspect of this game is that the card tray is specially designed to hold snacks as well.  The rule book can objectively be designated as quite humorous.&#10;&#10;";1987;4.57895;0.0
3699;Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot;"Killer Bunnies is a funny and satirical non-collectible, expandable card game.  The new Epsilon Edition Starter Deck comes with a bonus Yellow Booster Deck.  This game is played with only 1 copy of the game, so players do NOT need to bring their own decks to the table.&#10;&#10;The object: Collect as many &quot;Carrots&quot; as possible, hoping that one of them is the randomly predetermined &quot;Magic Carrot&quot;.  In doing so, you must keep your bunnies alive as long as possible, while eliminating your opponents' Bunnies because once all the Carrots have been claimed you must have a living Bunny to win.&#10;&#10;The problem: Your opponents are armed with outrageous weapons (from level 1 weapons such as a &quot;Kitchen Whisk&quot; to level 12 weapons such as the &quot;Nuclear Warhead&quot;) and you must roll higher than these levels to survive.&#10;&#10;Use cards to defend your Bunnies, such as the hilarious &quot;Magic Spatula&quot; or other special cards, or use a &quot;Feed The Bunny&quot; card to force your opponent to buy cabbage and water (if they have the money to do so...)&#10;&#10;Your opponents, as the back of the box quotes, &quot;will stop at nothing to keep you from winning the game, which can get dreadfully vengeful, horribly nasty, hilariously messy, and just plain fun!&quot;&#10;&#10;The game includes 165 cards (including the Blue Starter Deck and Yellow Booster Deck), 36 small cards, 6 twelve-sided dice, &amp; Instructions.&#10;&#10;";2002;5.50986;1.8837
3701;Smear;"Players attempt to empty their hand of cards by playing them onto a pattern on the table.  Cards are matched by color to existing series of colors on the table (&quot;runs&quot;) which can be continued or deliberately ended.  If a &quot;run&quot; has a Smear card in it, anyone who adds to that run must draw additional cards after playing.  When one player runs out of cards, the others win points according to what's left in their hands, which is a bad thing as the goal is to finish a set number of rounds with the least amount of points.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.36427;1.1538

Each area starts with 7 points. Cards are played indicating how the cars hit i.e. front-to-front rear-to-driver-side-tire, front-to-Passenger-side-door, etc. When the Tires or Engine are reduced to zero points your car is disabled and you are out of the game. When the Frame is reduced to zero any further hit there will do a point of damage to the Tires and the Engine.&#10;&#10;The toy cars track relative car positions on the playing field since these have an effect on what area of a particular car is available to be hit.&#10;&#10;";1999;5.38462;1.5
3705;Contraband;"One player takes on the role of Customs Agent (this rotates, though) while the others are all travelers who truthfully or falsely declare items in their luggage (four cards drawn from a deck of items including wine, cigars, cameras, necklaces, etc.)  If the Customs Agent believes them, they simply pay a duty fee and then the next player repeats the process.&#10;&#10;If the Customs Agent does not believe the player, they may &quot;search&quot; the player's luggage (cards are revealed) with two results.  If the player declared accurately, the Customs Agent must pay the player 200 for defamation of character.  If the player declared incorrectly, he must pay the Customs Agent fines for all items in his luggage.&#10;&#10;Other players can also act as Informants and search luggage and there is also an attache case in the deck that can give someone diplomatic immunity and allow them to pass through Customs without being searched or paying duty fees.

3739;Bot;"A relaunch of a late 70s release, Bot is a game in which each of the two players command a &quot;serpent&quot; abstractly represented as a line of pawns occupying successive hexes in the gameboard. Players organize and play their hand of cards to direct their serpents' linear movement across the board. To each hexside corresponds a color; each card has a color and a number. Thus, a Yellow-3 card allows a player to move his serpent three hexes in the Yellow direction. Once a serpent successfully reaches (hits) the opposing serpent, it &quot;eats&quot; and removes two of the attacked serpent's pawns from the game. The same cannibalistic result is achieved if you successfully drive your serpent towards the enemy home base. Serpents may defend by biting their own tail, forming an impregnable ring, or by using the board's &quot;underground tunnel&quot; for a quick escape. First player to reduce the enemy serpent to nothingness is the winner. The name Bot is a homophone for &quot;bote&quot;, a Brazilian Portuguese noun meaning &quot;serpent strike&quot;.&#10;&#10;";2001;6.05882;1.75

3797;Grade Up to Elite Cow;"A promotional/educational game &quot;of skill and chance for Dairy Farmers&quot; made by Waddingtons of behalf of &quot;The British Friesian Cattle Society of Great Britain and Ireland&quot; as a fundraising exercise in which proceeds from the game went to the Y.M.A (Young Members Association) of the said Society.&#10;&#10;Players attempt to gradually &quot;grade up&quot; their mixed non-pedigree and pedigree dairy herd to achieve pedigree status in just three generations. The mechanism for doing so involves following the real life process of getting female offspring from an animal that is considered typical of the breed and showing no obvious signs of cross breeding (and thus qualified to be entered in the &quot;A&quot; Section of the Supplementary Register of the Herd Book maintained by the Society as ASR). These female offspring would be qualified to be entered in the &quot;B&quot; Section of the Supplementary Register as BSR cows, and their pure bred offspring would in turn qualify as CSR animals. The daughters of CSR animals can then be registered in the Herd Book proper and become full pedigree cows.&#10;&#10;Full pedigree animals that achieve certain standards of milk and butterfat production then can be entered into the Register of Merit (can carry the suffix RM) and an RM cow that has calved at least three times, had two yearly yields entered in the RM and has at least 76 point in Type Classification (out of 100 in a system of grading desired breed characteristics) in turn qualifies as an RMX standard cow (X for Excellent).&#10;&#10;RMX cows who achieve a lifetime milk yield of at least 50 long tonnes and have scored at least 85 point in Type Classification finally qualify to grade up to Elite Cow.&#10;&#10;The object in simplified game terms is to be the first player to grade up at least 4 cows (out of a starting 6) to that Elite Cow status and thus win the game.&#10;&#10;";1986;5.55556;2.0

The game was inspired by the Clinton-Lewinsky sex scandal and the design is a satire of that and all other scandals in history.  The cards are divided into categories, each representing elements of a good public scandal:  the Target, the Trigger, the Transgression, the Trumpeters (media), the Tidbits, and the Testimonials.&#10;&#10;Players take turns adding a card to the growing scandal.  Only one target, trigger, and transgression may be in play at any given time, and each is required for a complete scandal, but multiple cards from other categories may be added freely.  When the three required elements are present, a player may trigger a scoring round by playing one of two &quot;It's History!&quot; cards.  Scandals are thus generated until one player reaches a target total score.&#10;&#10;The 54 cards are each marked with standard playing card rank and suit (to allow use for traditional card games), and many sport photos of nude or scantily clad women (the box carries a &quot;not for sale to minors under 18&quot; warning).

This is the Gamewright version.&#10;&#10;1996 Mensa Select&#10;&#10;Republished 2002 by Amigo as Biberbande:&#10;&#10;Biberbande is a card game for Ages 6 and up, the object of which is to improve your initial unknown 4-card hand so that you have a lower sum of cards than the other players. There are 66 cards in the deck, which consists of ranks 0-9 (four of ranks 0-8 and nine 9's) and 3 different types of action cards (9 &quot;Exchange&quot;, 7 &quot;Spy&quot;, and 5 &quot;2 X draw&quot;). Four cards are dealt face down to each player so that no player knows the values of her cards. The four cards are then arranged in a row and each player may briefly look at her outer two cards. A player's turn consists of drawing a card from the top of the draw pile or discard pile. If the player drew from the draw pile, there are several possible actions: If it is a number card, she may replace one of her face down cards with it (placing it face down) or she may simply discard it. If it is an action card, she may carry out the action or ignore the action. If a player draws the top card of the discard pile, she must replace one of her face down cards with it (placed face down). A player may knock at the end of her turn meaning that each other player has one more turn before the round is over. When the round ends, players turn over their cards and add up their values. The player with the lowest total value wins. Generally the game is played with as many rounds as there are players. Player interaction comes in the form of the action cards. The 'Exchange' card allows a player to exchange one of his cards with one of his opponents. The 'Spy' card allows a player to look at one of his own cards. Finally the &quot;2X look&quot; card allows a player to look at the top card of the draw pile, then keep it or throw it away. If she throws it away, she must use the next card in the draw pile.&#10;&#10;";1995;6.25736;1.1172

It is a sister game to Echelons of Fury, which pits players as World War 2 German and American commanders.&#10;&#10;Players build up their armies in the form of their own deck of cards, which represent supplies, units (air and land), weapons, equipment, and orders.  The objective is to destroy the enemy headquarters (HQ).  To go on the offensive, deployed units have to be ordered with maneuver cards, which direct the attack along one of three terrain cards between the players.  The defender can freely choose among his deployed units to meet the attackers on that terrain.  The outcome of the resultant combat depends on the influence of the terrain card, the involved units and their attached equipment.  If the attack is not defended against, the attackers inflict damage on the HQ.&#10;&#10;The game ends in a victory to the attacker when he or she has inflicted enough damage (typically 20) to their enemy's HQ.&#10;&#10;";1995;4.4875;1.8571

3849;Red Zone;"A collectible card game (CCG) where players take the part of an owner/coach of a professional (United States) football team and play a football game vs each other.&#10;&#10;It uses a built play deck reminiscent of other CCG games, and that same play deck is used as both a timer and an indicator of results for the games called offensive and defensive plays.&#10;&#10;The opponents match decks versus each other, as well as a lineup of face-up starters on each side of the &quot;ball.&quot;&#10;&#10;Each coach calls a play simultaneously, and results of the combination of the plays and the performance of the individual player(s) involved are checked also.&#10;&#10;The Play wheel chart makes this quite efficient.  Base gamers, who do not have this wheel are left to consult a chart which cross-references the results.  The Play wheel streamlines the game--and decreases the down time significantly.&#10;&#10;The game is played in quarters like in regular football, timed by the use of a time-deck.  Coaches can implement double-teams, and run trick plays versus the other.&#10;&#10;The offensive plays available in the expansion set was significant to opening up the play books for each coach, including never-before-seen plays on both sides of the ball.  Additionally, certain players were hybrid players.&#10;&#10;The most notable of these was the Kordell Stewart card which we used to call &quot;slash&quot; like his on the field nickname:  Because he is a QB/WR/RB, and has stats which are superlative for all three positions.  This makes him a valuable asset to any team.&#10;&#10;Special Rare and Ultra-Rare cards allowed special abilities or results to be played from the hand of either coach, assisting in particular offensive and defensive plays.  Some cards also result in penalties, fumbles, interceptions, and big plays.&#10;&#10;";1995;4.625;1.5

3855;Crimson Skies;"Crimson Skies is a character-based board game of dogfighting and dive bombing in an aviation-dominated world; a simple, fast-playing game of pulp-fiction-style air combat.  It is a game about the men and women who pilot flying nightmares, the metal-sheathed birds of prey that spit death from the sky.&#10;&#10;In Crimson Skies, you are at the top of the aviation food chain - a fighter pilot, one of the fearless men and women who take to the skies each day for honor or profit.  Each player generates a minimum of two characters, a pilot and his or her wingman.  If your characters survive from mission to mission, they gain experience that can translate into better skills, and thus even better chances for future survival and success.  While this is a combat board game, not a roleplaying game, telling tales about your characters will invest the game with action, drama and humor, making the game-playing experience even more enjoyable.&#10;&#10;";1998;7.15933;2.9333

Each side has nine short cylinders, eight large cylinders and one &quot;master&quot; large cylinder.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to capture your opponents MASTER.(That is a wooden token). You do this by rolling the dice and move your counters the given numbers of squares according to the movement rules.  Players take turns to roll the die and move one piece the number of squares shown, or a six may be used to move two pieces a total of six squares.  The small counters move and capture in only one direction - straight ahead. Whenever a small counter reaches its opponent's back row, it is exchanged for a large one. The large counters, including the MASTER, move and capture in any direction.&#10;&#10;";1983;3.0;0.0

In an attempt to escape, 007 steals one of the villain Kananga&rsquo;s boats. Can you complete the escape? Find out in this thrilling boat chase through the Louisiana bayou with Kananga&rsquo;s men in hot pursuit.&rdquo; This game was designed for two players aged eight and up.&#10;&#10;Extremely rare collector's item, to my knowledge only published in England due to copyright problems. This simple game (Ages 8 and up) is part of the then successful James Bond franchise of Victory Games. It was an attempt to create a simple 2-player game which would also appeal to kids (in contrast to their more complex efforts like the faulted &quot;James Bond Assault Game&quot;). It is basically the race from the movie &quot;Live and let Die&quot; - James Bond uses a motorboat to escape the evil henchmen of Kananga. Simple Action-System with small stand-up-boats and an abstract and slightly boring (small) board. Not a total waste of time - it actually works as a fast 2-player game.&#10;&#10;";1985;5.46667;1.2

3867;The Hammer of Thor: The Game of Norse Mythology;"Probably the most comprehensive mythology game ever made, certainly about Norse myths. There are 365 cards, each one a different character from Norse mythology (which is why the game says that 365 people can play!)&#10;&#10;Play evolves along two phases: adventures in the wilderness to gather forces for Ragnarok, the final battle between good and evil. The player who is on the winning side of this battle who has the highest Reputation wins the game. Beyond the 365 character cards, there are card sets representing Offspring, Shape Changing, Magic Items, Forged Magic Items, Fates, Runes, and Predictions.

3871;Factories;"In Factories the object is to collect at least one of each of the ten resources. This is done by creating factories with the cards drawn. A factory consists of one output card, and any number of equation cards. By paying the costs in the equation cards, in order, you produce whatever the output card indicates.&#10;&#10;This alone would be a little like solitaire, so enter the challenge you can make once per turn. Challenge anyone for up to three resources, and then each bid a secret amount more. Whoever has more wins everything, unless they overbid by more than three in which case the lower bid wins! This allows for player interaction, although not a high degree of such.&#10;&#10;";2001;4.83333;2.0
3879;What's Up, Doc?;"You're suffering from some strange sickness and rush to the hospital to see the doc; only to find other patients also trying to get to him, too. You make your way through the hospital (roll and move, with some path choices) heading for the doc's office on the top floor. On your way, try to guess the other players' sickness (deduction) and send them back to the entrance. Be the first to get to the doc and you win. - The strategy consists of keeping track of what other players already know about you, so that you can choose the best path thru the hospital corridors. Kids love the humorous disease names such as &quot;Glumps&quot;, &quot;Running Nose&quot;, &quot;Kung-Flu&quot;, and &quot;Stinkfoot&quot;.

3883;4th Reich: Puremen vs. the Mutants for Control of the World;"&quot;4th Reich: Puremen vs. the Mutants for Control of the World&quot; is a somewhat obscure wargame by Task Force Games based on (albeit without attribution) the SF-novel &quot;The Iron Dream&quot; by the Jewish author Norman Spinrad. This very controversial novel describes a parallel world in which Hitler wasn't successful with his &quot;Kampf&quot; in Germany and became a successful SF-pulp-novelist in the US. The main part of the book is the actual text of Hitler's &quot;Iron Dream&quot;, a pulp-tale about &quot;Ubermenschen&quot; conquering a future world filled with mutant &quot;scum.&quot; The idea of Spinrad's novel was to expose fascist tendencies in 50's American literature. The TFG designers transported this &quot;theme&quot; into a board game which plays like a wargame: future Nazis against future mutants. The names of all protagonists have been changed in an apparent attempt to avoid infringement, but the game clearly takes its slightly tongue-in-cheek approach directly from the book.&#10;&#10;";1985;5.08477;2.1111

3889;Ali Baba;"User review: The treasure cards are placed face down in their slots as nine stacks of four cards. The lid is placed on top of them. The lid has nine dials. Each dial has one of six symbols showing. To access the treasure cards beneath the lid the players alternate turns to twist the dials to show the combination of symbols which match the genie card that is in play. When the genie card has been matched, the player may take as many treasure cards as desired. If a player finds a snake card among the treasure cards taken then the player forfeits all treasure cards taken that turn. Whenever a player is done taking treasure cards a new genie card is put in play and the game continues.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the final genie card is out of play or the final snake has been found. The player with the highest total in treasure cards is the winner.

3895;Silent Death;"Silent Death is a space combat game, normally played with miniatures. Most ships are fighter and heavy-fighters in size, but there are expansions to include gunboats and small capital ships. Each ship has a control sheet to make all bookkeeping (mostly damage and ammo when necessary) easier.

The mix of design trade-offs (detail for playability) in the Standard Game feels about right, but since you can't satisfy all of the people all of the time, we piled in a bunch of optional rules so players can find their own optimum mix; either simpler or more complex.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented in:&#10;&#10;    Silent Death: The Next Millennium Deluxe Edition&#10;&#10;&#10;";1990;6.99596;2.7627

3903;Nuclear Escape;"A game with an obvious political agenda (arms reduction) that succeeds anyway (at being an entertaining game).  Each team plays either the U.S. or the U.S.S.R. with a large nuclear weapons stockpile.  Most of the fun comes in the negotiations and voting.  Both sides win if they succeed in reducing the nuclear stockpile, Nuclear Escape.  One side can win by having less than 100 million in casualties, AND significantly more nuclear weapons than the other side and the rest of the world, Nuclear Domination.  The &quot;game&quot; wins with massive nuclear war, Nuclear Suffering (some of humanity survives) and Nuclear Annihilation (no humans survive).  Status quo is maintained (Nuclear Tension) if the world ends up on the &quot;end of game&quot; space with none of the other conditions having occurred.

Who among the gunmen is a Deputy, ready to sacrifice himself for the Sheriff? And who is a merciless Outlaw, willing to kill him? If you want to find out, just draw (your cards)!&quot; (From back of box)&#10;&#10;The card game BANG! recreates an old-fashioned spaghetti western shoot-out, with each player randomly receiving a Character card to determine special abilities, and a secret Role card to determine their goal.&#10;&#10;Four different Roles are available, each with a unique victory condition:&#10;&#10;     Sheriff - Kill all Outlaws and the Renegade&#10;     Deputy - Protect the Sheriff and kill any Outlaws&#10;     Outlaw - Kill the Sheriff&#10;     Renegade - Be the last person standing&#10;&#10;&#10;A player's Role is kept secret, except for the Sheriff.

Most common are the BANG! cards, which let you shoot at another player, assuming the target is within &quot;range&quot; of your current gun.  The target player can play a &quot;MISSED!&quot; card to dodge the shot.  Other cards can provide temporary boosts while in play (for example, different guns to improve your firing range) and special one-time effects to help you or hinder your opponents (such as Beer to restore health, or Barrels to hide behind during a shootout). A horse is useful for keeping your distance from unruly neighbors, while the Winchester can hit a target at range 5. The Gatling is a deadly exception where range doesn't matter: it can only be used once, but targets all other players at the table!&#10;&#10;Information on the cards is displayed using language-independent symbols, and 7 summary/reference cards are included.&#10;&#10;";2002;6.489;1.6321
3957;Bioscopy;"The object of Bioscopy is to be the first player or team to score 20 points in each of the 4 categories of trivia (Who, What, When, and Where).&#10;&#10;Each player or team puts their playing marker at the center of the board, and their 4 scoring markers on the 0 at the start of each of the 4 scoring scrolls. Players take turns rolling a six-sided die to determine how far you may move on the board, moving in any direction they choose (but they may not visit the same space twice in a turn). The spaces on the board are color coded to each of the 4 categories of questions, and are marked with a number (10, 7, 4, and 1) that corresponds to the difficulty of the clue. Each card has 4 clues on it, descending in value (10, 7, 4, and 1). Players may hear the clues in descending value until they reach the minimum value indicated on their space on the board -- if they can successfully answer at a higher point clue value, they will receive the higher points.&#10;&#10;An alternate form of scoring is based on stealing points from the opponents by landing on a space on the board without a number. When this happens, the player competes head-to-head with the person that has scored the most points on that category's scoring scroll.&#10;&#10;";2000;5.7;1.0

3961;Prospecting;"The gameboard is a 7x9 grid. The players draw from a bag containing seventy-eight tiles called nuggets. Each nugget represents one of six metals. Each player, in turn, places one, two or three nuggets on the gameboard. The nuggets placed must match each other, however. After placement of the nuggets, the player may purchase up to two shares of stock of the mines represented by the nuggets on the gameboard. The player then ends the turn by replacing the nuggets played with nuggets from the bag. Every subsequent turn has each player beginning the turn by collecting profit based on the number of shares owned and the size of each mine and rarity of the metal therein.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the gameboard is filled.

A Run is four or more cards in the same suit in sequence. A Group is three or more of a kind. A Word is formed using the letters on the cards and can be any non-proper word found in a standard dictionary. A game consists of seven rounds, and in each round a player must form a specific number of Runs, Groups and Words.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt a number of cards, the exact number of which varies depending on the round in play. Each turn the player draws the top card from the deck or from the discard pile then plays as many cards as possible (either by forming new Runs, Groups or Words or by adding them onto cards which have already been played, either by themselves or by other players). Finally, they discard one of their remaining cards. The round ends when one player manages to empty their hand.&#10;&#10;Players gain points by forming the number of Groups, Runs and Words specified for the round and for the cards in the melds they created. They lose points for cards left in their hand when the round ends.

Each turn, the active player rolls the die then either moves Bruno a number of spaces equal to the number of dots on the die or leaves him in place; when moving Bruno, a player cannot touch the tray he holds or any honey jars already balanced on his head. In either case, the player ends his turn by stacking a new honey jar on the highest jar on Bruno's tray.&#10;&#10;The honey jars come in six sizes, making stacking tricky; should any jar fall while a player moves Bruno, that player loses one of two honey drops he was given at the start of the game. Once a player loses both honey drops, the game ends and whoever has the most honey drops in hand wins.&#10;&#10;The HABA edition of Strong Stuff! includes a special die for experienced players in which you're challenged to spin Bruno in place or move him only with your right or left hand.

All counters are back-printed, since any unit may change sides.&#10;&#10;(from the back of the box)&#10;&#10;Originally published in The Space Gamer #55, September 1982.&#10;&#10;";1982;5.9724;2.5455

3996;Sudden Death!;"Sudden Death is a surround placement type of game. During your turn you place down 1 of 3 different plastic pieces made up of either two, three or four squares. The board consists of 441 squares and each player starts on his own side. The object is to block the other players to prevent them from playing any more pieces. You are allowed to jump over one square. To speed up game play, the designers included a button connected to a 9-volt battery and to a timer in the middle of the board. The button slowly rises and after a certain number of seconds, a buzzer goes off. If the buzzer goes off, you pay a penalty of losing 2 two-square pieces. The timer can be set to go either quickly or slowly.&#10;&#10;";1978;5.4859;1.6667
3997;Round Four;"Round Four is a variant of Connect Four. 2-4 players can play at the same time. The object is still to match four of your color chips in a straight line. The board is four circles inside of each other. the three outer most circles have 16 holes for pieces while the inner circle only has eight. Also some of the holes can fit two pieces inside of it, one on top the other. An added depth to this game is that each circle can be rotated clockwise. During your turn, you can either place a piece, or rotate one of the rings clockwise, causing all of the pieces to shift on that circle. The winner has four of his color pieces in a straight line starting from the inner circle and moving out.&#10;&#10;";1986;6.05;1.0
3998;Fortune;"In Fortune, each player makes money by buying plants, fuel and computers with which to produce goods.  Such goods are distributed by one of a number of distributors, depending on how much you are selling.  Players may also make money by becoming major shareholders in any of the distribution or service firms around the board.  Special dice are used for takeovers.  Players may also buy insurance, consultancy and advertisement to insure against any loss, improve their sales or assist their business's effectiveness.&#10;&#10;The winner is decided by predetermined conditions; either playing for a set time or reaching a monetary target.&#10;&#10;";1976;6.05394;2.2
3999;Diabolo;"Diabolo is a card game in which the cards, most showing a single letter (along with a few wild cards that may be used as any letter), are dealt one at a time, face-up, onto the table. The first player to correctly shout out a word formed from the letters represented on the cards collects the cards used to form the word. If an incorrect guess is made, all other players take one card from the table (or from the draw deck if there are not enough cards showing). Play ends when the draw deck is exhausted and no more words can be formed. The player with the most cards at the end is the winner.&#10;&#10;Re-Implemented by My Word!&#10;&#10;";1999;5.63178;1.1818
