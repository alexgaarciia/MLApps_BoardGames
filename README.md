# MLApps_BoardGames
This repository contains the full implementation of our final project for the Machine Learning Applications course, titled "Board Games NLP Analysis."

We combine Natural Language Processing and recommender systems to analyze board game descriptions, extract semantic insights, and provide personalized game recommendations through a fully interactive dashboard.

## üîç Project Overview
- NLP Pipeline: Cleaning, vectorizing, and embedding over 4,000 board game descriptions using TF-IDF, GloVe, and BERT/SBERT.
- Topic Modeling: Discovering themes across games with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
- Sentiment Analysis: Predicting emotions and vibes with a zero-shot transformer.
- Recommender Systems: Implementing content-based, collaborative (KNN/SVD), and hybrid recommenders with cold-start solutions.
- Dashboard: Built in Dash, allowing users to explore the dataset and receive personalized, explainable recommendations.
